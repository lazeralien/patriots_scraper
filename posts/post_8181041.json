Thing is - theres enough pain that folks will be talking about this during thanksgiving; as the republicans are \"in charge\" they will get more blame most likely. If the shutdown persisted through christmas you can be damn sure that dems would be getting shit. If the republicans don't cede on the ACA then the democrats are going to tell the public that everyone is getting increased healthcare costs for christmas! Furthermore at the end of January they will demand it be put into law regardless; if the republicans refuse then your back into a shutdown as midterms will draw closer and closer everyday and really all the democrats will do is repeat \"ACA\" and how the mid december vote arguments against it were in bad faith...or hell; if Thune doesn't keep his word then the republicans are basically fucked. permalink parent award report block reply Toohershat 8 points 2 days ago Durbin has aged like Biden. permalink award report block reply Insatiable 8 points 2 days ago Did he say 29 years?

If so, that is indeed colossally fucking gay. permalink parent award report block reply AdmrlNelson 4 points 2 days ago He mentions it as a concession to end the shutdown permalink parent award report block reply joggin_noggin 3 points 2 days ago Might be the temporary layoffs - after 60 days of shutdown they can legally become permanent, but if the government is funded by day 59 then they can return. I'm speculating here because I haven't gone out to read the relevant sections of the US Code but it would appear that the Dems were concerned that we'd actually get to day 60 if they didn't agree to let the CR pass the Senate, and Donald Trump would have carte blanche to shutter entire agencies at that point, with no more than an agency head and a few trusted deputies left for the next three years. I wanted that outcome. It would've been glorious to reduce the federal payrolls by millions and deal real, permanent damage to the administrative state. permalink parent award report block reply AdmrlNelson 3 points 2 days ago You're not missing anything. Republicans fucked us over yet again. Feckless, worthless, losers. permalink parent award report block reply yarg 3 points 2 days ago Nobody starved. If anything they were just more embarrassed getting their handouts, as they should be. permalink award report block reply sun_wolf 3 points 2 days ago The rhetoric is so hysterical. A couple people might have had to pay for their Cheetos with a credit card. That\u2019s the modern definition of \u201cstarving\u201d. permalink parent award report block reply Dev404 3 points 2 days ago As if either party in Congress cares about any of us beyond collecting our taxes for them to spend on their luxurious lifestyles. If they could replace us all with machines and starve us all to death while collecting the money made from the machines, they'd do it. However, that pesky 2nd amendment makes them nervous so they'll never stop trying to take it away. permalink award report block reply Scot 3 points 2 days ago President Trump had over a month to fire more leftist traitors. He should not have threatened it if he had no plan on ever following through. permalink award report block reply TiggerLovingPooh 3 points 2 days ago Why does CSPAN have some faggot ass \"government shutdown\" clock on the screen.

God damn I hate clickbait shit. permalink award report block reply Rusty_Bungus 1 points 2 days ago They aren't stupid...they're evil. permalink award report block reply Constitution_1788 1 points 2 days ago They got absolutely steamrolled. It\u2019s glorious. permalink award report block reply Induceddrag 1 points 2 days ago What I don\u2019t understand is that people actually believe these 8 senators suddenly switched sides on this bill.  I fully believe that Schumer and his inner circle decided they were losing and assembled a group of senators to pass the CR. This is all political theater and many of the pundits from both sides seem a bit daft taking the votes on their face value.  Neither side wanted any of the blame for widespread airline chaos over the Thanksgiving holidays. permalink award report block reply Belleoffreedom 1 points 2 days ago Durbin was not his usual self as he read that statement.  I wonder what happened to him. permalink award report block reply DieHeretic 1 points 2 days ago He's 80 years old and in rapid physical decline.\nDurbin has already announced his retirement and will not seek a sixth term in the midterms.\nHis current term will end in January 2027. I'd give odds he won't make it, he looks like cancer is eating on him. permalink parent award report block reply TheDevilMonkey 1 points 2 days ago Only thing \"cooked\" is 3/4 of the brains around here... permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 3 points 2 days ago Wasn't Eric Daugherty one of the accounts that was busted taking bribes from soda companies? permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 1 points 2 days ago He gets stickied a lot for some reason\u2026 permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 2 days ago There's not a very big ecosystem of \"MAGA influencers\".

Apparently Riley Gaines told them to fuck off. permalink parent award report block reply TheDevilMonkey 1 points 2 days ago Lmfao. permalink parent award report block reply DieHeretic 1 points 2 days ago I know it won't happen as Thune is a gutless wonder, but as soon as the vote is taken on the continuing resolution Thune should fuck the democrats right in the ass with red-hot poker and renege on any other part of the deal. permalink award report block reply Gonzotron5000 1 points 2 days ago When I was you g in the 90s the Democrats claimed the Republicans wanted to starve children because they wanted to cut school lumch programs. Then they roasted school lunches for being horrible. Now they (the democrats) are actually starving children. permalink award report block reply 74lampshades 1 points 2 days ago \"Starve children\". Yeah, I don't buy that. No kid is going to die of hunger. permalink award report block reply sun_wolf 1 points 2 days ago I doubt anyone even lost 5 pounds. permalink parent award report block reply Its_Time 0 points 2 days ago So both parties deprived children of food to score poltical points.  All of them despicable. permalink award report block reply DieHeretic 1 points 2 days ago Not one child was deprived of food by the government, their parents refusing to get a job did that. permalink parent award report block reply Rudy_DankMemer 0 points 2 days ago Starvation I'm still waiting for photographic evidence of one single American becoming emaciated during the last 30 days.

We need to get rid of all gibs. permalink parent award report block reply berserkerbarrage 2 points 2 days ago The Democrats shut down the government and deliberately defunded SNAP so that they could falsely blame Trump and the Republicans. Whether or not I personally support SNAP is irrelevant to the conversation. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT 0 points 2 days ago From the overwhelming consensus here the past few weeks, they did us a huge favor then and did something we desperately want done but would never have to balls to do. permalink parent award report block reply conservativefrank -2 points 2 days ago Meanwhile, Newsome is the next President. permalink award report block reply\nredditadminssuckit 68 points 2 days ago I think the bigger headline is that literally said shutting down the government was all about protesting Trump. permalink award report block reply EgregiousPhilbin 27 points 2 days ago And if people starve, so be it.

Thing is - theres enough pain that folks will be talking about this during thanksgiving; as the republicans are \"in charge\" they will get more blame most likely. If the shutdown persisted through christmas you can be damn sure that dems would be getting shit. If the republicans don't cede on the ACA then the democrats are going to tell the public that everyone is getting increased healthcare costs for christmas! Furthermore at the end of January they will demand it be put into law regardless; if the republicans refuse then your back into a shutdown as midterms will draw closer and closer everyday and really all the democrats will do is repeat \"ACA\" and how the mid december vote arguments against it were in bad faith...or hell; if Thune doesn't keep his word then the republicans are basically fucked. permalink parent award report block reply\nKlaus73 3 points 2 days ago I mean tactically they are regrouping.

I'm speculating here because I haven't gone out to read the relevant sections of the US Code but it would appear that the Dems were concerned that we'd actually get to day 60 if they didn't agree to let the CR pass the Senate, and Donald Trump would have carte blanche to shutter entire agencies at that point, with no more than an agency head and a few trusted deputies left for the next three years. I wanted that outcome. It would've been glorious to reduce the federal payrolls by millions and deal real, permanent damage to the administrative state. permalink parent award report block reply AdmrlNelson 3 points 2 days ago You're not missing anything.
