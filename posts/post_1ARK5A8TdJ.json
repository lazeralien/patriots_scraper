Her posture is so bad, she looks like she's about to fold in half at any second. permalink parent award report block reply Hikedelics 31 points 3 days ago That one had me cracking up. I have done group exercise stuff in the past. For a long time actually. Those always seem to devolve into being more about drinking beer afterwards than the actual workout itself. On the other hand I\u2019ve been lifting weights in my basement since March. I just looked this up yesterday and I\u2019m at 237 workouts in 247 days, or 96%. Those groups never held me anywhere near that kind of standard. permalink parent award report block reply schnazzmizzle 10 points 3 days ago Having your own equipment is wonderful. permalink parent award report block reply bananaguard62 1 points 3 days ago What's your exercise of choice?  I'm guessing lots of disc golf? permalink parent award report block reply Hikedelics 4 points 3 days ago I\u2019m almost exclusively weight lifting this year. Admittedly each day isn\u2019t some kind of marathon session. I\u2019m doing 2 lifts each work out. 6 sets with 8 reps. My rotation currently goes like this: Monday 3am: Bench Press + Barbell Squat Tuesday 3pm: Overhead Press + Dead lift Wednesday 3am: barbell curls + tricep rope push downs Thursday 3pm: Bench press + barbell squat Friday 3am:  Overhead Press + deadlift Saturday (whenever) barbell curls + tricep rope push downs Sunday (whenever) barbell skull crushers + either 5 mile run or 10 mile bike ride pulling my son in a trailer to this big play ground he likes. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... booblitchutz 16 points 3 days ago She wants a Crossfitter, but knows that\u2019s not cool anymore. permalink parent award report block reply Trump454748 11 points 3 days ago That would actually be an excellent play area for her cats. permalink parent award report block reply mikethemarine 30 points 3 days ago he HAS to have hair, But she doesn't he can't wear jewelry, but yet she does, must be religious, but ye\\t she really isn't. This person is one fucking losers, She just wants the MILLION plus wage earner permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 17 points 3 days ago This person is one fucking losers, It was  predicted by MorganStanley in 2019 that 45% (almost HALF) of women will be single, never married and childless by 2030. IIRC, it has already been moved up to OVER 50%, so we'll see how it plays out at 2030. The woman in the OP is not an exception. She is MUCH more toward the norm today. Here is the longer, maybe complete video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00_xnbkuiXw permalink parent award report block reply Kolob64 7 points 3 days ago Ewww, no wonder my son is still single. permalink parent award report block reply HOSEQ 10 points 3 days ago Yes, but she also want's to be \"\"The FIRST Wife\"\".... And according to all the stats and Movies we've seen, we know where this leads.... She want's to make sure she gets Life Long Alimony AFTER she makes his life into a Living hell, and he finally dumps her, usually for the second Wife, who will be Younger, and less controlling.... permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 1 points 3 days ago Yeah, don't fret or blame him. MANY of the younger guys have already woke up and walked away. Be glad that he's not willing to be treated badly, and no... he's very likely NOT gay. Unfortunately, that is 1 of society's ways of trying to force/trick men into keeping a woman, regardless of how bad they are. \"Are you gay?\" permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... A_Little_White_Duck 4 points 3 days ago After watching the full video, pretty sure it's a parody. They try to suppress laughter at one point. But it is still low-key funny. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 1 points 3 days ago It's not. It's not a 1-off. The matchmaker has posted plenty of these type videos and has a well-known legit business that you can look up. None of this is new. thelovearchitects.com permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

The want top tier work for methhead prices. You see, I'm just a sole White independent tradesman they view as 'cheap' help. These are the people that would fight me tooth and nail that replacement of a toilet flange isn't going to be more than $100 but happily shell out $2,500 to have 13 \"pest control\" stakes installed around their lawn or, even Jesus Christ, $450 to have a kitchen faucet replaced! permalink parent award report block reply deleted 7 points 3 days ago view 10 more comments... Transparency 5 points 3 days ago I'm a 1-man operation also. I don't deal with the cheapos. I've told people straight-up: \"I'm not the cheapest guy and I don't try to be. If price is a major factor for you, then I am likely not the guy for you.\" I'm in an industry that sounds similar to whatever you do -ie, lots of competition. I call people back same day, I have great communication, I arrive... and magically, I arrive on time. I get people legitimately calling me \"Sir\", and genuinely thanking me for calling them back, showing up, showing up on time, great work, etc. I don't negotiate. They take my price or leave it. I don't care. When people start making it \"too complicated/difficult\" I cut them loose. They NEVER turn out to be worth the aggravation, time, effort, etc. MOST of the people that seem to have genuine problems with pricing seem to be people in their 80s or older. They grew up when people worked for $5/WEEK and once they get over the line they just can't seem to keep up, IME. Not all. Not even most, IME. But that's where I see a few struggling the most (mentally) over price. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

Networth is still a high bar, but she wants salary permalink parent award report block reply MAGA9428 30 points 3 days ago My thoughts exactly\u2026 You could disregard every other thing she said. That one request alone is already absurdly unreasonable. permalink parent award report block reply HuggableBear 2 points 2 days ago No one with that salary is speaking to a matchmaking service, ever. permalink parent award report block reply Big-E 17 points 3 days ago And of those men, most are married already. permalink parent award report block reply GoodGuyNixon 16 points 3 days ago Right, a millionaire probably isn\u2019t just making a seven figure salary. His wealth comes from holdings, and he\u2019s probably making a six figure salary. For a seven figure salary she\u2019s looking at like a D1 college football coach, who probably isn\u2019t going to be checking many of the other boxes. permalink parent award report block reply Mydogisbetter 11 points 3 days ago It takes 25 years to build a resume that leads to that kind of salary.  Dumb bitch isn't rooted in reality.   If he has a 7 figure salary chances are he has been married or has kids.  Truly stupid people out there. permalink parent award report block reply The_Emperor 5 points 3 days ago Or a King of some country...she wants prince charming, who goes to the gym, feeds cats, tailors his wardrobe, and had the time to bring in a million a year? She's looking for an arranged marriage into old money.  She has some of her own...her pearls and the plantation shutters behind her ain't cheap. She's like a computer data analyst...not the kind of loving persona that would attract men worthy of her. permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 1 points 3 days ago Basically the only type of man that would hit her standards and be under 30 is a pro sports player. There's, what, 400 if those across all games being paid that much, if that. Not exactly a big market permalink parent award report block reply TheRedPike 36 points 3 days ago It was the smoothie that broke her. permalink parent award report block reply McFatty7 29 points 3 days ago She's like 'thanks for the free matchmaker money'. \"Sorry couldn't find your man, but if you keep paying me, I totally promise keep looking.\" She's better off with an AI boyfriend. At least that removes her from the gene pool. permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 18 points 3 days ago Ai boyfriend won't pay her Kardashian money for being a frigid mid permalink parent award report block reply 3-10 17 points 3 days ago She ain\u2019t even mid. permalink parent award report block reply McFatty7 8 points 3 days ago Mid is still being generous.

What the hell is on it's head? permalink parent award report block reply Tellman125 11 points 3 days ago She's concerned about finding a guy who fits her spreadsheet of non-negotiable requirements, but actually the number of wealthy CEO bodybuilders who ARE out there for her is literally infinite--if we're talking about AI-generated ones. Reminds me of CryptoPunk NFTs and how thousands could be generated in a second. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 4 points 3 days ago \"Sorry couldn't find your man, but if you keep paying me, I totally promise keep looking.\" I hate to see people scammed, but she really does deserve to be played that way. Can she not hear herself talk? I guarantee if a group did an intervention she still would not wake up enough to remove more than 5% of her ridiculous expectations. permalink parent award report block reply Tellman125 21 points 3 days ago She almost cracked at 0:33, after \"I'm gonna say smoothie.\" permalink parent award report block reply HunterBidensPC 13 points 3 days ago \u201cMy ideal man would drink a smoothie\u201d This woman is a fag permalink parent award report block reply monkadelic 11 points 3 days ago Thats a protein shake!!!!

I either have a bot assigned to me, or people here have too much of a mob mentality, which is likely true.

Then pay SHIT-TONS of $$$$ in her 40s to try to have a baby, but the previous abortionS will have already defeated that. permalink parent award report block reply sanitaryshaver 49 points 3 days ago All that for a 3.

It's easy to get caught when it's a cute face picture, but one of them literally could barely fit in her own car... permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 1 points 3 days ago The Era of Snapchat Filter Feminism. Yup. That filter use shows you beyond the shadow of ANY doubt how PATENTLY DISHONEST the majority of women actually are. permalink parent award report block reply user2827 1 points 3 days ago What are you talking about; lying about her face with makeup, her boobs with padding, her legs with tights, hair color, height, and weight... but expects an honest man. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 1 points 3 days ago Female social norms affirm that every woman is a 10. You are not wrong.

SHE will pick and choose and he will obey while he \"leads\". permalink parent award report block reply ThorsonTT 4 points 3 days ago Be a Christian = you must be moral and faithful.  Me, not so much. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 1 points 3 days ago She basically means a Cultural Christian. Keeps the trimmings of Christianity and the cultural aspect but doesn't care for the morals and the demanding nature of what it expects. Technically, these make up a good 80% of all Christians tbh, so it will actually be easier to find him. permalink parent award report block reply Mortal_Wombat 15 points 3 days ago 3?

Fuck them. permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 5 points 3 days ago You just describe a shit-ton of women today. And men. Good ones are out there and worth the search. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 1 points 3 days ago A lot of men today are not worth a flip from women's perspective, because they have walked away. They don't care about any of you any longer. We don't need to advertise it... we just act polite and move on. Sex? Ok. Otherwise, yeah, uh, nah. I fit that description, except sex really isn't even on the table any more. Do some research: Women are filthy disease factories. I'm not interested in getting oral or penial cancer just to get with any of you. That's not even touching on HIV/AIDS, Herpes, etc. Now some STDs are becoming untreatable. Use your vibrator and fuck machine. More and more men are even waking up to sex, because: What you offer is not longer worth it. permalink parent award report block reply view 9 more comments... load 2 more comments...

She looks more like she has the physique of an ACTUAL rat standing on its hind legs. In fact, compare her shoulders with the shoulders of the interviewer; the interview looks like SHE'S in good shape. And we see that she definitely has a job too.

She is, and she started voicing this reality at least a few years ago, and she is not the only matchmaker to do so. Women today are beyond ridiculous.

I call people back same day, I have great communication, I arrive... and magically, I arrive on time. I get people legitimately calling me \"Sir\", and genuinely thanking me for calling them back, showing up, showing up on time, great work, etc. I don't negotiate. They take my price or leave it. I don't care. When people start making it \"too complicated/difficult\" I cut them loose. They NEVER turn out to be worth the aggravation, time, effort, etc. MOST of the people that seem to have genuine problems with pricing seem to be people in their 80s or older. They grew up when people worked for $5/WEEK and once they get over the line they just can't seem to keep up, IME. Not all. Not even most, IME.

I have done group exercise stuff in the past. For a long time actually. Those always seem to devolve into being more about drinking beer afterwards than the actual workout itself. On the other hand I\u2019ve been lifting weights in my basement since March. I just looked this up yesterday and I\u2019m at 237 workouts in 247 days, or 96%.
