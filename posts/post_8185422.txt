The US government spent the last 25 years trying to get rid of Assad. Syria was literally one of the countries that George W Bush and Dick Cheney wanted to invade, but never got around to because Iraq became such a clusterfuck. Of course they are happy now that he's gone.

The issue is that a lot don't want to stop in a Muslim country when there are dumb Western countries willing to give them free money. permalink parent award report block reply GeneticsGuy 9 points 2 hours ago Maybe guys it is better for us to be promoting peace than complaining about past affiliations. Ya, it sucks, but the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were wars we didn't need to be in. Fun fact, the Taliban were actually going to hand over Bin Laden in 2001, and they told Bush that they would have him in US custody within 24hrs. The US said they'd give them 24hrs... and then the Taliban were getting ready to bring Bin Laden in... once Bush Jr. saw that, they realized they weren't going to get their war, so they bombed Afghanistan early, before the 24hrs was up, kickstarting the war. The Taliban then said, "Well nevermind, screw you guys, war it is." Never forget, the Taliban were literally our ALLIES in the 80s against Russia's occupation of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was a completely separate faction that regularly clashed with the Taliban. Not justifying the Taliban in any way, but I am pointing out how in 2001, we had off-ramps to NOT going to war there. The Taliban wanted to cooperate with the US, but Bush and the neocons REALLY wanted their war, which they got. Taliban cooperation went against the narrative. This guy wants peace in Syria. Let them have it. Ya, it sucks. Ya, they prosecute Christians. BUT IT'S NOT OUR WAR. We want peace, and we are getting peace. One of the things that is helping us get peace in the Middle-East is by letting them go and govern their own countries. Ya, Iran is a bad actor because they want to destroy the world, same with Palestinians, but Hamas only exists because of Iran. The rest of the Middle-East knows this. The rest of the Middle-East wants to live in peace with the world. Let's let them. North Korea's dictator is a terrible evil dude, way more so than this dude ever could dream of being,  so is it smarter to just keep isolating North Korea, or was Trump justified in trying to broker negotiations and peace with North Korea instead of just banging your chest like neocons are about how war is great? Let peace be peace. Let Syria do it's own thing. Let's try to bring North Korea into the normalized world instead of just being an agent of China. This isn't a bad thing. permalink award report block reply B-2StealthTrump 5 points 2 hours ago You make a fair point. permalink parent award report block reply Throwingway22 8 points 3 hours ago "you'll need this with all the curried, street shitters you're bringing in who you just declared as better than Americans." permalink award report block reply South_Florida_Guy 6 points 3 hours ago Bro even dressed like Trump for the meeting permalink award report block reply CanadianMeathead 5 points 3 hours ago I don't love him permalink award report block reply Ocineaa 4 points 2 hours ago What happened to Trump.

GeneticsGuy 9 points 2 hours ago Maybe guys it is better for us to be promoting peace than complaining about past affiliations. Ya, it sucks, but the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were wars we didn't need to be in. Fun fact, the Taliban were actually going to hand over Bin Laden in 2001, and they told Bush that they would have him in US custody within 24hrs. The US said they'd give them 24hrs... and then the Taliban were getting ready to bring Bin Laden in... once Bush Jr. saw that, they realized they weren't going to get their war, so they bombed Afghanistan early, before the 24hrs was up, kickstarting the war. The Taliban then said, "Well nevermind, screw you guys, war it is." Never forget, the Taliban were literally our ALLIES in the 80s against Russia's occupation of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was a completely separate faction that regularly clashed with the Taliban. Not justifying the Taliban in any way, but I am pointing out how in 2001, we had off-ramps to NOT going to war there. The Taliban wanted to cooperate with the US, but Bush and the neocons REALLY wanted their war, which they got. Taliban cooperation went against the narrative. This guy wants peace in Syria. Let them have it. Ya, it sucks. Ya, they prosecute Christians. BUT IT'S NOT OUR WAR. We want peace, and we are getting peace. One of the things that is helping us get peace in the Middle-East is by letting them go and govern their own countries. Ya, Iran is a bad actor because they want to destroy the world, same with Palestinians, but Hamas only exists because of Iran. The rest of the Middle-East knows this. The rest of the Middle-East wants to live in peace with the world. Let's let them. North Korea's dictator is a terrible evil dude, way more so than this dude ever could dream of being,  so is it smarter to just keep isolating North Korea, or was Trump justified in trying to broker negotiations and peace with North Korea instead of just banging your chest like neocons are about how war is great? Let peace be peace. Let Syria do it's own thing. Let's try to bring North Korea into the normalized world instead of just being an agent of China. This isn't a bad thing. permalink award report block reply B-2StealthTrump 5 points 2 hours ago You make a fair point. permalink parent award report block reply
