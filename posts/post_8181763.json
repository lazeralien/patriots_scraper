How about the pharma companies who have shit loads of money to fund this research but they won\u2019t. So, the system is designed for you to pay with your tax dollars liberal researchers to come up with something that they sell to a pharma company that makes it and sells it back to you for 10000% markup. permalink award report block reply XxxRDTPRNxxX 74 points 2 days ago Worse, what about the ones that have cures to diseases already discovered but don't bring them to market because it's more profitable sell a treatment? You know they're there. Is there any law requiring them to bring shit like that to market? There are definitely laws saying they have to act in the best interest of shareholders and if they don't the CEO can be personally liable for losses. permalink parent award report block reply Cuetardian 33 points 2 days ago and their argument would be that \"selling the treatment over and over and over makes tons of money and THAT is in the best interest of the shareholders.\" Monsters. permalink parent award report block reply ModernKnight 18 points 2 days ago The real cure for breast cancer is actually having kids before 25.  Breast cancer used to be called \"Nun's disease,\" because almost all the people who got it were nuns.  I think the age when women become more at risk for breast cancer is somewhere around 23, with each further year a woman goes without giving birth doubling her chance of breast cancer.  It has to do with how womens' bodies develop, with the breasts only fully developing when she has a kid and breast feeds that kid finishing development, and not doing so causing problems. permalink parent award report block reply America1stAndOnly 5 points 1 day ago But if they do that they won't be able to get abortions and perform their child sacrifices to moloch. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I wish people would stop parroting this absolutely neanderthal statement. You know how much those cures cost? Absolutely astronomical amounts of money. Not to pharma, to you. And you end up paying it. Why? Because you have no other options. You know what's cheaper? Chemo, radiation, and removal. You know what insurance covers first ? You guessed it! Some of you will be cured, many will die = less money insurance has to dish out. Pharma absolutely profits on cures and absolutely makes them. A lot of the mabs out there will cure, and will also cost you $10k/month without insurance minimum . It's like playing whack-a-mole with all the diseases out there.

Where did I say that they never cure any diseases? Where did I say that? I didn't. I said there are some diseases they won't cure due to making more money on treatments. Are you gonna refute that?

That would be a treatment, of the kind that makes them rich, but doesn't actually cure you. Exactly the kind of thing people are talking about. By definition, there is no \"cure\". Unless you're getting down to the microscopic level and analyzing every cell, you will never be able to determine if the problem is completely gone. No more cancerous cells? What if a gene disorder caused it in the first place? So people will be in \"remission\" for 10, 20, 30 years. Could it still come back? Sure. Is it going to? Likelihood drops with every year. At this point it's a war on language. Pragmatically, many are \"cured\" and will never experience cancer again. Why release a $10 cure, when they can charge $10k a month for a 'treatment' that merely slows your death down a bit? That's the profit motive people are talking about. Probably because of the astronomical amounts of money that goes into it. You're not just mixing chemicals in a vat, you're genetically modifying a cell to produce antibodies.  You can't even make generics of existing monoclonal antibodies - you can only make \"similar\" (biosimilar) drugs as it's impossible to make an exact copy. Our glove budget is more than my salary.

If the target is bound, release of a cytotoxic payload is triggered. If there is no target, the payload remains inert and the particles are excreted unchanged. My PhD work mainly focused on the design and synthesis of novel biocompatible nanomaterials for transfection-free intracellular gene knockdown. permalink parent award report block reply view 15 more comments...

We should invent cloning and memory transfer. Hey, I have cancer, but here is a fresh body, now transfer over my memory to the new body. Obviously only the rich or super important should have access to this. But, any day I could find cancer in my ass, and it's just a roll of the dice. Long life is pointless. We used to live to 30 or 40 and we were more productive as a human race. Families made like 12 children and they worked in coal mines and shit. School went to 12 years if you were lucky. We have it far too good today and none of us deserve it. A man who has everything is weak as fuck. The struggle makes us real.

Deplora 46 points 2 days ago She says her work has potential to prevent (not cure) breast cancer.  I can't be bothered to watch this, but \"breast cancer\" is a whole bunch of different types of cancer, with different developmental pathways and different sensitivity/resistance to various treatments.  Nobody has \" the cure for breast cancer\" or even \" the prevention for breast cancer\", and nobody ever will.  Most preventive measures that are already proven to be highly effective involve lifestyle changes and self-discipline that most women are unwilling to adhere to (no alcohol use, no getting significantly overweight). There are many thousands of biomedical researchers who are hoping that their idea will prove to be very significant for treating or preventing some common life-shortening or disabling disease.  They can't all be given all the money they want to try to prove their idea actually works.  In most cases, their idea will turn out not to work, or to work a little bit but less effectively than somebody else's idea. permalink award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 48 points 2 days ago PhD scientist here working in cancer research.

Preventing Breast CA would be huge. But which type? Are we talking BRCA+, ER+, HER+?, the negative versions of these, which get rarer but harder to treat? Details matter when you're making sensationalist claims to a urinalist/activist about a disease which threatens 1 in 8 women and terrifies them all. Meanwhile I'm also reading another author on that paper is saying he did the lion's share of the work and she's trying to claim credit for the breakthrough, if there is one... I already know this is getting politicized and turned into a circus, so I can't listen to either one. I'll have to read the paper myself and see what's up. But yeah, from here, I'm smelling ivory-tower vegan farts with a hint of cat piss and wine breath. Edit: Found the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01988-0 She's got a copy number alteration that seems to correlate with BRCA1+ or BRCA2+ status. Maybe a biomarker? Maybe useful as a screening tool? We already have BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening tests, so is her thought to use this in lieu of mammograms in high-risk women in their 20s and 30s to try and catch early onset cancer? (This isn't prevention, it's screening) permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 8 points 2 days ago There are a lot of academics whose whole career is just questionable contributions to science funded by lavish grants of millions of dollars, just because they made flashy presentations for granting agencies, published papers in prestigious journals, etc. The core of the \"red wine is good for you\" theory came from the compound resveratrol, which is a natural polyphenol present in wine. It was supposed to be cardioprotective or some shit like that, but anyway the professor (Dipak Das) was found to have faked HIS WHOLE CAREER worth of papers, and he wrote a lengthy rambling rebuttal after he was fired and then died unceremoniously of a heart attack.

It seems to be a modest increase, which I was unaware of. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295577/ Seems like 4-8% per 10mL alcohol consumed per day (which I assume they're equating to 100% alcohol? A 40mL shot is roughly 10mL of alcohol, equal to one \"unit\".) But keep in mind that the average incidence is 46.3 per 100,000.  So we're talking somewhere in the realm of 2-4 more than that. It's...an association, but a little weak. With as old as alcohol is in society, I'd think that there was something else at play here. Alcohol does have hormonal activity a la estrogen, so I think it probably modifies something where those predisposed to breast cancer get a boost in their ability to develop cancer. Otherwise, we'd see much higher rates in Poland than we would in the US, but the opposite is true. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora 2 points 1 day ago Several studies have found a very strong effect, especially with binge drinking in early adulthood (i.e. drinking that's considered \"normal\" on many college campuses).

Stopped the sundowning cold for a year, and when started up again, increased dose by 50%, and stopped again.

This is the paper she published referring to this breakthrough: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01988-0 She's saying that she found a fairly easily detectable pattern in BRCA1+ and BRCA2+ individuals that appears before some of the traditional mutations manifest. This is what's called a biomarker. You can build a test for these things and use the test to screen at-risk patients. The catch is that she's developed no actual test, nor has she done the clinical work to validate her method of screening in real patients. This is really important because we need to know if the test results mean anything. Do they predict that a person is going to develop the disease? If so, how often? If a person tests positive and half the time, nothing happens, it's a terrible test. That has to be studied. She's a long way out from that. She's doing hypothesis generating research and trying to act like she's on the verge of launching a meaningful screening test. Even then, that's not preventing breast cancer. That's early detection of something that's already there in patients where we already know are high risk. It's not nothing, but it's a hell of a lot less than this lady and the propagandist are trying to insinuate. permalink award report block reply Ligersrule1 1 points 2 days ago Another RMNA \"vaccine\"?

That would be a treatment, of the kind that makes them rich, but doesn't actually cure you. Exactly the kind of thing people are talking about. By definition, there is no \"cure\". Unless you're getting down to the microscopic level and analyzing every cell, you will never be able to determine if the problem is completely gone. No more cancerous cells? What if a gene disorder caused it in the first place? So people will be in \"remission\" for 10, 20, 30 years. Could it still come back? Sure. Is it going to? Likelihood drops with every year. At this point it's a war on language. Pragmatically, many are \"cured\" and will never experience cancer again. Why release a $10 cure, when they can charge $10k a month for a 'treatment' that merely slows your death down a bit? That's the profit motive people are talking about. Probably because of the astronomical amounts of money that goes into it. You're not just mixing chemicals in a vat, you're genetically modifying a cell to produce antibodies.

Breast cancer used to be called \"Nun's disease,\" because almost all the people who got it were nuns.  I think the age when women become more at risk for breast cancer is somewhere around 23, with each further year a woman goes without giving birth doubling her chance of breast cancer.  It has to do with how womens' bodies develop, with the breasts only fully developing when she has a kid and breast feeds that kid finishing development, and not doing so causing problems. permalink parent award report block reply America1stAndOnly 5 points 1 day ago But if they do that they won't be able to get abortions and perform their child sacrifices to moloch. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

We should invent cloning and memory transfer. Hey, I have cancer, but here is a fresh body, now transfer over my memory to the new body. Obviously only the rich or super important should have access to this. But, any day I could find cancer in my ass, and it's just a roll of the dice. Long life is pointless. We used to live to 30 or 40 and we were more productive as a human race. Families made like 12 children and they worked in coal mines and shit. School went to 12 years if you were lucky.

I can't be bothered to watch this, but \"breast cancer\" is a whole bunch of different types of cancer, with different developmental pathways and different sensitivity/resistance to various treatments.  Nobody has \" the cure for breast cancer\" or even \" the prevention for breast cancer\", and nobody ever will.  Most preventive measures that are already proven to be highly effective involve lifestyle changes and self-discipline that most women are unwilling to adhere to (no alcohol use, no getting significantly overweight). There are many thousands of biomedical researchers who are hoping that their idea will prove to be very significant for treating or preventing some common life-shortening or disabling disease.  They can't all be given all the money they want to try to prove their idea actually works.  In most cases, their idea will turn out not to work, or to work a little bit but less effectively than somebody else's idea. permalink award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 48 points 2 days ago PhD scientist here working in cancer research.

Several components of these oils have estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects, and can cause breast growth in young boys.  Presumably there are some other potentially undesirable effects that are less visible/detectable. https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2018/chemicals-in-lavender-and-tea-tree-oil-appear-to-be-hormone-disruptors permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 3 points 1 day ago Colon cancer, too. permalink parent award report block reply TPMJB 2 points 1 day ago highly effective Eh, it depends on the amount per day. It seems to be a modest increase, which I was unaware of. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7295577/ Seems like 4-8% per 10mL alcohol consumed per day (which I assume they're equating to 100% alcohol? A 40mL shot is roughly 10mL of alcohol, equal to one \"unit\".) But keep in mind that the average incidence is 46.3 per 100,000.  So we're talking somewhere in the realm of 2-4 more than that. It's...an association, but a little weak. With as old as alcohol is in society, I'd think that there was something else at play here. Alcohol does have hormonal activity a la estrogen, so I think it probably modifies something where those predisposed to breast cancer get a boost in their ability to develop cancer. Otherwise, we'd see much higher rates in Poland than we would in the US, but the opposite is true. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora 2 points 1 day ago Several studies have found a very strong effect, especially with binge drinking in early adulthood (i.e. drinking that's considered \"normal\" on many college campuses).

People just don't want to.  Few if any topical beauty/skincare products are doing to increase cancer risk.

I was a 24/7 caregiver for my mother for 3 years. And I mean 24 and 7, while I ran a small software company by myself at home. About 5 PM each day she started walking out the front door (at age 83) to take a bus (no bus in our suburban neighborhood) to \"see her mother\". Damn annoying while I was cooking dinner. Heard on a doctor's radio show about Folic acid, so I tried it. One daily vitamin tablet at each meal time and bedtime, total 4 tablets per day. Stopped the sundowning cold for a year, and when started up again, increased dose by 50%, and stopped again. Search for folic acid/sundowning/Alzheimer's and look for current research about folic acid deficiency.

In the odd future we can regenerate brain tissue, it'll never have the data of the old brain tissue. The only potential pathway we have is to stop it before it gets worse.

This is the paper she published referring to this breakthrough: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01988-0 She's saying that she found a fairly easily detectable pattern in BRCA1+ and BRCA2+ individuals that appears before some of the traditional mutations manifest. This is what's called a biomarker. You can build a test for these things and use the test to screen at-risk patients. The catch is that she's developed no actual test, nor has she done the clinical work to validate her method of screening in real patients. This is really important because we need to know if the test results mean anything. Do they predict that a person is going to develop the disease? If so, how often? If a person tests positive and half the time, nothing happens, it's a terrible test. That has to be studied. She's a long way out from that. She's doing hypothesis generating research and trying to act like she's on the verge of launching a meaningful screening test. Even then, that's not preventing breast cancer. That's early detection of something that's already there in patients where we already know are high risk.
