I remember the first time I heard of this a guy at work bought a new motorcycle. I asked how much it cost and he told me his monthly payment. I said nobody cares how much you pay a month, how much is the total. He said he didn't care. Says he walked in and told the salesman he would buy it if he got his payments to a certain number. Ridiculously retarded.

It's not the overinflated cost of the cookie cutter disposable house mass produced by illegals in 30 days that's the problem, you're just too poor! Walk right into the bank, smack your $400,000 on the table in cash and say "1 house sir" with a firm handshake and a smile. That's how you win, son. permalink parent award report block reply redinmn 1 points 3 days ago I agree with you.   If I can get a 10 year loan for $1000 a month or a 30 year loan for $500 a month, I would take the 30 year $500 / month loan, pay $1000 and then if something happened where I needed a bit of extra cash, I would have the $500 difference available to me.    I sign up for 30% credit cards to get the bonuses, then either pay off in full or over an extremely limited time frame.  The loan company tends to make less than if they just offered me a lower rate to begin with.  They are the suckers I take advantage of whenever possible.   Just built a nice 28x28 garage myself for $21,000 on 0% credit cards for 18 months and got nearly 10% of the garage cost back in rebates and cash back.   It will be paid off before any interest is paid. permalink parent award report block reply Neversurrender123 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply
