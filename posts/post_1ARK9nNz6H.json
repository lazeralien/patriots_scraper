Almost anything could be in there that would be a huge imposition on any 'law abiding citizen'. Like 'you are not allowed to access the internet' and if you borrow someone's phone to call the police after an accident you just violated probation. At a minimum, you have to report a lot about your life to your probation officer - you literally have to live your life under the glare of a state appointed nanny.

The MSM-DNC-IC complex wanted to make sure that NO critical mass of MAGA folks ever happens again like on J6. That\u2019s why they painted it as the worst thing since 9/11. I protested and ultimately got the FBI crawling up my ass and digging into my personal life looking for crimes (sound familiar?) but until we have a critical mass of people willing to risk their safety or freedom for what\u2019s right, the necessary change will not occur permalink parent award report block reply SavingPrivateGrace 19 points 6 hours ago One man is going to prove that no crime was committed by him on Jan 6th and rewrite the historical event.

So far, from this administration, another goose egg.

Trump is the President.  He should accept the pardon and protection from political persecution.  Accepting it does nothing to absolve the sins of the state. permalink award report block reply ActNow 1 points 5 hours ago He stands out by rejecting the pardon.

Taking it doesn\u2019t mean he still can\u2019t pressure Congress to investigate the court.

He is one of those fags who have turned on Trump and is going to say Trump was the #1 big bad the whole time. Some of those J6ers are nutjobs who never ever supported Trump and were just there to chimp out because Q told them to do so. I am going to laugh at his faggoty ass when he fails and then because he rescinded the pardon and if they accept the rescission he is fucking his family even moreso because he hates Trump \ud83e\udd23. These faggots want an excuse to chimp out and rage against Trump. permalink parent award report block reply yeptheguy 37 points 6 hours ago His sentence was completed before the pardon. All it does is remove his probation, which does nothing to normal law abiding citizens. He is fighting the system which allowed this persecution to happen in the first place. Read the article faggot. permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 1 points 1 hour ago All it does is remove his probation, which does nothing to normal law abiding citizens. that heavily depends on the terms of his probation. Almost anything could be in there that would be a huge imposition on any 'law abiding citizen'. Like 'you are not allowed to access the internet' and if you borrow someone's phone to call the police after an accident you just violated probation. At a minimum, you have to report a lot about your life to your probation officer - you literally have to live your life under the glare of a state appointed nanny.
