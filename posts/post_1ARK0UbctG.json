The only thing Republicans do in power is slow down Democrats. They don't fight back and play dirty like Democrats do, which is partly why Democrats won yesterday's Governor elections. Edit: Especially when all those ICE protest videos show the protesters yelling, honking their car horns, and throwing rocks at ICE agents, with no pushback from ICE agents, that was motivation for Democrats to think they were 'winning'. permalink parent award report block reply leakmouth 45 points 7 days ago we don\u2019t even need to play dirty.

It was a brutal wakeup call last night. permalink parent award report block reply Badfinz_FL 40 points 7 days ago in the upcomign midterms ALL house seats are up for re-election and a majority of the senate as well This is a much bigger election as it deals with districts and states.  The senate races could get interesting but the house races will fall along their historic district norms.  That favors us. If we don't fix the voting shit in this country, or we fail to play the ballot stuffing game like the demo commies, we are in for an interesting midterm election especially in the senate races as they are more a statewide type election versus districts only. permalink parent award report block reply ParmesanCartel 5 points 7 days ago Unfortunately trump has fucked any chance the Republicans had for the midterms. His Israel first bullshit and his avoidance even backtracking on his promises really soured most trump supporters I know. permalink parent award report block reply NonbinaryPotatohead 3 points 6 days ago more importantly the young voter base.

It\u2019s about the margins. Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey by 5 points. The Democrat gubernatorial candidates won both by 15 points. Moreover, both of these are states that have elected Republican governors in the recent past, so they\u2019re not deep blue states like you make them out to be. The results bode poorly for Republican prospects in more consequential elections next year. permalink parent award report block reply couranto 7 points 7 days ago Wrong.

Retards. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 6 points 7 days ago It still takes 67 senators to remove after impeachment and that only makes Vance president if they somehow get 67 votes. As much as we would like to pretend the GOP would win Virginia, most of us knew it probably wasn\u2019t going to flip only a year after all statewide races in Virginia went to Dems, especially since a number of people hit by mass firings and the shutdown were from NOVA. Few people here seemed to notice VA still went blue last year because Trump didn\u2019t need them to pass 270 and Hung Cao lost to a two-term incumbent in a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002. Youngkin was in the right place at the right time with his opponent\u2019s controversies and with Loudoun County in the news for trying to cover up the same boy raping two girls in two different schools because he wore a dress when he did it. permalink parent award report block reply covok48 1 points 7 days ago Right but you didn\u2019t mention the AG\u2026for a reason. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 6 points 7 days ago We warned them.

We all know Zionists have trumps ears and we just watched their two biggest right wing gate keepers crash out the week before the election. Then there\u2019s the group chat leaks and the secret recordings all done by Jews to purge anyone who isn\u2019t bowing down to them. It\u2019s fundamentally clear they\u2019d sooner communist America than America without Israel. Also, it\u2019s finally clicking in a lot of people\u2019s minds that minorities will never ever vote red and will usher in communism. So a lot of peoples world view of if we\u2019re nice to them they\u2019ll be nice to us has been shattered. permalink parent award report block reply Seeker_17 -6 points 7 days ago Zionists? LOL.

Are you not aware of the avalanche of the young to middle age voter base, you know, the majority of voters, that are extremely dissatisfied with how blatant Israel has been with their takeover and foreign influence recently? LOL You can watch Bibi cream his pants talking to the 7k per post influencers about his \"Esther Project\" or Trump himself admitting Miriam Adelson OWNS him and dictates his policy. That is NOT what I nor anyone else voted for. Zionist influence is the HOTTEST topic across the political sphere currently. If you don't know that, it's because you aren't using apps or seeing the content that the MAJORITY voter base is, which makes your opinion irrelevant by definition. permalink parent award report block reply eclectic22 6 points 7 days ago It's a disappointment for sure and a wake up call. No place for complacency now. permalink parent award report block reply Badfinz_FL 11 points 7 days ago the polls have been showing for months neither republican candidate in those states had a chance.

Then fight by running for office and hope you don't get shot in the process. permalink parent award report block reply Nat4Pat 9 points 7 days ago You know what I like about the jews? They unify, even rushing to defend one of their own pedophiles. They also have this network where none of them have trouble finding a partner or job through family and friends. So no one is left behind as a race. That's why they can dominate this civilization with less than 2% population. Organizing is definitely the most important ability as modern social unit. And that is the untapped potential for this race to exploit. permalink parent award report block reply Bigstick7 9 points 7 days ago White people are basically the only ones who aren't tribal. Every other race in general is. permalink parent award report block reply Nat4Pat 3 points 7 days ago Seems someone needs to change and I don't expect it to be the other side. permalink parent award report block reply -Evspra 3 points 7 days ago i commented something similar a while back. it's genuinely amazing how jews have been able to stick together for THOUSANDS of years like fucking glue, yet we can barely stand one another and would never willingly go out of our way for a random white person on the street. indians are similar in this regard. you hire one indian at an american company and if they get a managerial position, you'll almost never see anyone other than indians getting hired after that. permalink parent award report block reply Nat4Pat 3 points 7 days ago The conquest of the world has put us in a secured and wealthy state that deprived us of survival instinct.

Few people here seemed to notice VA still went blue last year because Trump didn\u2019t need them to pass 270 and Hung Cao lost to a two-term incumbent in a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002.

Or hell maybe give the finger to Ukraine and Israel? do something... anything to put America 1st as the damn president of the USA Or stop edging on new wars no one wants? Or stop using tariffs as a response to people that piss you off (Canada runs ad = tariff?) or to the benefit of globohomo (tariff india to help Ukraine?) to the point where SCOTUS might actually rule 9-0 to send that emergency power back to congress? Or stop saying the Epstein list and files are a democrat Hoax when all your people pre election said it would be epic? Or don't ignore the grocery prices and brag they are down when we all have eyes and aren't seeing much change at the stores. and double stupid to do that while building an expansion to WH to host balls and Gatsby style feasts... a let them eat cake look. Trump is a masterful marketer but damn if that dude is terrible at filling out a staff. 90% rinos and deepstate. permalink award report block reply\nNonbinaryPotatohead 2 points 6 days ago \"2 more weeks\" Trump stop appointing retards to key positions!

Really? Then what is the general consensus on the lead up to the beginning as stated by Trump now? It feels a little drag assey and falling way short of the basic expectations of a revolution. Seems like its all being orchestrated to have just enough punch and kick to keep real fighters and patriots from taking control of the movement. Seems like the GOP is still full of flacid geriatric fucks that are too weak to fight Radicals, Leftists and Globalist Commies and the  Patriot/Q movement is filled more with 'by the book/follow the plan' Religious Zealots, Boomer Peaceniks, and Low T Hero Worshipers than actual fighters and revolutionaries. permalink award report block reply\ngp7373 1 points 7 days ago \"Our fight has only just begun, again...again....... permalink award report block reply\nCovfefebrulee 1 points 6 days ago JUST ENFORCE THE EXISTING LAWS FFS! permalink award report block reply\nOpi33 1 points 7 days ago Meh. permalink award report block reply\nLynnforthetruth 1 points 7 days ago Hello world\nCan someone please create a spray bottle of pigs blood that Women and girls can carry for protection permalink award report block reply\nbirb_never_dies 1 points 7 days ago He would sound better if he said that without a Jew cock in his mouth ... permalink award report block reply\nDoubleu1992 0 points 7 days ago Cool but we still lose midterms permalink award report block reply\njosiborg 0 points 7 days ago Quit being a pussy.
