The problem is that they weasel their way into the positions of power when things are good and normal and, for some fucking reason, stronger men than they are then take them seriously. Look at the cops that we know will simply follow the orders to arrest or even kill regular citizens. The average cop could break the average commie bitch in half, but they'll still take orders from them. The most important lesson for humanity, that we keep learning the hard way and then forgetting as soon as things get easy, is that you never let weak bitches get into positions of power or authority. But all we have now is weak bitches in control. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Even the East German Stasi was well known to be full of gays. They actually recruited the gays by threatening to out them if they didn't work for the Stasi and they rewarded their loyal gays with hedonism.

It's always been satanic. It took the idea of Jesus telling you to care for others. And twisted it into a scheme to get plebs to destroy the government with the enteral carrot on the stick (\"we just haven't gotten there yet, looks like the government will just have to keep unlimited control until everyone is equal\"). And then once they displace the government the elite locus come in, take over and steal everything and starve the people to death. It's goal was always to deceive.

Both are \"oppossed\" to the other  but in reality both centralize control in the hands of unelected technocrats. Communism is used to suppress and destroy and \"free markets\" are used to extract and divide. There is an alternative - the American System as developed by Alexander Hamilton, used by Lincoln, McKinley and now Trump (he is trying to get it started again). Communism was funded and supported by the same people that developed the \"free-trade\" system. They are the same system.

During the hight of Covid someone observed the behavior of some of our population and made a diagnosis of \" Mass _ ? psychosis .  That diagnosis sent the powers that be, and people with TDS, into a tizzy, and it got memory-holed. Feb 26, 2021 \u2014 A mass psychosis is an epidemic of madness, and it occurs when a large portion of a society loses touch with reality and descends into delusions. While I was searching for the middle word in that diagnosis, look at what I found over on PubMed Central (PMC) in just a few minutes - but I never found the middle word - does anyone remember the exact term?
