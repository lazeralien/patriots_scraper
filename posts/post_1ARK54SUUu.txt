When the female population is generally chubby they push women to be obese, like now.  This is because extremely skinny or obese women are not desired by most men and can rarely carry a healthy child to term. It's all about mate supression. Remember, it's Women who push these standards.  All guys want is a slightly chubby young woman wearing anything or nothing. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 5 days ago Her pants look like a trash bag stuffed with discarded pig intestines. permalink award report block reply Weneverleft 1 points 5 days ago Ahem,  I thought we were doing something about cow farts??? permalink award report block reply
