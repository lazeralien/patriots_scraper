I went to the ks attorney general website and it said the same thing.  You could sign an affidavit allowing you to vote without providing any documents to verify who you are.

It is going to come down to this in the coming days- the democratic party (Immigrants, foreigners, minorities) wrestling with Republicans (traditional American Citizens) for control of the federal government. Its...... not a great path for us to be on and has some very clearly possible destinations (civil war being the big one). In short, the democrats are traitors, once again.

He isn\u2019t being charged with false representation for election though, just the voting, from what I understand, so I could be wrong.

It is going to come down to this in the coming days- the democratic party (Immigrants, foreigners, minorities) wrestling with Republicans (traditional American Citizens) for control of the federal government. Its...... not a great path for us to be on and has some very clearly possible destinations (civil war being the big one). In short, the democrats are traitors, once again. The quicker people realize this, accept this, and act accordingly, the less violent the ultimate outcome will be. permalink award report block reply Retard_Strength 2 points 6 days ago Democrat Party 2025: Immigrants, Foreigners, Minorities, Fags & Cat Ladies permalink parent award report block reply\nRetard_Strength 2 points 6 days ago Democrat Party 2025: Immigrants, Foreigners, Minorities, Fags & Cat Ladies permalink parent award report block reply\nDoMagnum 1 points 6 days ago Then to be deported with max drama to rub their nose in it and carve it into their micro-psyche's. permalink award report block reply\nRetardloserimsogay 1 points 6 days ago What did I read? permalink award report block reply\nHunterBidensPC 1 points 6 days ago Illegal to vote but not illegal to be mayor\u2026 Faggot ass retards in charge that all deserve death. permalink award report block reply\nDaemonKrog 1 points 6 days ago Cant vote....but can become mayor.. got it.. nothing's wrong here... permalink award report block reply\ndtrap 1 points 6 days ago So as a non-citizen voting is the problem versus being a candidate, getting elected, and having jurisdiction over a city full of citizens?
