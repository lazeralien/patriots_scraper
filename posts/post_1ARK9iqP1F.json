But the cartels still appreciate her suicidal empathy. permalink parent award report block reply Spicy_cat 6 points 2 days ago An accessory is an accessory permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

As a good liberal she should be fine with that. Something, something\u2026..Each according to their needs.. permalink parent award report block reply Ronaldus 4 points 2 days ago Fixed it for you. \ud83d\ude06 Seize the car, fill it like a clown car full of illegals, and deport it to Mexico so the illegal immigrants will have something to drive. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpYouMagaFrenner 4 points 2 days ago Fill it full of illegals drive into the ocean permalink parent award report block reply WarCry 3 points 2 days ago I hear Elon Musk likes to launch cars into space permalink parent award report block reply Ronaldus 2 points 2 days ago We have a plan upgrade! permalink parent award report block reply SDsc0rch 5 points 2 days ago at some point we should just deport these ppl too lets see how long their little movement holds up after we start deporting them too permalink parent award report block reply load 10 more comments...

She\u2019s marked. There were reporters in the car, it\u2019s best to show their cooperative  spirit and be focused on criminal targets, not like emotional sandboys who gonna show sum bitch who\u2019s boss around here. permalink parent award report block reply IAmDisappoint 36 points 2 days ago Should have arrested that bitch.

Anyone stopping deportations of illegal aliens needs serious jail time. permalink parent award report block reply DarthEP 4 points 2 days ago She's Raising The Next Generation Of Marxist Monsters. permalink parent award report block reply nolefthandshakes 4 points 2 days ago true privilege it seems. above the law even when committing felonies ON VIDEO. fuck this country. this isn\u2019t America at all permalink parent award report block reply hey_spike 24 points 2 days ago They should have delayed her much longer. Make her reconsider her life choices.  Make her miss appointments,  ruin her day. permalink award report block reply ModernKnight 9 points 2 days ago Indeed.  They can hold someone 24 hours without charges, at least hold her for 12.  Just put her in a cell by herself, tell her nothing, then let her out 12 hours later.  She would have absolutely no legal leg to stand on to go after anyone, and there's no chance of some Soros faggot interfering. permalink parent award report block reply edxzxz 10 points 2 days ago Arrest her on a Friday and she'll sit in holding until a Judge can hear her crying bullshit some time on Monday.  I only have the Sheriff serve warrants of execution (against goods and chattels, not actual 'execution') on Fridays for this reason.  Make the fuckers sit all weekend. permalink parent award report block reply anotherrandomname 3 points 2 days ago Plus her car will be sitting in the impound lot racking up fees over the weekend. permalink parent award report block reply Deplorable_in_PA 4 points 2 days ago ICE agents probably had bigger turds to flush and didn't want to bother with some dumbshit TDS boxed wine aunt.  They needed to grab the target, then scoot. permalink parent award report block reply The_Emperor 1 points 2 days ago At least he got her name and plates permalink parent award report block reply Rumpleshitskin 1 points 2 days ago Indeed. Where is the consideration for my kids, who will have to live amongst hers? permalink parent award report block reply Snek_Plissken 22 points 2 days ago This clip doesn't even show all the crazy shit she was doing. She was driving around like she is some sort of entitled crazy person. Swerving around traffic and she nearly hit a school bus. Then they busted her and told her she is going to be federally charged. Now she is just a normal person? permalink award report block reply Nibba2 4 points 2 days ago She didn\u2019t just nearly hit a school bus, she was circling it, so illegal U-turns along with almost hitting the bus. Certainly putting children in bodily danger is enough to get the other cops to pay her a visit but it won\u2019t be. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 3 points 2 days ago School bus drivers are some of the best drivers. If school bus drivers wanted to fuck with assholes using them as cover, they absolutely could. permalink parent award report block reply Wrexxis780 17 points 2 days ago PLZ IM A MOM And shes not with her kids doing crimes.

But this was a televised moment, so they want to look like they are being nice. permalink parent award report block reply airborne3502 14 points 2 days ago I'm for using spotters on a illegal aliens just not in the way she's doing it. permalink award report block reply TiggerLovingPooh 14 points 2 days ago This is the exact problem with the country. ARREST PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE FUCKING LAW. The real downfall of a republic is the failure to enforce the law as written. Why go through all the trouble of voting, legislating, judicial oversight, if the fucking law isn't applied in the first place? permalink award report block reply Formerlurker92 12 points 2 days ago Why is everyone so nice to these cunts permalink award report block reply TiggerLovingPooh 13 points 2 days ago It's the exact reason they are emboldened to be cunts to begin with. permalink parent award report block reply tradcathbugman 11 points 2 days ago Just arrest her and move on if she's causing a problem, she's scared now but in 20 minutes she'll remember that she got away with it, she'll be back pulling this shit, and any of her allies who see this will be emboldened. This officer really seems to me like he's enjoying scaring her too much.  The only time I've seen cops act like this on body cam is when somebody is being a dick to them and there's nothing they can actually do about it. permalink award report block reply BattleOfSaratoga 11 points 2 days ago Look how she sped off.  100% Laughing and thinking to herself, haha stupid fucking pigs my little poor im just a Mom stunt WORKED.  Deputy Field Office Director, DO BETTER. permalink award report block reply RentFree2020 8 points 2 days ago Why aren't they fined or arrested? Cops will yell ticket us if we flash or warn of a friggin speed trap. It could eventually cause harm or death if doing so. How's this acceptable to run around recklessly chasing cops and preventing the deportations of potential criminals and potential future murders, drug overdoses, and rapes? I though we weren't going to fuck around this time? permalink award report block reply magaspif 1 points 2 days ago Feds probably don't have holding facilities and that area is filled with faggot cops. permalink parent award report block reply edxzxz 8 points 2 days ago They should have dragged her out of her car and beaten her mercilessly on the side of the road just for driving a Ford Mustang SUV.  What kind of retard drives a Mustang SUV? permalink award report block reply Tardigrade 5 points 2 days ago OK I laughed. permalink parent award report block reply DarthEP 2 points 2 days ago The Mock-E-Reee!!!! permalink parent award report block reply Bob_sacamanao 7 points 2 days ago What about the ticket for running g a red light? You NEED TO prosecute these liberal deranged democrats! permalink award report block reply lifeisahologram 3 points 2 days ago I don\u2019t think they can issue tickets for that, that\u2019s probably a city or state only enforcement. I think their only leverage is arresting for impediment, obstruction, etc of federal officers. permalink parent award report block reply mygovisacommie 7 points 2 days ago \u201cI\u2019m just a mom.\u201d They why the fuck are you doing this shit? Honestly. If you are just some innocent mother who didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone, then why were you doing it? You knew what you were doing. Should have arrested her. permalink award report block reply lifeisahologram 7 points 2 days ago I find it ironic that a guy who looks and sounds of Hispanic heritage is trying to enforce immigration laws and this White woman with no noticeable foreign sounding accent is trying to help others break them. permalink award report block reply DarthEP 4 points 2 days ago You Noticed. permalink parent award report block reply lifeisahologram 4 points 2 days ago \u201cI\u2019m something of a noticer myself\u201d permalink parent award report block reply Kavantar 6 points 2 days ago \"I'm just a mom\"...

I.C.E may have let her go but we should not. permalink award report block reply CaptainWinston 4 points 2 days ago That fucking Karen should have gone to jail. It would be great for her kids to come visit her on family day, that's how the kids don't turn out like Mom. permalink award report block reply sadierose 4 points 2 days ago at least a ticket for blowing red lights. should have popped her tires permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 4 points 2 days ago The true \"spotters\" are in local PD and ICE. Plenty of people are leaking the exact locations of planned raids so the \"protesters\" can show up before hand, along with the food tables and whistle deliveries, etc. It couldn't be more obvious. The \"protesters\" know a day or more before the raids. permalink award report block reply fuckjbidenok 4 points 2 days ago Zero consequences just emboldens them. This is how we got here in the first place. permalink award report block reply redneckrevival 4 points 2 days ago Should have busted her fucking idiot ass hard!!!! permalink award report block reply MAGAFrogInfinity 4 points 2 days ago How did we get to this point as a society where a \"mom\" is out in public, openly obstructing law enforcement from protecting the mom, her family, and the rest of us? When did good become evil, and evil good? permalink award report block reply worldowedexplanation 1 points 2 days ago Dumb liberal cunts in Chicago are all doing this. Pathetic virtue signaling. permalink parent award report block reply Prandogolio 4 points 2 days ago I'm just a mom! Oh, thirty seconds ago she was an antifascist guerilla freedom fighter, but as soon as there's a possibility of consequences, she wants to pull out the Pussy Pass. Women are insufferable. permalink award report block reply PresidentialPepe 4 points 2 days ago Tone changed real quick. Enjoy prison permalink award report block reply Gletkin 11 points 2 days ago She didn\u2019t even get a ticket. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 2 points 2 days ago Watch the video- He let her go! permalink parent award report block reply PresidentialPepe 3 points 2 days ago That's a shame. Heard him say he's referring her for criminal enforcement twice and kept scrolling. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 2 points 2 days ago You're correct. I missed that yesterday and today. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d permalink parent award report block reply Icepck 4 points 2 days ago Bullshit! Make an example out of her, find out who she works with and go after anybody organizing the crime of impedance. permalink award report block reply Mindcrym 4 points 2 days ago If all liberal women were euthanized,  the Republic would flourish like never before. permalink award report block reply Fangerang 4 points 2 days ago So not only is she attempting to impede ICE operations, but they have her on camera running a red light in pursuit of the ICE vehicles. And they just fucking let her go??? Pathetic. permalink award report block reply Prandogolio 3 points 2 days ago There's no consequences for commies. permalink parent award report block reply Tookens 3 points 2 days ago She is a poster-child for prosecution.  They HAVE to go after people like this. permalink parent award report block reply MissileToad 3 points 2 days ago Wait, what? Why are they just letting her go home?? permalink award report block reply Prandogolio 3 points 2 days ago Of course.   The right is scared of leftists so we let them do whatever they want. permalink parent award report block reply worldowedexplanation 1 points 2 days ago She needs to be doxxed at least permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 3 points 2 days ago She's not \"just a mom.\"  She's also impeding in federal business. permalink award report block reply Badfinz_FL 3 points 2 days ago The spotter will be e arrested permalink award report block reply IdahoMAGAmom 3 points 2 days ago why was her stupid ass not arrested????   keep treating them like toddlers, they'll keep acting like toddlers.  i'm so disgusted. permalink award report block reply hillaryforprison 3 points 2 days ago Oregon.

This is why we are in a civil war. They would arrest us and charge us with 30 federal crimes.  Raid our homes, shoot out dogs, intimidate our family.  Conservatives need to start acting like we are in a state of war. Because we are. permalink award report block reply Spacemonkey 2 points 2 days ago Should have pulled her out of her car and cuffed her ass and taken her to jail.  The only thing the left understands is power and by not arresting her showed that the right refuses to wield the power they have. Democrats understand this that's why they do shit like arresting Trump's lawyers and raiding his wife's panty drawer. Absolutely infuriating how spineless the GOP fucking is. permalink award report block reply conservativefrank 2 points 2 days ago On a Houston conservative radio show, the host called the hotline about the spotting. The prompts were all in Spanish. Host: \"That's interesting given their claim that illegals aren't all from Mexico, are a diverse group of people from all over the world.\" The co-host pointed out that most of the people who call are white women, so that makes it even odder that it's all in Spanish. The instructions these women get for using their whistles to alert about ICE activity are short bursts if ICE is just in the area, \"Twee...tweee...tweee...tweee.\", but a long whistle if ICE is actively \"abducting\" people, \"Tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\". Sounds a lot like \"Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\" to me. permalink award report block reply y_do_i_need_to_hide 2 points 2 days ago No, sister, you are an accessory to a felony. permalink award report block reply Eddie_Vanjovi 2 points 2 days ago Such godless people. permalink award report block reply TexasBrowncoat 2 points 2 days ago It's always the white liberal women....

Never give up your rights for what you perceive as a win for your side. And don't play the officer safety card. If I want to blink my light or stand with a sign 30 yards ahead warning my fellow citizens that a trap is up ahead, yeah, that's my right. permalink award report block reply dres3 1 points 2 days ago Oddball idea.  Make Primary objective be the 'spotters/alerters' and secondary objective being the illegals temporarily within the same operation.  Need the spotters/alerters to be removed as a multiplicative effect. permalink award report block reply MakeAmericaGreat9 1 points 2 days ago Repost from last week. permalink award report block reply Damaged_Dirk 1 points 2 days ago This is not alerting people of a speed trap or a DUI check point. There needs to be a consequence. permalink award report block reply TDAF 1 points 2 days ago She drove away feeling she was victorious in this situation. permalink award report block reply GuidedDisinfo 1 points 2 days ago That agent violated her civil rights because he didn\u2019t treat her the same as he would have treated a man.  He needs to be reprimanded for his blatant bias and directed to arrest even women, regardless of their tears. permalink award report block reply MasterVader2U 1 points 1 day ago Fucking larper gets to tell everyone how she got away. permalink award report block reply PronounParty 1 points 2 days ago Mostly peaceful mother permalink award report block reply Hydris 1 points 2 days ago Pussy, Should have arrested her.

We need to start throwing some of these criminals in prison so they can tell their friends that prison isn't the day spa they think it is permalink award report block reply Than0sIII 1 points 2 days ago Hold them accountable and only the truly insane will keep doing this shit.  And it'll be much easier to deal with them. permalink award report block reply PatriotDawg 1 points 2 days ago A good, hard thrashing with a buggy whip would remove her from any future involvement. Give her more time to be a mom. permalink award report block reply ravonaf 1 points 2 days ago Wow, they let her go. She is just going to do it again. These were the same people chanting \"No one is above the law!\" just a couple of years ago. I guarantee this woman has no regrets. permalink award report block reply worldowedexplanation 1 points 2 days ago Idiots in Chicago are doing this, they hand out whistles so they can warn about ICE. permalink award report block reply bratt 1 points 2 days ago Whistles are also used by antifa in protests.

This is why we are in a civil war. They would arrest us and charge us with 30 federal crimes.  Raid our homes, shoot out dogs, intimidate our family.  Conservatives need to start acting like we are in a state of war. Because we are. permalink award report block reply\nSpacemonkey 2 points 2 days ago Should have pulled her out of her car and cuffed her ass and taken her to jail.  The only thing the left understands is power and by not arresting her showed that the right refuses to wield the power they have. Democrats understand this that's why they do shit like arresting Trump's lawyers and raiding his wife's panty drawer. Absolutely infuriating how spineless the GOP fucking is. permalink award report block reply\nconservativefrank 2 points 2 days ago On a Houston conservative radio show, the host called the hotline about the spotting. The prompts were all in Spanish. Host: \"That's interesting given their claim that illegals aren't all from Mexico, are a diverse group of people from all over the world.\" The co-host pointed out that most of the people who call are white women, so that makes it even odder that it's all in Spanish. The instructions these women get for using their whistles to alert about ICE activity are short bursts if ICE is just in the area, \"Twee...tweee...tweee...tweee.\", but a long whistle if ICE is actively \"abducting\" people, \"Tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\". Sounds a lot like \"Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\" to me. permalink award report block reply\ny_do_i_need_to_hide 2 points 2 days ago No, sister, you are an accessory to a felony. permalink award report block reply\nEddie_Vanjovi 2 points 2 days ago Such godless people. permalink award report block reply\nTexasBrowncoat 2 points 2 days ago It's always the white liberal women....

Never give up your rights for what you perceive as a win for your side. And don't play the officer safety card. If I want to blink my light or stand with a sign 30 yards ahead warning my fellow citizens that a trap is up ahead, yeah, that's my right. permalink award report block reply\ndres3 1 points 2 days ago Oddball idea.  Make Primary objective be the 'spotters/alerters' and secondary objective being the illegals temporarily within the same operation.
