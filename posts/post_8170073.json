Even the states redistricting in our favor is, even though necessary right now to combat their rigging of elections, potential very antithetical to fair and true elections. I saw from family who sent it to me that they did redistricting in Canada for the federal elections late last year right before Trudeau stepped down and guess what happened...their liberals won the federal election again. So it can be a genuine correction or it can be used in a disingenuous way to rig elections like California uses called ballot harvesting to rig their elections permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 28 points 6 days ago I SUSPECTED IT WAS FRAUD.

Illegitimate governor further codifies voter fraud on day one for rigging local, AG and Supreme Court elections. Illegitimate governor appoints district judges. Appointed district judges issues injunction against legitimately elected President. Illegitimate governor shelters illegal aliens for permanent supermajority. Illegitimate governor reelects herself. Illegitimate governor steals House & Senate seats in the general election. Illegitimate senators vote to shut down the government. Illegitimate senators refuse to appoint unfavorable federal judges.

The table is only showing years with a gubernatorial election. For comparison, 2024 had 2.2 million votes for Harris and 1.9 million for Trump. 2021 had a strong incumbent running for governor, so the turnout would be lower than in an open seat year. permalink award report block reply ESAsher 19 points 6 days ago Agreed.  Even if cheating occurred it probably took the form of new biden 'imports' and not more explicit methods.  300,000 is not much in the face of biden's 40-ish million and Jersey is a sanctuary state.  I still want to see some sweeping election integrity reforms though. permalink parent award report block reply Grilledpepe 9 points 6 days ago Saying things like 'the numbers are believable' just excuses obvious fraud.  I'm not making any excuses for these clowns.  Make them prove that many people are actually voting permalink parent award report block reply Kwyjiboy0 4 points 6 days ago What about the open seat years of 2017, 2009, or 2001? All had 2.1-2.3m votes. Then 2025 had 3.2m. 2021 wasn't that strong of an incumbent if 1.25m voted against him. That number of votes would have won half of the other elections, considering total votes really hasn't increased from 1969 to 2017. permalink parent award report block reply RocksCanOnlyWait -1 points 6 days ago Voter turnouts have increased across the board starting in 2020 and peak turnout has remained high for Republicans and Democrats alike. However, Democrat turnout is more consistent, whereas Republican turnout is more varied. Yes, some fraud happens.

The polls of people in NY who think everything sucks but somehow isn't the fault of their own leaders is amazing to see. Orwell's 2 minutes of hate in action, and this is nationwide. The R's have not done nearly what they could since last year. Terrible PR and communication, always nitpicking points that the general public doesn't see or understand. I listened to Ted Cruz and John Kennedy on some podcast last night, Kennedy hawking his book. He means well but you see how these guys are so far removed from everyday people. They pride themselves on lawyerly discussion while the country burns down, and they are all buddies in DC. Congress and Senate should be part-time minimally paid jobs. There should be a way to completely outlaw lobbying, especially of Senators, and repeal the 17th. Congress should not be able to vote anything for themselves, and most of the amenities should be eliminated. Representatives should always only talk to their own individual constituents, and the state level reps. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 3 points 6 days ago There's a reason why they tried that No Kings thing during a government shutdown that they caused so close to an election. We lost the 4D chess idea with the Big Bloated Bill. That shutdown fight should have been over budget cuts at the beginning of Trump's term when he was riding that wave of political capital. Instead, we got Biden Era spending with some MAGA stuff tacked on there. The Senate Parliamentarian that's been there since Harry Reid gutted a lot of that MAGA stuff, and Trump was still demanding it. He demonstrated then that he was afraid of the filibuster and he was going to sacrifice nearly everything to avoid that filibuster. Now you have Democrats pulling the \"Big Ask\" from Trump's playbook with the $1.5T in extra spending. permalink parent award report block reply OTher55 3 points 6 days ago The vote margin last year was Kackler +252,498 The vote margin here is Sherill +414,369 Raw total of votes cast last year is Kawkgobbler 2.2 million vs. Trump 1.9 million Sure the result sucks. But crying fraud at every loss makes you sound like the boy who cried wolf. permalink award report block reply mailinvoter 3 points 6 days ago What if there was a wolf in the Cockgobbler's election results, but you didn't see it and claim it was never there? Is it just a coincidence that every state Trump won has picture voter id? permalink parent award report block reply OTher55 4 points 6 days ago Schrodinger's wolf in the Gobbler's box. Red votes dropped 500k from last year, while Blue votes dropped 400k. That's an enthusiasm to turn out problem. Here's more. In 2020, the vote margin was Braindead +725,061. The margin shrunk almost 500k in 4 years. That's hard evidence and facts. Aren't we supposed to choose facts over feelings? permalink parent award report block reply mailinvoter 1 points 6 days ago So you're not aware of postal workers dumping ballots and election workers claiming to rip up Trump ballots?  I see you mentioned \"votes\" but not \"voters\". You can play the other sides' games and ignore the facts, but I'll just say I hope you don't give that wolf indigestion. permalink parent award report block reply proud_semi_fascist 1 points 6 days ago Hey dummy. You can't compare 2020 to literally anything. They sent a mail in ballot to every registered voter in the state. The fraud was off the charts. You do realize that they register you to vote through DMV, and they allow illegals to get drivers licenses in NJ. So illegals are 100% registered to vote, and are either doing it themselves or having their ballots filled out for them. Sorry if that hurts your feelings. permalink parent award report block reply OTher55 0 points 6 days ago I can't compare 2020 to anything, but you can?

I have jokingly told some guys in the Ocean County GOP that we should do exactly as they do in North Jersey....make every cemetery a GOP voting district. We will have to cheat so bad that it is impossible to ignore. Make 60 Minutes come down here, make Van Jones do a CNN Special Report on Jersey Voter Fraud, make Whoopie issue a tearful plea to end the rampant voter fraud in NJ.....all of it and then say \"we are just following our Democrat brethren in north Jersey, they showed us the way and damn if it doesn't work.\" permalink award report block reply Corse46 3 points 6 days ago Cool, totally irrelevant.

Plot the total votes for every year on a graph and you'll see how absurd this year looks. They're not even done counting yet. When the final mail in and provisionals are counted, the total will be 3.4 million. The number of registered Democrats who voted will likely be higher than the number that voted for Kamala (unaffiliated make up a smaller % of voters in off year NJ elections).

Something very fishy going on at the election station. I casted my REPUBLICAN votes, and each one defaulted to DEMOCRAT! It happened THREE TIMES! My 4th attempt correctly showed my REPUBLICAN votes, but then the machine froze and would not let me print the ballot! Poll workers gathered around the machine, and then phoned someone for help. The workers were told to reboot the machine, which they did, and it happened AGAIN! I had requested that this machine be  noted as \"out of order\",  but it was not done! Therefore, i called the police as i felt this was wrong. Officer arrived and a report was filed. Also, while this was happening, another candidate on the ballot happened to walk in and i informed him of what had transpired.  He made several calls and a commissioner of the Board of Elections arrived. After giving my information, I was asked to leave, as they were going to do an investigation.

And all the State Legislatures or Congress has to do is set the date and provide the necessary funds. No state voter rolls, just a pre-election resident-conducted canvass to locate eligible voters living in their SMALL precinct and to identify voters who need special help.   And then the common sense rules that we all have talked about for years. This way, if there are people incentivized to cheat, they will only taint 2-3 thousand ballots, not the whole State of California or Michigan, or Pennsylvania, or Georgia, NJ, Ohio ...

See if it\u2019s big enough it\u2019s hard to say fraud and no you can\u2019t inspect the ballots either. VA and NJ were both neck and neck until Election Day.

It's not just chain immigration snowballing, it's everything. Old people dying or retiring to Florida, young people turning 18, White people being stupid enough to get jabbed for covid and racemix, small business owners selling and fucking off, indian ownership replacing those small businesses with the freebie loans they get. Blacks having several kids each and spreading out from their inner city hives (and going apeshit over the EBT stuff). Weed getting decriminalized, non-stop construction of new apartment buildings everywhere. The cold war being a distant forgotten memory and geopolitical developments vis a vis Ukraine mean that eastern Europeans, Koreans, Cubans, etc don't reliably lean right wing anymore. It's an above average intelligence state full of 105-115 IQ careerists, and those kinds of people arrogantly fancy themselves \"smart\" and wouldn't be caught dead voting Republican like those stupid \"rednecks\" that maintain their roads and deliver their food to the grocery store. Trump turns off those so-called independents, and if he's not on the ballot then Republicans don't turn out. Jerseyans are kind people but there's an undeniable air of feudal hostility- people don't talk to each other outside of their bubbles, young White people get pretty much no exposure to foundational American ideals. The boys all have broccoli hair, wear gold chains, and talk in negro slang. The ones that don't, fall into other subcultures that lean left-wing. I can personally tell you stories about the dirty looks and treatment I've gotten from other Republicans and Christians, for literally no real reason I can keep going. It's bad. It's really bad. I don't really mind Arabs but Mohammedian headgear is something you see pretty much every time you go outside. My high school hosted fireworks for independence day and it was literally 85%+ brown asians.

And all the State Legislatures or Congress has to do is set the date and provide the necessary funds. No state voter rolls, just a pre-election resident-conducted canvass to locate eligible voters living in their SMALL precinct and to identify voters who need special help.

Over there \u201cRecall Newsome\u201d signs were EVERYWHERE. I LIVE IN A COUMTY WHERE TRUMP LOSES EVERYTIME yet they wanted Nesome out. It was the trial run for the Big Fraud they ran this election. See if it\u2019s big enough it\u2019s hard to say fraud and no you can\u2019t inspect the ballots either. VA and NJ were both neck and neck until Election Day. Then\u2026 but democrats get 57+ % of the vote. BULLSHIT! permalink award report block reply\nGrindelwald 1 points 6 days ago And the computer volume was that much higher going into and out of NYC that day.  Hard to get to the polls in two places in one day, you know? permalink award report block reply\nPillarOfWisdom 1 points 6 days ago That's odd.  Who knew there are consequences to not prosecuting election fraud.  If only we had someone in the White House and Congress to do something about it.  Oh well, maybe next election.  As long as we keep sending money to Israel...that's all that matters. permalink award report block reply\nLLegendary 1 points 6 days ago Well....they haven't done anything to stop the voter fraud..... permalink award report block reply\nMorningFrost 1 points 6 days ago We can expect another steal.

It will be useful in when ranting about it in Fox News interviews. permalink award report block reply\nCommieCrats 1 points 6 days ago Ammo box permalink award report block reply\nWalleye-vision71 0 points 6 days ago Yeah, because New Jersey electing democrats is shocking news! permalink award report block reply\nshogun5000 0 points 6 days ago 2nd term performance is a fucking joke so far permalink award report block reply\ntarballs 0 points 6 days ago Longterm Democrat control from the highest level to the lowest, has created a kind of cascading effect in the dirty Jerz. It's not just chain immigration snowballing, it's everything. Old people dying or retiring to Florida, young people turning 18, White people being stupid enough to get jabbed for covid and racemix, small business owners selling and fucking off, indian ownership replacing those small businesses with the freebie loans they get. Blacks having several kids each and spreading out from their inner city hives (and going apeshit over the EBT stuff). Weed getting decriminalized, non-stop construction of new apartment buildings everywhere. The cold war being a distant forgotten memory and geopolitical developments vis a vis Ukraine mean that eastern Europeans, Koreans, Cubans, etc don't reliably lean right wing anymore. It's an above average intelligence state full of 105-115 IQ careerists, and those kinds of people arrogantly fancy themselves \"smart\" and wouldn't be caught dead voting Republican like those stupid \"rednecks\" that maintain their roads and deliver their food to the grocery store. Trump turns off those so-called independents, and if he's not on the ballot then Republicans don't turn out. Jerseyans are kind people but there's an undeniable air of feudal hostility- people don't talk to each other outside of their bubbles, young White people get pretty much no exposure to foundational American ideals. The boys all have broccoli hair, wear gold chains, and talk in negro slang. The ones that don't, fall into other subcultures that lean left-wing. I can personally tell you stories about the dirty looks and treatment I've gotten from other Republicans and Christians, for literally no real reason I can keep going. It's bad. It's really bad. I don't really mind Arabs but Mohammedian headgear is something you see pretty much every time you go outside. My high school hosted fireworks for independence day and it was literally 85%+ brown asians. This election was supposed to be Ciattarelli's hail mary moment, his 2024, but now I have no idea how the GOP is supposed to win anything without swinging hard left. permalink award report block reply PiratePatriotParrot OP 1 points 6 days ago You got your pulse on everything. \"The boys all have broccoli hair\" > I watch high school get out everyday and it's YEP, every kid with that shit. + ebike permalink parent award report block reply tarballs 1 points 6 days ago It has been said that I'm mentally all over the place.

Bueller??Bueller??? permalink award report block reply\nSchroeder09 -1 points 6 days ago Yeah. The RNC is incompetent and complicit. They should've hired Scott Presley and TPUSA's  get out the vote people years ago. They're not serious. They're just there to launder money and basically live off donations as a form of welfare while they produce zero results. The Dems hire canvassers and activists on indeed. Their strategies work. You all look like retards thinking EVERY election is won through cheating. permalink award report block reply mailinvoter 2 points 6 days ago If the demonrats could win without election fraud, then why do they do it? permalink parent award report block reply\nmailinvoter 2 points 6 days ago If the demonrats could win without election fraud, then why do they do it? permalink parent award report block reply\nEyesSewnShut 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\nEyesSewnShut 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply",
