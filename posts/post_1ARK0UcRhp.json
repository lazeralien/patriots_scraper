If the praying impedes or interferes with others rights in public then it's disorderly conduct... Banning public prayer that isn't interfering with others public rights isn't doable... permalink parent award report block reply Zskills 1 points 7 days ago You don't need to pass any new laws to make that happen though.   So what exactly is being banned,  all those things are already banned permalink parent award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 2 points 7 days ago You asked specifically about banning public prayer, I gave you an answer to what I believe is in accordance with the law. The other \"things\" Valentina wants to ban would be more appropriate for her to address as it's her platform. I will agree that burqas could be banned in private establishments including banking institutions, jewelry stores, restaurants, and, public institutions with dress codes such as schools, hospitals, nuclear facilities, etc... Reasons..., many, but two would be top of the list. 1) Concealment of identity and weapons for nefarious purposes. 2) Inspiration for non-muslims to conceal identity and weapons for nefarious purposes. The U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause ensures that federal and state laws take precedence over any foreign or religious legal codes, including Sharia (Islamic law), in civil or criminal matters. Valentina may be suggesting \"banning\" Sharia at the state level across the US. Currently only Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, explicitly reference foreign or religious law bans including Sharia. Her generalizations need to be refined if she wants to be a serious candidate... She's got spunk... Needs to mature politically...
