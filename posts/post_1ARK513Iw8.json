In the Terms of Service Agreements (that no one ever reads) it said the power company would discount your power by a fraction of a % in exchange for being able to remote access your thermostat and shut off the A/C and heat. When the power demand was too high, the power did rolling blackouts, plus shut down A/C in \"smart\" homes. permalink award report block reply UltimatePistachio 13 points 6 days ago I use these things all the time. You just buy one from wherever and install it yourself. You don't enroll it in anything and you can control it. I don't like how it has to phone home into the thermostats servers but there's nothing forcing you to enroll in a power savings program. Now, yes, power companies do offer incentives where they clearly tell you that if you enroll in their program they'll send you one of these thermostats (probably ecobee) where they'll control your AC remotely to save you that money they offer. I never seen that as something trying to be sneaky - I think people just enrolled in this shit only seeing how they're getting FREE SHIT and didn't read the NOT SO FINE print about how they will control the thermostat... permalink parent award report block reply fazaman 7 points 6 days ago Not sure who down voted you, but you're correct. permalink parent award report block reply UltimatePistachio 5 points 6 days ago I know but I think there's a lot of luddites who will just simplify this as \"don't need this shit it's bad\" and don't care to get into the details, which is fine because they're generally right - they probably don't want or care to micromanage their utilities. I have been living across 2 houses for years now - the ecobees help me to manage the heat and AC across them. One is on a natural gas furnace and AC, the other I rigged up to work with a pellet stove and I use Sinope thermostats for the baseboard heaters. They've been working great to save me money since I can turn the heat off when I'm not around, then turn it on as I'm on my way to another house. If one is getting too cold I can bump up the temp. Even if I didn't have more than one house, I'd want to have remote control of all sources of heat and AC because I might be prone to forget to turn something off while I'm out for the day. Savings do add up, even more so for a situation like my own. I'm in the process of getting a new house and I'm probably going to figure out a way to rig my own thermostat that will just talk to my server only - these things are just a thermometer with relays and maybe a nice added humidistat with a display for the time, temperature, and weather. permalink parent award report block reply HiddenDekuScrub 3 points 6 days ago IMO, it's okay to have the gadgets if you know what you're getting into.

Not every nerd is a pRedditor. permalink parent award report block reply ThisTrainHasNoBrakes 2 points 6 days ago If you want smart home features but not the terrible stuff that comes with it, you need: A local network.  All \u201csmart\u201d devices should only connect to local network.  it\u2019s fine if things wifi, but said local network  should have no internet access Local server like Home Assistant.  Can connect to closed network and open internet. If you want to control things remotely, VPN in to HA or make it otherwise accessible externally through your firewall. Never connect devices directly to your phone through WiFi or Bluetooth.  Always control devices through HA or other open source equivalent If the above is too technical for you to do or learn to do\u2026skip smart home features if you aren\u2019t okay with the loss of security.  Or do use them in the right context.  Example:  ring cameras and the like give up security but for the convenience/seciriry it\u2019s not bad tradeoff if they are outside your home (my opinion). Edit:  and for crying out loud, don\u2019t have your phones or tablets with you at all times.  Break the addition.  And don\u2019t have internet-connected TVs.  Why the hell do they have microphones, I wonder?  stream from a device without mic if you need that. permalink award report block reply wlatic 2 points 6 days ago Wait until these people learn you can reflash the cheap Chinese crap into local devices! permalink parent award report block reply ThisTrainHasNoBrakes 2 points 6 days ago Gotta start somewhere!  these are just my 4 litmus tests.  I don\u2019t trust any device which is why they don\u2019t get network access.

You can buy smart devices that are local only. You can run your own llm to interact with.

All \u201csmart\u201d devices should only connect to local network.  it\u2019s fine if things wifi, but said local network  should have no internet access Local server like Home Assistant.  Can connect to closed network and open internet. If you want to control things remotely, VPN in to HA or make it otherwise accessible externally through your firewall. Never connect devices directly to your phone through WiFi or Bluetooth.  Always control devices through HA or other open source equivalent If the above is too technical for you to do or learn to do\u2026skip smart home features if you aren\u2019t okay with the loss of security.  Or do use them in the right context.  Example:  ring cameras and the like give up security but for the convenience/seciriry it\u2019s not bad tradeoff if they are outside your home (my opinion). Edit:  and for crying out loud, don\u2019t have your phones or tablets with you at all times.  Break the addition.  And don\u2019t have internet-connected TVs.  Why the hell do they have microphones, I wonder?  stream from a device without mic if you need that. permalink award report block reply wlatic 2 points 6 days ago Wait until these people learn you can reflash the cheap Chinese crap into local devices! permalink parent award report block reply ThisTrainHasNoBrakes 2 points 6 days ago Gotta start somewhere!  these are just my 4 litmus tests.  I don\u2019t trust any device which is why they don\u2019t get network access.  For all I know though\u2026they do anyway through their own device - like new cars do with a built in SIM. permalink parent award report block reply wlatic 1 points 6 days ago Vlan or ip block? permalink parent award report block reply Jamps 2 points 6 days ago This.
