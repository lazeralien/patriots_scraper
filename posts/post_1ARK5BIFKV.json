I didn't notice Rudi so much when he was younger, seeing him targetted made me go back to his earlier years. The guy cleaned up New York, did great things.

He would not be diplomatic or gentle in hopes of currying favor, he would be out for the blood of the swamp. He is exactly what we need as AG. So he's getting old.. so what. He's more than capable of assigning cases and ordering investigations. Pam Blondi will never do anything except go on TV and talk, and talk and talk to no end. permalink parent award report block reply snoopy3210 2 points 2 days ago Seriously he knows where the bodies are buried. Starting with Biden\u2019 money transfers to his family members via shell companies and 50% for the big guy (it wasn\u2019t 10% that was a comment from a stranger, Hunter said he was giving 50% to father Joe!

The Appellate Division of the new[sic] york[sic] Supreme Court controls who gets to be an attorney in new york. (Supreme Court is the Regular Trial Court, Court of Appeals is \"highest\" in new york) they will not reinstate him. Should be like every other regulatory body (rules by the legislature, administrated by the executive, adjudicated by the courts) permalink parent award report block reply Hawksendoom 6 points 3 days ago annnnd i hate how you are fucking right. :D permalink parent award report block reply Mathelm 4 points 3 days ago anytime, you aren't the first to say that. permalink parent award report block reply BarneyFrank 2 points 3 days ago Re-barred?

Trump is wayyy too nice permalink parent award report block reply Apersonofinterest 9 points 3 days ago Trump is leaving no man behind. He came back for the J6\u2019ers, he came back for his friends and the people who supported and defended him. That\u2019s the kind of leader I will go to war with. permalink parent award report block reply Trollasaurus 4 points 2 days ago She didn\u2019t support him she turned on him and went on a media parade backstabbing him permalink parent award report block reply RedCalifornia 3 points 2 days ago Jenna Ellis? Yeah pretty sure she was compromised from the start. Who benefitted from the chaos of the 2020 election? permalink parent award report block reply RedCalifornia 1 points 2 days ago If there aren\u2019t arrests or trials, even for the monster who murdered Ashli, he\u2019s not \u201cleaving no man behind\u201d permalink parent award report block reply Apersonofinterest 1 points 2 days ago I\u2019m talking about his supporters that were punished for supporting him. That\u2019s what \u201cleave no man behind\u201d means. You\u2019re changing the subject to shit on Trump some more. Everyone can see what you people are doing. permalink parent award report block reply TheRedPike 3 points 2 days ago The smooth brains that gave her the deal eventually figured out she was of zero use to them. permalink parent award report block reply darkmodeforgotpass 19 points 3 days ago What about all the shit they robbed and thieved from him like the thugs they are? permalink award report block reply progressives4Trump 15 points 3 days ago Mike lindell? permalink award report block reply phibetared 7 points 3 days ago Don't know, can't find.

But he did say it was not an exhaustive list. permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 13 points 3 days ago John Eastman was absolutely railroaded.

They did nothing wrong. 2020 needs to be exposed for the treasonous stolen election that it was. These people need to be fully vindicated as the heroes they are. permalink award report block reply Piglips 3 points 2 days ago Tina Peters? permalink award report block reply FlyCatcher94 2 points 2 days ago Unfortunately she was convicted of state crimes which he has no jurisdiction over. permalink parent award report block reply Piglips 1 points 2 days ago Yeah, i know, but im still ragging on it.

Can he pardon for those? permalink award report block reply MasterChief08 11 points 3 days ago It means the federal government can never again try to go after them. They were trying to elevate everything to the feds. The Georgia cases are dead. The state legislature and higher courts pretty much put an end to it after Fanni got caught sleeping with the head attorney. You're right that he can't pardon state crimes but Georgia is over. permalink parent award report block reply Aisle-is-closed 1 points 2 days ago Tiny Peters? Or are those charges all state level? permalink award report block reply DenturesNancy 1 points 2 days ago didn't Boris Ephstein jump ship and joined the Ron DeSantis failed wagon? permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 1 points 2 days ago But not Tina Peters, sadly permalink award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 2 days ago How did this take a YEAR? permalink award report block reply dataonly 1 points 2 days ago Wait... A president can directly sign a pardon?  Thought the vast majority were products of the \"autopen\"? Who knew? permalink award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 2 days ago Apparently without even knowing whom he is pardoning.. permalink parent award report block reply Overtaxed 1 points 2 days ago What took so long? permalink award report block reply Klaus73 2 points 2 days ago Aye seems weird it took over a year given the J6 pardons were like 2 months. permalink parent award report block reply SaltyTitties4 1 points 2 days ago Mark Meadows is a lying spy for China. permalink award report block reply maverick202 0 points 2 days ago Based!! No one deserved to be pardoned more than Giuliani! permalink award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 1 points 2 days ago U/maverick202 is a shill who is a self-admitted \u201ctroll\u201d who comes here to insult this community, and also believes Joe Biden won 81 million votes lmfao. He occasionally posts normal takes to blend in permalink parent award report block reply PKC_MAN -5 points 3 days ago Why did he wait 1 year to do that? permalink award report block reply Apersonofinterest 9 points 3 days ago He\u2019s busy. He\u2019s got a lot of shit going on ya know? Complicated business. Too many people don\u2019t seem to appreciate the miracle we have right now. It\u2019s never good enough. If he does a thing, it wasn\u2019t fast enough or what about this other thing he didn\u2019t do? He\u2019s a sell out!!! Reeee\u2026 permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 2 days ago Well no - its a question; stop taking everything as an attack. Like was there some sort of pushback? Some sort of reason?\nConsider this - dude chose to go play golf multiple times rather then stop his most ardent supporters from rotting in prison; if the reason is \"he was just too darn busy\". I suspect there were other reasons; given how fast the j6 pardons came its actually a question worth asking especially when most of the legalese shit should have been able to be handled by Pam \"Heels up on her desk\" Bondi. permalink parent award report block reply NYforTrump 2 points 3 days ago Yeah he should have just done it back in January when he did the J6 cases. permalink parent award report block reply EyesSewnShut 0 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\neclectic22 227 points 3 days ago They deserve not only the pardon, but the full restitution of the legal expenses they have incurred. permalink award report block reply Blackmore 110 points 3 days ago They need or deserve their life back. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 93 points 3 days ago Rudy as AG. permalink parent award report block reply jedfag 33 points 3 days ago Fuck YEAH! permalink parent award report block reply posedgeclk 7 points 2 days ago I am 100% for it.

He would not be diplomatic or gentle in hopes of currying favor, he would be out for the blood of the swamp. He is exactly what we need as AG. So he's getting old.. so what. He's more than capable of assigning cases and ordering investigations. Pam Blondi will never do anything except go on TV and talk, and talk and talk to no end. permalink parent award report block reply\nsnoopy3210 2 points 2 days ago Seriously he knows where the bodies are buried.
