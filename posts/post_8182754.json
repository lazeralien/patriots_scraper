He funded Lenin and sent him into Russia to destroy it from within. After the Bolsheviks took over, they almost immediately surrendered to the Entente Powers in March 1918 in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Russia just gave up all claims to Eastern European territories to Germany. With the eastern front won, Germany shifted its he bulk of its force to Western Europe. permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 13 points 1 day ago It was the equivalent of sending in some hipster Democratic Socialists into Europe now and thinking it would be funny.

The Kaiser probably didn't know what was going on. permalink parent award report block reply Cyber1776 OP 5 points 1 day ago No, the German high command literally funded Lenin\u2019s return trip to Russia. The Tsar has abdicated, a new interim government was established and were set to have their first ever elections, but the intern government was still in the war against Germany. The Kaiser wanted Lenin in control because he preached an immediate end to the war and the Kaiser knew he would start a civil war in Russia, which he did. permalink parent award report block reply SqRt7744 3 points 1 day ago While that is literally true, it's incomplete. He was no communist but was forced to destabilize Russia for tactical purposes - brilliant, actually. All of this was caused by the war which they would have already won in 1916 if the USA hadn't gotten involved. And why did the USA get involved? They were dragged in by the Zionists to rescue the British in exchange for the British promising them Palestine (yes, this is insane but true). The result was everything that followed - from the rise of fascism as a pan-European anti communist movement to the capturing of half the globe by the communists, millions of deaths in WW2 and eventual subjugation of the west to Israel, as well as the total downfall of western Christian civilization and destruction of western man. permalink parent award report block reply AliceCooperBiden 4 points 1 day ago \u201cWar which they would have already won\u201d Dude they were in a stalemate for 3 years before the US gets involved lol. The US entered the war in 1917 not 1916. The Germans weren\u2019t winning and were actually doing pretty bad with the war of attrition that was going on. Because the US was funding the Entente and Germans had really no one significant funding them.  Also how you excuse communism as \u201che was forced to do it\u201d is pathetic. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... covok48 2 points 1 day ago (((Zimmerman))) telegram. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

TallestSkill -1 points 1 day ago The United States entered World War I in April 1917 because Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare that was sinking American merchant ships and killing civilians. The Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany tried to convince Mexico to attack the United States, was the final cause that pushed Wilson to act. The Balfour Declaration came later in November 1917. It was a British statement of support for a Jewish homeland issued after the United States had already joined the war. It was not a treaty or a deal. It was a short letter from the British Foreign Secretary to Lord Rothschild, a British Jewish leader, expressing sympathy for Zionist goals. There is no evidence that American Zionists had the political power to pull the United States into war. President Wilson\u2019s decision came from global strategy and domestic pressure, not from Jewish influence. The story that \u201cZionists dragged America into World War I\u201d began as Nazi propaganda. It was created to blame Jews for Germany\u2019s loss and to justify antisemitism. Blaming an entire people for a world war is weak history. The conflict began through a chain reaction among European empires, military plans, and nationalist ambitions, not through any hidden ethnic conspiracy. The true results of the war, such as the Treaty of Versailles, economic collapse, the rise of communism and fascism, and the second world war, came from the failure of European elites to reform after the destruction of industrial warfare. The early Zionist movement played only a small role until Britain saw it as useful leverage in the dying Ottoman Empire. America entered the war because Germany was acting like a pirate state. The story of a \u201cZionist deal for Palestine\u201d is a myth that survives only because it gives people a single villain to blame for a complex and tragic chapter of history. permalink parent award report block reply view 8 more comments... bejeavis 1 points 1 day ago It's a nice thing to see when you're not the only one who knows history. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 9 points 1 day ago The US had no business being part of it, but the bankers knew how much money and influence they could gain and they were right so here we are today still under their thumb. permalink parent award report block reply stillbringingitback 1 points 19 hours ago \u2026so far lol permalink parent award report block reply mohel 0 points 1 day ago Why did it happen? permalink parent award report block reply JohnN 3 points 1 day ago Tough to say precisely.

Treaty that ended WW11 was no peach either.  It forbade Japan and Germany from having a military.  The US had to spend billions to protect them while they both became economic powerhouses. permalink parent award report block reply stars 2 points 1 day ago No look at the 1928 German election and then 1930. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 2 points 1 day ago And now\u2026 permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 1 points 14 hours ago Powerhouse is relative. None ever rivaled the US. And Japan has changed course and is building a real military besides its defense force while being one of a handful of only true allies left permalink parent award report block reply bejeavis 2 points 1 day ago Who is really responsible for WW2? France. permalink parent award report block reply stars 0 points 1 day ago No the great depression is objectively what caused his rise. permalink parent award report block reply Cyber1776 OP 3 points 1 day ago I don\u2019t buy this take anymore bc the terms on Germany after WW2 were much more severe. permalink parent award report block reply stjimmy92 1 points 1 day ago The biggest difference is that there was a reconstruction effort after WW2 (largely bankrolled by the US, shockingly /s) to prevent a repeat  of the conditions after WW1, plus things got really bad when the Great Depression hit, which also didn\u2019t recur after WW2 permalink parent award report block reply rambler045 1 points 1 day ago Which is why we didn't punish them or the Japanese so severely after WWII. That and the smart ones had already figured out communism was the bigger problem. permalink parent award report block reply plateowner2024 14 points 1 day ago \"A veteran is someone who, at one point in their life, wrote a blank check made payable to \u2018The United States of America,\u2019 for an amount up to and including their life.\" \u2014 Unknown permalink award report block reply 67Vert 8 points 1 day ago Or was drafted and sent into war against their will, coerced into signing a blank check. permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 9 points 1 day ago Even though it's about the Brits I'm gonna watch They Shall Not Grow Old again.

Fucking shit people went through hell. permalink award report block reply Cyber1776 OP 6 points 1 day ago I recommend this one, I post it all the time.

Ghosts of the Ostrafront is probably my favorite. What looked like a snow covered field in the summer a journalist wrote in the 90\u2019s was actually a bone yard filled with what once was retreating reich soldiers from Stalingrad. permalink parent award report block reply USMC1234O10 9 points 1 day ago SEMPER FUCKING FIDELIS permalink award report block reply DogPilledMAGA 2 points 1 day ago I know it is early in the day but I would love to buy you a beer. permalink parent award report block reply USMC1234O10 4 points 1 day ago I ONLY DRINK THE BLOOD OF COMMIES AND MUDSLIMES I HAVE KILLED WITH MY BARE HANDS.

Plenty of us veterans are good people. permalink parent award report block reply AliceCooperBiden 7 points 1 day ago I think it\u2019s important to remember that the war was absolutely a tragedy but gets even worse when you remember that a lot of 14,15 and 16 year olds lied about their ages and volunteered. Not understanding what they were getting into. WW1 was just the worst war in human history. WW2 is more well known by people but the First World War was just so much more brutal than the second one. permalink award report block reply someguy7738 5 points 1 day ago The damage that war did to the European gene pool is almost inconceivable. All those teens wiped off the face of the Earth who had not yet even had children of their own, entire bloodlines just gone. permalink parent award report block reply AliceCooperBiden 3 points 1 day ago Millions of them just gone and all for nothing.

Armistice Day. The Great War is over and chaos comes to Germany.\nThe German Empire is dead. Emperor Wilhelm II is forced to abdicate his throne, exiled to the Netherlands. He will never see the Fatherland again.\nCommunists prowl the streets like wolves. There are still loyal men, good men. They are the lucky ones who survived the bloodshed or were too young to have served, but they are leaderless. Intuitively they understand things are going to get worse.\nJanuary 5, 1919. Trouble starts. Communists stage a general workers' strike. Led by Karl Liebknecht and the jewess Rosa Luxemberg, the Communist Party of Germany take to the streets, terrorizing small business owners. They demand power be handed over to a network of Soviet-style councils to carry out \"the will of the people.\" After 7 days of anarchy, the so-called Spartacist Uprising is put down by patriots from the Freikorps. The jewish leaders are executed.\nBut the communists smell blood in the water. They are just getting started.\nJanuary 7, 1919. Munich. Kurt Eisner, a middle-class jewish journalist and rabble-rouser, appoints himself Minister-President of Bavaria. A communist utopian, Eisner declares his Bavarian regime will be \"a government of kindness... a realm of light, beauty and reason.\" Problem is, none of his lieutenants are Bavarian. Like himself, to a man, they are jewish intellectuals, and of course communists. After enduring the indignity of Eisner's reign for only 1 month, the Germans of Bavaria finally have had enough. Eisner is shot dead by a nationalist patriot on Feb 21.\nThis drives the jewish communists into a frenzy. Again they take to the streets, burning, looting and destroying everything in their path. Again they seize power.\nMarch 7, 1919. Bamberg. Ernst Toller, a jewish journalist and playwright, declares himself leader of a new Soviet Republic in Bavaria. After only 6 days, he is deposed by an even more radical jew, Eugen Levine. Levine cobbles together a \"Red Army\" from disgruntled jewish miscreants and factory workers, which proceeds to confiscate cash, homes, food and weapons from ordinary people. Levine's Army rededicates Munich's Cathedral to the \"Goddess of Reason.\"\nThis time the jews will not be ousted so easily. it will take more than 1 armed patriot to bring them down.\nThe Freikorps mobilizes against the communists to restore power to the German volk. Panicking and desperate to hold onto power, the Red Army barricades itself in Munich with aristocratic German hostages. With negotiations leading nowhere, all 10 hostages are executed by the jews. War break out in the city, leading to the death of over 300 German civilians.\nAugust 1919. The so-called German Revolution is over. The threat of communism has been subdued, but the jewish revolutionary spirit is not so easily extinguished. The Weimer Republic is coming...\nThe 1 year period between the end of WW1 and the beginning of the Weimer Republic is sometimes called the German Revolution.\nGermany essentially had no government, which led to dozens of communist and socialist groups (all ran by jews) frantically trying to spark a Bolshevik uprising to seize power. Hitler talks about this in Mein Kampf, but again the details are so hyper-specific in time and place that it's hard for an outsider to understand.\nAs awful and degenerate as the Weimar period was, for Germans at the time it was at least a stable respite from the communist anarchy which preceded it. -- I forget where I got that story from, but it's an entertaining read. permalink award report block reply Tongs_Ya_Bass 2 points 1 day ago Conclusion: deport the Jews. Never let them back in. permalink parent award report block reply someguy7738 2 points 1 day ago Never should have been involved in the first place.

Then they surrendered without a shot fired on German soil, signed the entire economic future over to western bankers and gave half the country away geographically. \ud83e\udd73 And isn't it an odd coincidence that a year earlier the Brits released a public declaration addressed to Lord Walter Rothschild of the infamous German Jewish banking family, promising their support for a Jewish homeland in Israel if they won the war? This was called the Balfour Declaration, and it was later discovered at the Paris Peace Conference that this declaration was in exchange for the zionists using their newly established power in the American federal reserve to bring the US into the war on behalf of the allied powers. Such a strange coincidence. It's almost as if Jewish communists sold their country down the river in exchange for Israel. \ud83e\udd14 And then one day, for no reason at all... permalink award report block reply\nJohnN 62 points 1 day ago WW1 was the worst catastrophe ever to befall human civilization. permalink award report block reply PhilipeNegro 44 points 1 day ago Yes, fighting the Kaiser gave rise to European communism, and just about every symptom of leftist cancer we deal with today. permalink parent award report block reply Cyber1776 OP 23 points 1 day ago The Kaiser literally is the reason communism exist in Europe.

TallestSkill -1 points 1 day ago The United States entered World War I in April 1917 because Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare that was sinking American merchant ships and killing civilians. The Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany tried to convince Mexico to attack the United States, was the final cause that pushed Wilson to act. The Balfour Declaration came later in November 1917. It was a British statement of support for a Jewish homeland issued after the United States had already joined the war. It was not a treaty or a deal. It was a short letter from the British Foreign Secretary to Lord Rothschild, a British Jewish leader, expressing sympathy for Zionist goals. There is no evidence that American Zionists had the political power to pull the United States into war. President Wilson\u2019s decision came from global strategy and domestic pressure, not from Jewish influence. The story that \u201cZionists dragged America into World War I\u201d began as Nazi propaganda. It was created to blame Jews for Germany\u2019s loss and to justify antisemitism. Blaming an entire people for a world war is weak history. The conflict began through a chain reaction among European empires, military plans, and nationalist ambitions, not through any hidden ethnic conspiracy. The true results of the war, such as the Treaty of Versailles, economic collapse, the rise of communism and fascism, and the second world war, came from the failure of European elites to reform after the destruction of industrial warfare. The early Zionist movement played only a small role until Britain saw it as useful leverage in the dying Ottoman Empire. America entered the war because Germany was acting like a pirate state. The story of a \u201cZionist deal for Palestine\u201d is a myth that survives only because it gives people a single villain to blame for a complex and tragic chapter of history. permalink parent award report block reply view 8 more comments... bejeavis 1 points 1 day ago It's a nice thing to see when you're not the only one who knows history. permalink parent award report block reply\nCyber1776 OP 23 points 1 day ago The Kaiser literally is the reason communism exist in Europe. He funded Lenin and sent him into Russia to destroy it from within. After the Bolsheviks took over, they almost immediately surrendered to the Entente Powers in March 1918 in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

Armistice Day. The Great War is over and chaos comes to Germany.\nThe German Empire is dead. Emperor Wilhelm II is forced to abdicate his throne, exiled to the Netherlands. He will never see the Fatherland again.\nCommunists prowl the streets like wolves. There are still loyal men, good men. They are the lucky ones who survived the bloodshed or were too young to have served, but they are leaderless. Intuitively they understand things are going to get worse.\nJanuary 5, 1919. Trouble starts. Communists stage a general workers' strike. Led by Karl Liebknecht and the jewess Rosa Luxemberg, the Communist Party of Germany take to the streets, terrorizing small business owners. They demand power be handed over to a network of Soviet-style councils to carry out \"the will of the people.\" After 7 days of anarchy, the so-called Spartacist Uprising is put down by patriots from the Freikorps. The jewish leaders are executed.\nBut the communists smell blood in the water. They are just getting started.\nJanuary 7, 1919. Munich. Kurt Eisner, a middle-class jewish journalist and rabble-rouser, appoints himself Minister-President of Bavaria. A communist utopian, Eisner declares his Bavarian regime will be \"a government of kindness... a realm of light, beauty and reason.\" Problem is, none of his lieutenants are Bavarian. Like himself, to a man, they are jewish intellectuals, and of course communists. After enduring the indignity of Eisner's reign for only 1 month, the Germans of Bavaria finally have had enough. Eisner is shot dead by a nationalist patriot on Feb 21.\nThis drives the jewish communists into a frenzy. Again they take to the streets, burning, looting and destroying everything in their path. Again they seize power.\nMarch 7, 1919. Bamberg. Ernst Toller, a jewish journalist and playwright, declares himself leader of a new Soviet Republic in Bavaria. After only 6 days, he is deposed by an even more radical jew, Eugen Levine. Levine cobbles together a \"Red Army\" from disgruntled jewish miscreants and factory workers, which proceeds to confiscate cash, homes, food and weapons from ordinary people. Levine's Army rededicates Munich's Cathedral to the \"Goddess of Reason.\"\nThis time the jews will not be ousted so easily. it will take more than 1 armed patriot to bring them down.\nThe Freikorps mobilizes against the communists to restore power to the German volk. Panicking and desperate to hold onto power, the Red Army barricades itself in Munich with aristocratic German hostages. With negotiations leading nowhere, all 10 hostages are executed by the jews. War break out in the city, leading to the death of over 300 German civilians.\nAugust 1919. The so-called German Revolution is over. The threat of communism has been subdued, but the jewish revolutionary spirit is not so easily extinguished. The Weimer Republic is coming...\nThe 1 year period between the end of WW1 and the beginning of the Weimer Republic is sometimes called the German Revolution.\nGermany essentially had no government, which led to dozens of communist and socialist groups (all ran by jews) frantically trying to spark a Bolshevik uprising to seize power. Hitler talks about this in Mein Kampf, but again the details are so hyper-specific in time and place that it's hard for an outsider to understand.\nAs awful and degenerate as the Weimar period was, for Germans at the time it was at least a stable respite from the communist anarchy which preceded it. -- I forget where I got that story from, but it's an entertaining read. permalink award report block reply Tongs_Ya_Bass 2 points 1 day ago Conclusion: deport the Jews.

Then they surrendered without a shot fired on German soil, signed the entire economic future over to western bankers and gave half the country away geographically. \ud83e\udd73 And isn't it an odd coincidence that a year earlier the Brits released a public declaration addressed to Lord Walter Rothschild of the infamous German Jewish banking family, promising their support for a Jewish homeland in Israel if they won the war? This was called the Balfour Declaration, and it was later discovered at the Paris Peace Conference that this declaration was in exchange for the zionists using their newly established power in the American federal reserve to bring the US into the war on behalf of the allied powers. Such a strange coincidence. It's almost as if Jewish communists sold their country down the river in exchange for Israel. \ud83e\udd14 And then one day, for no reason at all... permalink award report block reply"
