For example, give Trump the power to ban radical leftists and trannies from having guns, and the next Democratic president decides to use it against MAGA. It reminds me of the people who talk about forcing ID verification on the internet because you want to use it to stop kids from looking at porn. The problem with that is it won't end with porn, and next thing you know, it's being used to unmask someone on social media who said AOC is a moron or Mamdani is burning NYC to the ground. permalink parent award report block reply Parabellum76 3 points 6 days ago They\u2019re gonna do it anyways, they quite obviously don\u2019t care about the law. permalink parent award report block reply LolOkFBI 7 points 6 days ago No we want asylums and deportations for them permalink parent award report block reply load 3 more comments...\nasdrubael_was_right 58 points 6 days ago Imma need some context for this meme. permalink award report block reply geckogreen 78 points 6 days ago I didn't watch the whole interview but the lady kept trying to bait Sydney sween into revealing her politics.

That totally won't go wrong! No conservative ever wants to give the government more power. That's a socialist position. The government should be stripped of it's power. Not given a free pass to lock anyone up forever which it deems is a threat to them. That's the most anti-american horseshit right there. permalink parent award report block reply PensivePatriot 8 points 6 days ago That\u2019s nice, but we need insane asylums. permalink parent award report block reply AerialRush 1 points 5 days ago \"Never do anything and always let your enemy dictate how you will live forever instead of beating them at the pass.\" permalink parent award report block reply\nPrussian_Pepe -3 points 6 days ago Yes we NEED the government building facilities to house people it believes are a threat to the public safety.
