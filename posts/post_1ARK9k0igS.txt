Especially in California. Trump needs to really understand what is getting ready to explode here on our soil. He wants to stop the blood shed around the world, I get it. But he needs to realize that people like this will die along with everyone associated with them if he doesn’t do what we elected him to do. permalink award report block reply Atruckdriver 5 points 1 day ago Conservatives have been labeled deplorable, racist fascists, (etc) for years while being told we have to set aside our civilization and culture to accept a bunch of ungrateful lunatics and embrace their sick and broken culture. The eventual backlash will be terrifying. Not 2 more weeks, not a promise, not even a threat. Just an observation. We’ve all thought this. We’ve all imagined what we would do. It’s a man’s natural instinct. Multiply that idea by thousands, many trained in Middle Eastern sandboxes and the urban warfare required. I’m afraid to think what the igniter for the fire will be. For a day or two, I thought it would be Kirk’s murder. Nope. Not yet. permalink parent award report block reply aaafirefly123 1 points 1 day ago I don’t know about executions.
