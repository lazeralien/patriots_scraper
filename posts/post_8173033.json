If the Dems lose the MIdterms, they're basically finished as a national party on the Federal level, and they'd be lucky to be left with the rotting urban core enclaves they've held for decades.

Should be equally legal to throw sandwiches at judges for ummm... protesting for illegal's legal rights or something permalink parent award report block reply YearninNation 2 points 5 days ago San Francisco Democrats in the 1970s had significant political ties to Jim Jones, the leader of the Peoples Temple, which later ended in the mass suicide at Jonestown in 1978.\nJones cultivated strong relationships with prominent Democratic figures, leveraging his ability to deliver large numbers of followers for rallies, campaign work, and voter turnout, which made him a valuable political ally. Mayor George Moscone, whose 1975 mayoral victory was allegedly aided by voter fraud involving Peoples Temple members bused in to vote multiple times, appointed Jones to the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission and later made him its chairman, effectively making Jones the city\u2019s largest landlord.\nMoscone likely owed his election to Jones and the Temple\u2019s political support. Other key Democrats also embraced Jones. Assemblyman Willie Brown, who later became Speaker of the California Assembly and mayor of San Francisco, compared Jones to Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Chairman Mao, calling him a \u201cclose personal friend and a highly trusted brother in the struggle for liberation\u201d.\nHarvey Milk, the city supervisor and gay rights activist, wrote Jones a letter expressing deep admiration, stating, \u201cThe first time I heard you, you made a statement: \u2018Take one of us, and you must take all of us.\u2019 Please add my name\u201d.\nMilk referred to Jones as having \u201cgreatness\u201d and actively sought his political endorsement. Dianne Feinstein, then a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, joined her colleagues in honoring Jones \u201cin recognition of his guidance and inspiration\u201d in advancing humanitarian programs.\nNancy Pelosi, who was then the chair of the California Democratic Party for Northern California, was also part of the political circle that supported Jones. At the national level, Jones met privately with Rosalynn Carter during the 1976 presidential campaign and introduced her at a campaign event.\nVice-presidential candidate Walter Mondale also held a private meeting with Jones upon landing in San Francisco. permalink award report block reply Seruna_Kanus 1 points 5 days ago I would imagine subway would love short stocks. permalink award report block reply Speedgraphic69 1 points 5 days ago Water skiing on the Lake of Fire with John McCain and Dickhead Cheney permalink award report block reply Aggrieved03 1 points 5 days ago Pajeet owned. permalink award report block reply Thunnus73 1 points 5 days ago Bela Pelosi's House On The Hill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i043gWMKAVg permalink award report block reply USNVET71 -1 points 5 days ago What a disgusting evil cunt permalink award report block reply SteveBannonsNckbeard -2 points 5 days ago Pretty low effort/retarded meme.
