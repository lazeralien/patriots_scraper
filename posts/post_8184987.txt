Our son will be 6 in February. I still have his first sonogram image as my cellphone background wallpaper. He was the size of a grape at the time. Fascinating. You can see thru them, their spine and heart beating.. truly a miracle of God. The real fun begins moments after delivery. You will never be the same again.

My mother had her first child. Then three miscarriages.   Doctor  says she’ll never conceive again.  Then she had eight more children. permalink award report block reply ancroidubh 25 points 6 hours ago Welcome to the most difficult yet most rewarding job of your lifetime. May God bless you all. permalink award report block reply JtBlaze 21 points 6 hours ago Priceless. permalink award report block reply GA_Logic 19 points 6 hours ago Congratulations! permalink award report block reply E-dantes 17 points 6 hours ago Amen, fren. God is good. May you be blessed with sleepless nights and baby giggles, great memories, and a lifetime of love to give to that child! The struggle is so worth it every time my kids look at me and smile, whether they've challenged themselves in completing a task, or when they goof up. Every smile makes every days struggle worth it. permalink award report block reply KiekhaeferSoldier 13 points 4 hours ago Wife & I married late... (35yrs old) and while "waiting until we could afford kids" my 20yr old nephew fathered his third child with a third mother.  We decidd then that we needed children to offset the damage my nephew was doing.  After third miscarriage, her OB said, "Keep trying.  This is just God's way of sorting out the good eggs".  Our daughter is now 21, brilliant, 4.0+ in Junior year to become a doctor.  She is KILLIN' it.  She walked on 1st birthday, could sing National Anthem at 18 months, speaks perfect, proper english (never spoke baby talk to her), converses perfectly with other adults, scoffs at peer pressure and is a great driver! (can change a flat, too!).
Read to your daughter!  Enjoy silly cat videos with her.  Point out lunatics in public so she recognizes them.  Don't ever be vulgar around her, or your wife.  Drop what you're doing and welcome her when she arrives home or even enters a room. Oh, and teach her sign language!  We started before 6months old and it completely eliminated "The terrible two's" because she could sign WAY BEFORE she could speak. permalink award report block reply MawdT20 OP 6 points 4 hours ago Reading to the baby is #1 on my activities list to do with her! We've already started adding books to the shelves in the nursery. permalink parent award report block reply KiekhaeferSoldier 6 points 4 hours ago Go to thrift stores (goodwill, salvation army, etc...) and buy up all the OLD (pre-1980's) "Little Golden Book" series.  They have all the best nursery rhymes, stories and wholesome content and can be passed down to your future grandchildren!!
Also, right NOW, buy this book!!!  Best thing ever, written like an old Boy Scout Handbook and I loved it! https://www.amazon.com/Be-Prepared-Gary-Greenberg/dp/0743251547 permalink parent award report block reply Karma 11 points 6 hours ago She looks beautiful! permalink award report block reply SisterCovfefeToo 10 points 6 hours ago Congratulations! permalink award report block reply Fundadores 8 points 5 hours ago I can’t know God’s thought process, but for those of us who struggled to conceive, I imagine it’s His way of cementing it in our minds that “you wanted this” which is helpful when things get difficult. You’ll have so much joy, and no help needed during those times, but you’ll also have challenges. Never forget how much you wanted it and how God honored that and blessed you with the responsibility. You can also be proud of yourself and your wife for having the courage to keep trying. That’s a rough season. Thanks for sharing! She has an adorable, sweet little face. permalink award report block reply Copen45 7 points 6 hours ago that is awesome... congratulations brother permalink award report block reply Seatacjoe 7 points 6 hours ago Oh brother, praying for you and your wife permalink award report block reply glow-operator-2-0 6 points 5 hours ago Why is this post categorized as NSFW?

We had years of miscarriages and a newborn loss, (our son had down syndrome and had a lot of health issues). Before our first ultrasound at 6 weeks, I prayed to God and he told me "this is the one". I don't fully understand why we have to go through all the hardships, but now holding my daughter I can say it was all worth it. God bless you and your family! permalink award report block reply CaptainN 6 points 5 hours ago Congrats! The wife and I have been trying, without success, for awhile now.

Those ultrasound pictures are weird. I still have ours tucked away. Hopefully, they haven't "developed" more over the years and turned into black paper sheets. Our first was a boy, and I never saw proof of that in the ultrasound images. However, our daughter was instantly identified. My wife and the nurse were like, oh, it's a girl. I struggled at first, then embarrassed, I said. Oh, I see it now. Plain as day, it was as if she had and OF page in the womb. permalink award report block reply MawdT20 OP 3 points 5 hours ago I had a similar experience at the anatomy scan. The ultrasound tech goes, "I'm calling it, it's a girl! See the 3 lines?" I was struggling to make anything out at that appt. and I was like, "Yeah, yeah... Uh, and those would be...?" My wife and the tech gave each other a bemused look and the tech finally answers, "Her labia." permalink parent award report block reply AlmostFullyDilated -1 points 3 hours ago don't count your chickens until they hatch permalink award report block reply SHILL_DETECTOR -6 points 6 hours ago what is that permalink award report block reply MawdT20 OP 12 points 6 hours ago A side profile of her face.

Genji_Sama 2 points 4 hours ago Public service announcement: Polyester underwear reduces male fertility (it's just temporary). Well backed research shows this. In one study, after 180 days of tight polyester underwear, 100% of mean were completely infertile. They all eventually returned to normal but it took a year and a half for some participants. permalink award report block reply

MacGordon 1 points 43 minutes ago Grats man. The more I watch and read, especially Gary Brecka, the more I'm seeing a correlation with woman having fertility issues along side dietary issues, and it's usually an absences of ruminant meat consumption. Just keep feeding her steak & burger patties, lol. Enjoy parenthood. It's amazing. permalink award report block reply

Pelosi_Halitosis 1 points 5 hours ago Congratulations! Those ultrasound pictures are weird. I still have ours tucked away. Hopefully, they haven't "developed" more over the years and turned into black paper sheets. Our first was a boy, and I never saw proof of that in the ultrasound images. However, our daughter was instantly identified. My wife and the nurse were like, oh, it's a girl. I struggled at first, then embarrassed, I said. Oh, I see it now. Plain as day, it was as if she had and OF page in the womb. permalink award report block reply MawdT20 OP 3 points 5 hours ago I had a similar experience at the anatomy scan. The ultrasound tech goes, "I'm calling it, it's a girl! See the 3 lines?" I was struggling to make anything out at that appt. and I was like, "Yeah, yeah... Uh, and those would be...?" My wife and the tech gave each other a bemused look and the tech finally answers, "Her labia." permalink parent award report block reply
