Reward friends, punish enemies. It's the easiest playbook created and they're like \"we'll just punish you slightly less hard\" and taxes go from 30% to 28% like oh gee thanks. Democrats get free food, housing, debt forgiveness, free hellcats and chargers, healthcare, and on and on, and we get to fund all that just a little less. permalink award report block reply B0bE 5 points 6 days ago I like the direction, but that's awful wordy. permalink award report block reply O__Q OP 3 points 6 days ago Yeah\u2026gotta simplify it- I\u2019ll do better on round 2 :) permalink parent award report block reply B0bE 1 points 6 days ago HOW'S MY DRIVING ?\nCALL 1-866-DHS-2-ICE permalink parent award report block reply O__Q OP 5 points 6 days ago Figured if my teenager needs a \"Please Be Patient, Student Driver\" bumper sticker, these criminals do too! permalink award report block reply roadrunner0 2 points 6 days ago So they will be self tagging their vehicles so we know who to force off the highway?? permalink award report block reply Smurfection 2 points 6 days ago I had to wait six hours past my appointment at the DMV to get a Real ID.   I had to bring a load of paperwork. Just to find out, illegal alien invaders are getting Real IDs and not only that, CDL Real IDs and so far almost 100 have had \"no name given\" for their names. The people involved in this fraud need to be charged, possibly hanged, put in jail for life, deported with no chance to enter America again and their families, legal or illegal, tossed out of the country.  By family, I mean the whole clan and in the case of Indian nationals, the entire caste. I am sick of citizens being forced to jump through hoops, pay taxes and file all the right forms and do the right things just so Democrats and criminals can shit all over it and let their pets and flunkies run roughshot over the U.S. and our citizens. permalink award report block reply Keep_on_Trumpin 1 points 6 days ago \"Works for company: California\" permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey 1 points 6 days ago All true, except for the gratitude portion permalink award report block reply Dev404 1 points 6 days ago When your government treats foreign invaders better than the populace, you've already been conquered and don't know it. permalink award report block reply ParadigmShift2070 1 points 6 days ago should be written in Mexican permalink award report block reply 24601 1 points 6 days ago Missing the most important attribute: Indian permalink award report block reply breathittbill 1 points 6 days ago The first step to tearing a country apart is to not require everyone to speak the same language. permalink award report block reply Rudy_DankMemer 1 points 6 days ago Would be even more savage if this were written in CURSIVE.
