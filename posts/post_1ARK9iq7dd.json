Until now. permalink parent award report block reply schnazzmizzle 2 points 2 days ago Why would they stay in EMCON, that defeats the purpose of being on station, you don't just float around like cork.

I bet you're spot on. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz -1 points 2 days ago The cartels can easily afford to up the salary for the next 3 years. They can make the price high enough that these scumbags will gladly risk their essentially worthless lives. Just a handfull of pesos more. They know that maintaining the high supply in the US is worth eating a lot of profits. If people in the US start sobering up, they lose long term.

It's got to be enough to make it still 'worth it' for these cartel leaders to sacrifice their people (not that they care about their grunts) and their product because surely there have been enough of these publicly announced strikes that I would've thought the cartels would be thinking twice by now.

I suspect the latter being the real purpose....Having a large force sitting in the Caribbean is also very centrally located, they can go through the canal to break out into the pacific if China goes for it, or cross the atlantic either to the baltic if Russia goes for it, or the med if needs be for middle-east.  it's the most central place to set a carrier strike group permalink award report block reply YesImWhite 4 points 2 days ago its for Venezuela.

They are motivated well beyond the concern over physical or monetary casualties. This is actually crazy to consider.  Even under the threat of assured death, they are not stopping. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver 5 points 2 days ago Famous last words, \u201cJust watch ME do it!\u201d permalink parent award report block reply RustySheckelford 4 points 2 days ago It's also fucked how many Americans want their fucking drugs... permalink parent award report block reply Watermelons 3 points 2 days ago I wonder how many of the mules are coerced into this.

I suspect the latter being the real purpose....Having a large force sitting in the Caribbean is also very centrally located, they can go through the canal to break out into the pacific if China goes for it, or cross the atlantic either to the baltic if Russia goes for it, or the med if needs be for middle-east.  it's the most central place to set a carrier strike group permalink award report block reply YesImWhite 4 points 2 days ago its for Venezuela.
