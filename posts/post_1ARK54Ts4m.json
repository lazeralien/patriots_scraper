It is why high priced hookers cost what they do. It is all about the girlfriend experience and not just the sex. Israel buys the friendship of powerful people who have influence on the rest of us peasants and we are the ones stuck with the bill of cash and the blood of our children while we do the bidding of a foreign country.

It was really disgusting and what put me over the edge was the convention discussion about not evangelizing Jews any more. The Bible is clear, there is only one path and that is thru Jesus. It applies to all people of all faiths and without Jesus, there is no way of getting to Heaven. Pointing out that one fact to these retarded assholes made them red in the face mad so I left. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 3 points 5 days ago Once you accept that it is an entertainment business and the 'pastors' are there to increase their business, it makes a lot more sense. When I attend church I drop in money in the basket to cover my family as if we are going to a movie. They have the chutzpah to ask for tithes now. I laugh. It's the only part of the Old Covenant they expect people to keep. They'll eat bacon of course. They know they would lose 90% of their congregation if they preached different. But they'll still say God wants ten percent of your money before taxes. I just want a wholesome family event, but they make it an ordeal. I just don't feel it anymore. People are looking for something to believe in, but they won't find it at the social club calling itself a church.
