Thank God not everyone on this site is a beta simp. permalink parent award report block reply lixa 6 points 4 days ago Thanks. In all honesty I am a woman- but I'm happy to admit when another woman is beautiful or has an amazing body (she certainly does and so do I lol), but I think women should value themselves and present themselves with decency in the public eye. Hypocrites here downvote me while they claim to want a godly woman.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f permalink parent award report block reply LiveFreeInXorDie 3 points 4 days ago You're entirely correct. To me, Sweeney isn't far from being a prostitute. She seems to be a decent person, a saint by Hollywood standards, but no matter how based a prostitute may be, she's still a whore. No self-respecting man should settle for an active, unrepentant whore. Unfortunately, 99.9% (i.e., 1/1000 odds) of women in America seem to be, at minimum, whore-adjacent, if not in promiscuity than in general unsuitablity for marriage. The more women I meet, the more I come to understand the last few verses of Ecclesiastes 7. permalink parent award report block reply overblod 6 points 4 days ago That jawline... Man... permalink award report block reply clownworld30330 5 points 4 days ago Look at the interviewers forehead: full of frowning lines. Look at Sweeney\u2019s forehead: no frowning lines at all!! And Sweeney has deep, pronounced laugh lines. Sweeney lives her best life every day. The interviewer is a miserable, deeply unhappy person. permalink award report block reply Hikedelics 5 points 4 days ago Trump showed everyone the way to handle this shit 10 years ago. Glad people are finally starting to catch on. permalink award report block reply SenorTrumper 4 points 4 days ago What a slimy creature that woman is. permalink award report block reply Beat_to_Quarters 4 points 4 days ago It's like watching the scene in the wolf of Wall Street where Jordan and the Swiss banker are talking to each other, and then their voice overs in their head of what they really are talking about are talking to each other. Voice over: what I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over. Voice over: I understand perfectly, you American shit. permalink award report block reply clownworld30330 3 points 4 days ago can you ask me again without up-talking? I can\u2019t take you seriously if you up-talk Idk, might have said something like that.

Such Bigoted Pogs permalink award report block reply Steve56775 2 points 4 days ago Why do libtards end every statement like a question? It\u2019s really irritating. permalink award report block reply Jack_NC 1 points 3 days ago serious answer: because they are cowards and are looking for group consensus before expressing an opinion that could possibly violate the agreed narrative. In the liberal world,  agreement with the tribe is more important than factuality. permalink parent award report block reply Psalm-118_24 2 points 4 days ago Sweeney showing her \"white people \" intellectual superiority. \ud83d\ude01 permalink award report block reply Coin-Op 2 points 4 days ago Unpopular opinion: Sydney is just another glorified 304. One of the many hollyweird \"it\" girls that have had their 15 minutes of fame. Conservatives need to STOP with the beta simping. It's disappointing. permalink award report block reply Emodius 1 points 4 days ago What's a 304 permalink parent award report block reply LiveFreeInXorDie 3 points 4 days ago My guess is it's calculator code for \"hoe\". permalink parent award report block reply Coin-Op 1 points 3 days ago Winner, winner, chicken dinner! permalink parent award report block reply Coin-Op 1 points 3 days ago It's a euphemism for 'hoe'. Just type in '304' into a calculator, turn it upside down, and the spelling will set you free. permalink parent award report block reply LiveFreeInXorDie 1 points 4 days ago Yeah, she is. As I just replied to someone else, I don't care how based a prostitute is, I'm not going to put a ring on her or advocate anyone else to, and while Sweeney isn't literally a prostitute and by all accounts seems to be a decent person, she's happy to enable men to get their rocks off to her, i.e. mentally commit adultery. Not exactly a good role model for girls. I still respect her, but I'm sick of people simping for her just because she's not evil in Hollywood. permalink parent award report block reply TRexScrotum 1 points 4 days ago \u201cMentally commit adultery\u2026\u201d Are you fucking serious? So you walk around every day without looking at anyone else? How do you operate a motor vehicle? You\u2019re skirting shariah. That\u2019s an asinine statement you made. permalink parent award report block reply LiveFreeInXorDie 1 points 3 days ago \"But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\"  Matthew 5:28 I challenege any man to 100% honestly tell me that they can look at a nude pretty girl without getting lustful (therefore, adulterous) thoughts in their head. That's not sharia by the way, dipshit, that's just what Jesus taught. permalink parent award report block reply TRexScrotum 1 points 3 days ago Oh, with LUSTFUL intent.

Encourage your son to find a woman who doesn't need to show up to a sit down dinner black tie event naked and he probably will be happier for it. permalink parent award report block reply Coin-Op 4 points 4 days ago Good comment. Thank God not everyone on this site is a beta simp. permalink parent award report block reply lixa 6 points 4 days ago Thanks. In all honesty I am a woman- but I'm happy to admit when another woman is beautiful or has an amazing body (she certainly does and so do I lol), but I think women should value themselves and present themselves with decency in the public eye. Hypocrites here downvote me while they claim to want a godly woman.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f permalink parent award report block reply LiveFreeInXorDie 3 points 4 days ago You're entirely correct. To me, Sweeney isn't far from being a prostitute. She seems to be a decent person, a saint by Hollywood standards, but no matter how based a prostitute may be, she's still a whore. No self-respecting man should settle for an active, unrepentant whore. Unfortunately, 99.9% (i.e., 1/1000 odds) of women in America seem to be, at minimum, whore-adjacent, if not in promiscuity than in general unsuitablity for marriage. The more women I meet, the more I come to understand the last few verses of Ecclesiastes 7. permalink parent award report block reply\nCoin-Op 4 points 4 days ago Good comment.

Man... permalink award report block reply\nclownworld30330 5 points 4 days ago Look at the interviewers forehead: full of frowning lines. Look at Sweeney\u2019s forehead: no frowning lines at all!! And Sweeney has deep, pronounced laugh lines. Sweeney lives her best life every day. The interviewer is a miserable, deeply unhappy person. permalink award report block reply\nHikedelics 5 points 4 days ago Trump showed everyone the way to handle this shit 10 years ago.

As I just replied to someone else, I don't care how based a prostitute is, I'm not going to put a ring on her or advocate anyone else to, and while Sweeney isn't literally a prostitute and by all accounts seems to be a decent person, she's happy to enable men to get their rocks off to her, i.e. mentally commit adultery. Not exactly a good role model for girls.
