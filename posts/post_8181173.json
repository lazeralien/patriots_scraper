They are good net tax contributors, but I also know that historically the Hmong people used to have a written language. Somehow along the way they devolved and lost the ability to write in their language. Eventually they started using the roman alphabet to phonetically recreate their spoken language but nobody knows what the original written characters even look like. In other words, they are the jungle Asians and not the smarter snow Asians. permalink parent award report block reply ModernKnight 67 points 2 days ago Oof, that chart hurts to look at.  The 52% of legal immigrants receiving benefits is horrible also.  We shouldn't have any gibs.  If gibs ARE to be had, though, all foreigners should be disqualified from receiving said gibs. Edit to add: I also do not, for a second, believe those housing assistance numbers. permalink award report block reply realPhantomFuck 41 points 2 days ago Seriously. WHAT benefit is a person who immigrates here just to leech? They are a net negative and should be removed Edit: I appreciate the responses and I know the why . It\u2019s just insane to me that this is accepted because they\u2019re \u201clegal.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t even be possible to get on assistance as a new citizen permalink parent award report block reply John_Smallberries 18 points 2 days ago They're a benefit to the democrat communists due to the swaying of census numbers. permalink parent award report block reply BlackPilledMAGA 8 points 2 days ago SCOTUS needs to clarify that immediately and permanently remove all illegals from the census count. Non-citizens were never intended to count towards congressional representation and federal funding. Once they no longer count towards federal funding or congressional seats all of the leftist politicians will drop them in an instant. The pandering will end forever. permalink parent award report block reply PROCIsAsshoe 11 points 2 days ago In response to your question, there are two answers -- A Democrats internal monologue: \"They'll vote Democrat forever!\" A Democrats public reply: \"They bring diversity and enrich our culture!\" permalink parent award report block reply SDsc0rch 10 points 2 days ago some people work for a living some people VOTE for a living (!!!) permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 5 points 2 days ago It's a benefit to them because while you study hard and pray you'll get a job so you can afford a house and family some day, they drop three kids and make you pay for it. Its a benefit to the Uniparty since they cannot control our minds as effectively anymore so need to replace us. permalink parent award report block reply 420praiseit894 3 points 2 days ago And social security will turn into an avalanche when our population stabilizes or starts decreasing, because it's a pyramid scheme.

And the numbers should be based exclusively on the labor needs of the nation. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 2 points 2 days ago No never. The should all be sent back period.

If they want out, get a real job. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 8 points 2 days ago I'd be okay with someone on gibs losing their right to vote until they are once again independent permalink parent award report block reply Aquamine-Amarine -5 points 2 days ago Slippery slope. Lots of people here want to steal voting rights. It's a bad idea. Requirements for welfare should be really strict. The amount you get should depend on your situation. Single people can get money, obviously not as much as a family though. Single mothers should NOT get any money unless they're married to the kid's father. They take advantage of the system too much. Young adults taking care of younger siblings because their parents are dead can get money for the kid. Illegals get absolutely nothing. Deport. permalink parent award report block reply GodSaveTheWest 8 points 2 days ago Wrong, every single dumb fuck having voting rights was never the intention of the founding fathers. The greeks knew it was dumb too as they were theorizing democracy. There absolutely should be restrictions on who can vote. Muh slippery slope isnt an argument here, its how it was meant to be. You should have to be a tax payer to have a say how our government spends tax money. Not be on public benefits as you'll just vote for more free stuff. Not have certain kinds of debt as you'll just vote for however promises to forgive it. Have signed up for the draft (women signing up being optional. if they want to vote equally, they can risk dying in war equally.) In addition to that there should be a basic test when registering to vote. Too many idiots voting with no idea how our government even works or any knowledge of history or economics. permalink parent award report block reply ModernKnight 6 points 2 days ago Universal franchise was a bad idea.  The founders knew it.  \"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\"  Remove ALL gibs, or get those receiving them off the voter rolls. permalink parent award report block reply TheThreeSeashells 4 points 2 days ago I'd rather start with mandatory drug and alcohol testing, no smoking, and zero tolerance when those rules are broken.  Sorry, but if you're taking my money, you don't get to waste it on things you don't need, most of which will only lead to negative actions resulting in more theft of taxpayer money. I'd also be willing to throw in that they lose some benefits if they give birth.  Once again, if you need government handouts to survive, you shouldn't be making it harder to survive without taking more government money.  The \"childbirth\" clause could be offset should the recipient at least get a part-time job. permalink parent award report block reply ColbyP 3 points 2 days ago Taking away voting rights is both good, and consistent with the Founder's philosophy. They didn't write in everyone being allowed to vote in the constitution for good reason: many people shouldn't be allowed to. They didn't believe that the dregs and leeches of society should have a say, and would be ashamed that we ever gave them one. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... throttlejohnson 6 points 2 days ago also the 39% US born on welfare is fucking sad... permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 6 points 2 days ago Not as sad as the fact that the majority of fucking people who come to this country are leeches! permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 2 points 2 days ago 39% of US born households are on some kind of welfare though.

Too many chain migration recipients take advantage of the U.S. welfare. permalink award report block reply keeman 2 points 2 days ago It accomplished showing some of us actual conservatives that the R party will declare victory when passing an extension of the previous D administration's cartoonishly bloated budget.  R party has both houses of Congress, the presidency and SCOTUS and best we can do is just block the Ds from increasing spending ever further and then congratulate ourselves on how amazing we are. permalink award report block reply LiveFreeInXorDie 2 points 2 days ago Found the sauce: https://cis.org/Report/Welfare-Use-Immigrants-and-USBorn permalink award report block reply SanityGumby 2 points 2 days ago Exactly.

Low info voters are being bombarded by the media telling people it is the GOP cutting SNAP and hiking Obamacare prices. The right needs to get the message out that the ACA subsidy debacle was built into the original bill, and roll out all the Obama promises. permalink award report block reply Aoikaze2000 2 points 2 days ago Y'know, time for dual citizenship to end.

I think that they are at near parity with a slight lead and momentum for the new media. IMHO I think more Americans learned more about how bad Obamacare is and the level of fraud in it.  And because the Dems stretched the shutdown to threaten SNAP benefits and now that was exposed  to even more Americans. Dems are trying to spike the football over winning 2 blue states and a deep blue city.

And because the Dems stretched the shutdown to threaten SNAP benefits and now that was exposed  to even more Americans.
