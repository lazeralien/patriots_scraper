  "content": "73 After Charlie Kirk's assassination everything changed. Suddenly, TPUSA is getting captured by the messianic Christian wing. Kirk was not interested in Israel and was actually frustrated by the latest Gaza war and the human toll. Seems like the Trump administration knows more than they say. posted 4 hours ago by breadbaker 3 comments award share report block .\n3 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save PMSocks 8 points 2 hours ago Jews will destroy an organization that claims Christ is King permalink award report block reply fightfightfightx 2 points 2 hours ago When the Bible tells you in Revelations that the Synagogue of Satan is the final boss, believe it The Holodomor, perpetrated by jews, was 4-5x worse than the holocaust.

Every human being is capable of both great good and great evil. Lucifer\u2019s tactics work by exploiting that truth. He doesn\u2019t need to turn people into monsters overnight. He only needs to shift their perception, twist their understanding, and make them believe that evil is actually moral, rational, or even compassionate. When that happens, his work is done for him. Here\u2019s the breakdown of his main tactics: Twisting truth into half-truths.\nLucifer rarely uses pure lies. He mixes truth with distortion so it sounds reasonable. For example, he\u2019ll take Israel\u2019s military actions, remove all context, and feed the world a story that paints defense as aggression. It sounds logical until you examine what\u2019s missing. He did the same thing in Eden when he said, \u201cDid God really say?\u201d It was not outright denial, but distortion. Exploiting human pride.\nHe convinces people that they are morally superior to God\u2019s Word. Pride blinds people into thinking they can define justice, love, and truth on their own. This leads entire movements to believe they are fighting for peace or equality while actually working against divine order. Pride is his favorite tool because it creates moral blindness. Using empathy without truth.\nLucifer weaponizes compassion. He knows people naturally feel sympathy for suffering, so he presents one side of a conflict as victims and the other as villains, even if reality is the opposite. He pushes people to feel rather than discern. That\u2019s how he gets believers and unbelievers alike to side with darkness thinking they are doing good. Dividing through identity and ideology.\nHe fragments humanity into opposing tribes, political, racial, religious, and economic, so that unity becomes impossible. The more divided the world becomes, the easier it is for him to steer people toward blame instead of repentance. Hatred of Israel fits perfectly into this pattern because it feeds multiple ideological camps at once. Corrupting theology.\nHe doesn\u2019t just attack through the secular world. He corrupts doctrine from within. He convinces pastors and teachers to spiritualize away Israel\u2019s role, to treat God\u2019s covenants as symbolic or obsolete. That weakens the believer\u2019s understanding of God\u2019s faithfulness and breaks the prophetic connection between Israel and Messiah\u2019s return. Desensitizing through repetition.\nLucifer understands that constant exposure dulls moral awareness. When anti-Israel bias floods news cycles, classrooms, and entertainment, it becomes normal. People stop noticing the deception because they\u2019ve heard it so often. Evil becomes ordinary, and that is one of his greatest victories. Turning good impulses into idols.\nEven noble causes can become demonic tools when they replace God\u2019s truth. Environmentalism, social justice, and humanitarianism are not evil in themselves, but when detached from God\u2019s moral foundation, they become vehicles for rebellion. Lucifer always prefers corrupted good over obvious evil. Every tactic hinges on one goal: to move people away from truth while convincing them they are enlightened. That\u2019s how he deceives nations into hating Israel, how he turns believers against one another, and how he sets the stage for open rebellion against God. It is psychological warfare on a global scale, but spiritual at its core. permalink award report block reply\nPMSocks 8 points 2 hours ago Jews will destroy an organization that claims Christ is King permalink award report block reply\nfightfightfightx 2 points 2 hours ago When the Bible tells you in Revelations that the Synagogue of Satan is the final boss, believe it The Holodomor, perpetrated by jews, was 4-5x worse than the holocaust.
