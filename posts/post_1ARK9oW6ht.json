So the more \"free shit\" a government hands out, the LESS its citizens donate to charity. And that's extremely unfortunate because the government is the worst possible entity to be handling charity.  It has no incentive whatsoever to restrict it. In fact, politicians are incentivized to get more and more people on the public dole so they can use that to get their votes. So what inevitably happens? Rampant abuse, just like we see today. That doesn't happen when charity is private and voluntary, because nobody in their right mind will just keep throwing money at someone that refuses to help themselves. Subjective judgments can be made, and they absolutely should be in the case of charity. Not to mention when it's private, the person paying the bills actually receives gratitude and they damn well deserve it. They're donating the product of their labor for your benefit instead of the benefit of their own friends and family. That fucking deserves a thank you. But when government does it, people feel entitled to the money. Christ, we even call them entitlement programs. How that term doesn't piss everyone off astounds me. permalink parent award report block reply squash1324 3 points 55 minutes ago Studies have been done, and the most generous people are Christians. permalink parent award report block reply dukeofdoorcounty 1 points 9 minutes ago When I knew my money was going to US citizens, I didn't mind donating to the local food bank.
