I'm not sure it's worse.  The Bible says that two men having sex is an abomination.  It says that a man who goes back to an ex-wife who has been with another man is an abomination. In either case it's an abomination. permalink parent award report block reply BidenShowerDrool 3 points 2 days ago It says that a man who goes back to an ex-wife who has been with another man is an abomination. Islam insists upon it and will not marry them unless the ex-wife has been nutted by some other Muslim. (This is just another  indicator it's a religion of Satan, only a demon revels in such degeneracy) permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 2 points 2 days ago umm, no.  The Bibles says about marriage \"Let no man rip asunder what God has joined\".   Christian marriage is lifelong.   There aren't any ex wives or ex husbands among Christians who are married to Christians.    Divorce and remarriage is not acceptable. permalink parent award report block reply lifeisahologram 2 points 2 days ago And those 4 \u201cmarried\u201d dudes all went back to their home to have a massive orgy with 16 more random dudes they invited via an open house on Craigslist. permalink parent award report block reply SpellingContable 1 points 2 days ago If those 4 men form a train (likely) there would be 3 'wives' and 3 'husbands'.

It was a provisional document by a couple of Italian bishops, not even cardinals and not a single one of them was part of the Vatican Curia. According to the 2005 Vatican instruction by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, \"while the church deeply respects the people in question, it cannot admit to the seminary or to Holy Orders those who practice homosexuality, have deeply rooted homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\" ^^^ That is not overturned by a handful of Italian bishops.  I will repeat AntiPope Francis' words that he said twice \"There is too much faggotry in the Church\".  It doesn't sound to me like faggotry is accepted.  It's still one of the five sins crying to Heaven for Vengeance.  The Catechism, every version since Trent, says homosexual actions are mortal sins. permalink parent award report block reply DelendaEstMarxismo 1 points 2 days ago Right and everyone should have stayed in the church where 58% of the clergy are gay and 80% in their most holy city are gay. \ud83d\ude44 \"first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.\" https://nypost.com/2019/02/14/80-percent-of-priests-in-the-vatican-are-gay-new-book/ https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/07/29/catholic-priests-its-empirical-fact-that-many-clergy-are-gay permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 2 days ago The book with that statistic was written by an old gay man.   I do not doubt that 80% of the curia is gay and there's a high rate of faggots in the bishoprics of Italy, especially around Rome, but that does not extend to the entire Catholic Church or even most bishops or priests.  It's well known that almost all big cities in western Europe, Canada and the U.S. have faggot bishops and cardinals but they are not the majority.   They are not the majority in their respective countries nor are they a majority worldwide. permalink parent award report block reply Rubicon47 1 points 1 day ago When Protestants say the Lord\u2019s Prayer they end it with \u201cFor Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever.\u201d Catholics do not say this EXCEPT while at Mass (it is said by the Priest). They (of course) pilfered from the Catholic Mass, misinterpreted and made an error,  then call it their own. It was mistranslated into the KJV during the reformation and it stuck.
