102 This is what it looks like for a young person to buy a house in 2025 vs. 1980

What’s the difference? Buyers in the 1980s were not competing against:

- Private Equity
- 150M new immigrants
- 30M illegals
- H-1B fraud
- Hedge Funds
- Older generations hoarding multiple homes posted 12 hours ago by PiratePatriotParrot 14 comments award share report block Benny Johnson @bennyjohnson • 13h This is what it looks like for a young person to buy a house in 2025 vs. 1980 What’s the difference?

My dad had my childhood home, bought in 1984, paid off in 5 years. And that was on a very run of the mill middle class income. He still lives there and pays half the property taxes that I do despite his house being bigger and on a lot 2x the size of mine. Even if they didn't pay it off early, 1985 was already on the downward side of interest rates. If they had ARMs, they were getting downward adjusted basically the entire time. You could not have picked a better time to take a 30 year ARM. permalink parent award report block reply UNfreeNewZealand 1 points 5 hours ago Hoarding homes? Holy cow, every man and his dog was touting real estate in the ‘80s as the “ultimate” investment.

National debt was $2trillion(1/2 of GDP!!!!!), interest mortgage rates were 11.5%, and inflation was 3.5%.

The current year-over-year trend is a reduction of second home ownership.  The demographics of the multiple homeowners is more wealth based rather than generational. permalink award report block reply JeetPoopDo 1 points 4 hours ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink award report block reply
