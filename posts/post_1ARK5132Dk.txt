The sleepy but mostly OK people moved out of NYC between 2020 and 2022.  The only people left are the absolute morons. permalink parent award report block reply Oldman1234 17 points 6 days ago Better leave the city now before Mamdani institutes an "Exit Tax" where you must pay a special confiscatory tax to move elsewhere. Since February 2025, Gov Newsom has been pushing an "exit tax" or "departure tax" to fine (tax) people who move out of California. That's the mindset of the Democrat Socialist Left... take your money if you try to flee for a better life elsewhere.  Expect Mamdani to do the same in New York City. https://www.taxesforexpats.com/articles/expat-tax-rules/california-exit-tax.html permalink award report block reply TheTelltaleFly 8 points 6 days ago Soon they’ll have to build walls to keep people in.

NYC public school shariah was their tipping point. permalink award report block reply Jack_NC 10 points 6 days ago It's a reflection of just how bad the schools are these days that in some ways shariah and a muslim takeover would improve the quality of education. It seems like pro-LGBTQIA+ propaganda infects almost every class and subject, and the muzzies won't tolerate that faggot propaganda. To the downside, the legions of faggot teachers and their "allies" may flee to other states.

The only way to ensure that, are state constitutional amendments.

All I’ve ever seen since the 80s is all black classrooms with all black teachers. permalink award report block reply Ghostphaez 2 points 6 days ago Almost zero in the public schools, except in pockets of Queens and Staten Island. The few White families (most Whites in NYC are single) in NYC tend to send their kids to private schools. permalink parent award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 2 points 6 days ago Good, hope this is the start of an absolute exodus. The money that schools get is based on how many butts are in the seats, so they'll lose money if this is true. Since teachers and school administration is almost exclusively far left, it'll punish the exact right people. permalink award report block reply ParadigmShift2070 2 points 6 days ago https://x.com/jewishvoicelive/status/1985907537447878820 permalink award report block reply BeekeepingPatriot 2 points 6 days ago Cede the land why don’t you permalink award report block reply CocaineNewsome 2 points 6 days ago So where were they during voting time? permalink award report block reply PatriotDescendant 1 points 6 days ago Silly, he won't have any impact on the schools for many moons. permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 2 points 6 days ago When 9/11 happened, the DC sniper too, kids were stuck in the schools ," for their safety". Parents weren't allowed to pick up their kids even though there was no learning happening. Now when things like that happen parents know they have to go get their kids as soon as they see something on the news because otherwise schools act like they're in charge over the parent. permalink parent award report block reply Protonboy 1 points 6 days ago Spending for schools will go down, while taxes will remain the same, as well as state/Federal grants for schools. permalink award report block reply MorningFrost 1 points 6 days ago This guy is thanking the cheaters by saying these stupid people are about to pay.! permalink award report block reply monkadelic 1 points 6 days ago Well maybe housing WILL be cheaper, nobody wants to live there. permalink award report block reply hillaryforprison 1 points 6 days ago This headline sucks, harms the credibility of everything else they publish. The communists cheated with him on the ballot twice while hiding the opponent and 'won' at night. So if this headline was honest they're saying that parents 'yanked' their kids out of a school that was operating late at night? permalink award report block reply jermzdeejd 1 points 6 days ago As much as I didn't want Zohran to win...it has to happen. It is the only path. You as a conservative cant explain to an egotistical liberal how he is a very bad idea.

greatpumpkin 4 points 6 days ago It’s time for Texas and Florida to pass some kind of law to restrict New Yorkers bringing their stupidity to our states when they flee the communist hell hole that their city is about to become. The only way to ensure that, are state constitutional amendments. Elections Budget Squatting Income redistribution Grants Personal liability Public recording Noise permalink award report block reply

covok48 3 points 6 days ago Are there any White kids in NYC schools anymore? All I’ve ever seen since the 80s is all black classrooms with all black teachers. permalink award report block reply Ghostphaez 2 points 6 days ago Almost zero in the public schools, except in pockets of Queens and Staten Island. The few White families (most Whites in NYC are single) in NYC tend to send their kids to private schools. permalink parent award report block reply

LordKuroTheGreat 2 points 6 days ago Good, hope this is the start of an absolute exodus. The money that schools get is based on how many butts are in the seats, so they'll lose money if this is true. Since teachers and school administration is almost exclusively far left, it'll punish the exact right people. permalink award report block reply

Parents weren't allowed to pick up their kids even though there was no learning happening. Now when things like that happen parents know they have to go get their kids as soon as they see something on the news because otherwise schools act like they're in charge over the parent. permalink parent award report block reply

hillaryforprison 1 points 6 days ago This headline sucks, harms the credibility of everything else they publish. The communists cheated with him on the ballot twice while hiding the opponent and 'won' at night. So if this headline was honest they're saying that parents 'yanked' their kids out of a school that was operating late at night? permalink award report block reply
jermzdeejd 1 points 6 days ago As much as I didn't want Zohran to win...it has to happen. It is the only path. You as a conservative cant explain to an egotistical liberal how he is a very bad idea.
