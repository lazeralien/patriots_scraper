She is so sharp and you can tell she has that fire and anger inside of her at the way the media handles Trump and his administration. You can't really have a dude up there anymore because the very first time they ever get aggressive at a stupid ass reporter a question, it's just going to be claimed that they are bullying her or being misogynistic or what the fuck ever.

We all knew this would be short term pain for long term prosperity. However, you can\u2019t lie to the American people. Just flat out say hey the wheel on this ship is turning but it\u2019s slow. Come ask us next year. Because let me tell you, the gen z boys are about out of college and they\u2019re ready to start rebelling if there isn\u2019t a job and a family waiting on them. We are in a very dangerous time and we\u2019re in the run up to a massive conflict of communists vs right wingers and it needs to be full tilt on jobs income and babies for the next 12 months. No sojourns into the Middle East. No more foreign peace deals. This country first and only. permalink award report block reply MAGABOND 15 points 5 days ago Those GenZ kids need to be told who it is those jobs are actually going to, as well as who their taxes are being spent on. We need to let president Trump know that we will not stand for outsourcing jobs, and ridiculous entitlements anymore. permalink parent award report block reply Maskurbator 1 points 5 days ago Yes, but Trump isn't doing himself any favors by slow walking the visa issue.

Drills, refineries, fuel/oil shipping companies, even gas stations. Reduce the costs of fuel at the source and it will cascade to everything else. Almost everything else will gradually come down, and by A LOT. Maybe it won't make your student debt go away, but it'll make all your other expenses go down (energy, food, travel) to make the other unimpacted things more bearable. permalink parent award report block reply load 3 more comments...

This originates from the Roman military practice of punishing a rebellious unit by executing one out of every ten men. permalink parent award report block reply LUXURY_USERNAME 1 points 4 days ago huh I thought it meant cut into 10 pieces permalink parent award report block reply ImYourHuckleberry24 -1 points 5 days ago Right?!

A pound of good butter is $13. Produce prices keep rising and rising. I love you President Trump, but this still needs to be fixed. permalink award report block reply CatalystForChange OP 0 points 5 days ago Only way I can think of prices coming down is having feds cut down interest rates. Because people have to pay their mortgage and rents to sustain, they can't reduce prices unless something gives. If they are offered lower rents and lower mortgages, they can think of reducing prices. I doubt government can do anything else other than reducing fed interest. permalink parent award report block reply SirPokeSmottington 1 points 5 days ago DECIMATED! TO REDUCE BY ONE TENTH....

Im curious to how tied these layoff announcements are with low interest loans from 3-5 years ago needing to be refinanced at now higher rates. permalink parent award report block reply Atruckdriver 1 points 4 days ago Prices will NEVER come down. The dollar has lost value because so much is being \u201cprinted\u201d. More money is printed when the interest rates are lowered. Low interest rates equal easier debt creation (money printing). The ONLY way to lower costs is through deflation. permalink parent award report block reply SigSauer1776 1 points 5 days ago lol decimated is a strong word permalink award report block reply SirPokeSmottington 0 points 5 days ago And improperly used.
