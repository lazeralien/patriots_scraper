They're smarter than you.  They're smarter than me.  We got smart dedicated people working on this\".    He didn't.  It was a hodgepodge of left wing Democrat fantasies rolled into a huge Act that no one read because there were no smart people working on it.   Ted Kennedy, before he died, was one of the biggest backers of Obamacare.  He put a whole section into the Act that no one has even tried to implement because it would bankrupt the entire medical sector of the economy.  It's regarding a right to assisted living, nursing homes and in home care.   It's actually in the act, but no one has even attempted to implement even one part of it so far. permalink parent award report block reply Sparkywalnutz 5 points 4 days ago \"Grandma can't get a new hip, We'll just give her a pill for the pain.\"\n\"Oh, he's so charming!
