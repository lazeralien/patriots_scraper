143 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save RuleoVicus 169 points 4 days ago Why wasn't she arrested? Ask we ever do is embolden these motherfuckers. permalink award report block reply VanDeKoik 61 points 4 days ago Because these guys are on other business and dont have the time. But they have her plates. They have her license. They will be paying her a visit later permalink parent award report block reply 1_Badcop 64 points 4 days ago They need to make the time. This is basic broken windows policing stuff. permalink parent award report block reply 3percenterFan 10 points 4 days ago The local (Soros) DA will work hard(ly) on the case. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 5 points 4 days ago Its a federal arrest. permalink parent award report block reply Moose_Antlers 8 points 4 days ago The cops got her. She was terrified. So much of this behavior progresses because these people think there are no consequences. She was just informed otherwise. There are consequences. These cops are feds escorting a motorcade. They really don't have time to be screwing with some cat lady, or waiting for locals to show up and actually enforce this. If they can achieve the result of correcting the behavior without destroying her life, why not? If she does it again, she's now in a report saying she's been a problem before. No more leniency. Class matter here. If this woman had been someone who looked the part of a revolutionary, I suspect it would have been taken more seriously. She looked the part of a Karen having an emotional outburst. This is sort of equivalent to a quick slap across her face to tell her to act right. That doesn't work with hardened criminals. So, I think she got leniency accordingly. permalink parent award report block reply MadRussian 10 points 4 days ago But we need to destroy their lives just as they destroyed ours for years. Fuck the moral high ground, make it so painful their grandchildren feel it. permalink parent award report block reply BrewSwillis 8 points 4 days ago I bet she didn't think a single one of the J6 fraudulent election protesters deserved any leniency. I bet she thought the grandmas waving flags at the Capitol deserved to die in federal prison, for not wanting their elections hijacked. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... BillyBobBrewer 2 points 4 days ago Fuck that. She needs to do about 20 years. permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch 2 points 4 days ago No, I think they should go back to her house and punish her severely.  Not anything that would affect the child.  Something like community service and an ankle monitor that has a very bright light that shames her to everyone This cunt interfered with POLICE you cannot do that You just cannot cannot do that. We put meemaws in solitary.   Just because "i'm literally shaking i'm a mom"  she needs to be explained that if she were a single dad she'd go to prison be raped, lose the house, lose the kid, lose all the money and end up killing themselves.  But gee. ...you're a girl and we're nice so that won't happen to you Bullshit.  She needs to be strung up and lashed until she vomits Then they collect the vomit and pour it into her eyes permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 1 points 4 days ago without destroying her life, why not? pussy nigga that's the point to fuck up people who are doing this shit permalink parent award report block reply Lamal 4 points 4 days ago I think they know what they are doing.
In any case our opinion just looking at this video is incomplete, we don't even get to see what the initial crime was permalink parent award report block reply AppalachianTactical 1 points 4 days ago Call in another unit. Arrest her. Other business is why they failed to arrest illegals all along and will never stop being targeted because they never remove the bad guys. permalink parent award report block reply corporateshizer 37 points 4 days ago You know exactly why. We don't have a real conservative government. We have a government that is uni-party, globo-homo but wants to LARP like they are conservative. permalink parent award report block reply AppalachianTactical 1 points 4 days ago Absolutely. Whole movement is failed and subverted.
The ones with principle are moving on to AF and the neocon magas that are left are just acting like 2016 liberals.

I have no idea but people get off with warning for traffic violations all the time. permalink parent award report block reply prayinpede 8 points 4 days ago It's usually women. My gf has gotten out of so many tickets. She thinks laws don't apply to people. I was getting my oil changed one day. It's not too far from the range I go to. Do I figured id go afterwards. She happened to work at a school no too far from mechanic. She wanted me to stop by and meet her coworkers. She was so confused and mad that I didn't want to drive my car full of guns and ammo on a school campus. permalink parent award report block reply Awan-CIA-Car-Lot 6 points 4 days ago She happened to work at a school Because of course she does 😅  Be cautious, fren. permalink parent award report block reply glow-operator-2-0 3 points 4 days ago Your GF sounds unaware.

No? Then STFU, ICE doesn't have traffic enforcement authority. permalink parent award report block reply glow-operator-2-0 2 points 4 days ago Endangering a schoolbus like that should be enough for a license suspension for 12 months. permalink parent award report block reply BrewSwillis 1 points 4 days ago I don't believe federal agents have any authority over traffic violations. If she was harassing other federal agents, or interfering, then they would be able to arrest her. She'll probably end up suing the federal government for scratching/denting her $80K electric Mustang SUV. permalink parent award report block reply ManOfThePeople 27 points 4 days ago "I have kids." If that's the case, she wasn't thinking of them up until they became a convenient excuse, but she will keep them because there are no repercussions for her actions. permalink award report block reply RustySheckelford 9 points 4 days ago If only she cared about the kids on that bus as much as she supposedly cares about her children permalink parent award report block reply TearsAficionado 6 points 4 days ago Pay her kids' school a visit with clear ICE identifiers on the uniforms, then let everyone there know loudly that she is the reason for their visit to the school. permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch 2 points 4 days ago Anyone who uses "i have kids" as a human shield for criminality gets to do that exactly one time. They do it again and CPS takes the kids away, along with 90% of your holdings which go into an irrevokable trust for the child/children, whom she never sees again You don't get to use your children as a human shield for your malbehavior I need to leave this post, I'm getting meaner and angrier at this bitch by the second permalink parent award report block reply CrickleCrick 26 points 4 days ago She already has her stupid fucking whistle.

It's both sexes people. permalink award report block reply corporateshizer 10 points 4 days ago Nah, he gave her a "final warning" at the beginning, before the fake tears. The Federal government has shown little interest in prosecuting the radical left in any meaningful way. In comparison to how J6 patriots and other patriots were treated by the feds under Biden and Obama, it's just sickening. permalink parent award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 9 points 4 days ago Fuck off with that... She went from fearless ICE disruptor to sobbing little bitch in 2.3 seconds. Typical female manipulative sociopathic behavior. permalink parent award report block reply Lady_MaGa 9 points 4 days ago And he went from wanting to arrest her to letting her go, even with proof of crimes. Typical weak man syndrome.   It's why honeypots are out there in the world of politics and other arenas.  Both sides have their strengths and weaknesses. permalink parent award report block reply Aquamine-Amarine 2 points 4 days ago Absolutely. permalink parent award report block reply Username_here 9 points 4 days ago This person wouldn't do this  stuff if she couldn't post about it. The leftists who do  this stuff do it for selfish reasons. They want to raise their status in their leftist peer group. They don't actually care about illegals.

Here is a new executive order: Executive Order on Protection of Federal Border Enforcement Personnel
By the President of the United States of America
A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and all federal border security agents perform essential duties to secure our nation’s borders; and
WHEREAS, any interference with these officers endangers public safety and national sovereignty;

The punishment shall be administered immediately following conviction in a public square designated by the Department of Homeland Security and broadcast live on national television. No exceptions. No appeals beyond initial trial.
Section 3. Enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice shall ensure swift investigation, prosecution, and execution of this penalty. All proceedings and punishments shall be mandatorily broadcast live on every major network and streaming platform to maximize deterrence.
Section 4. General Provisions. This order is effective immediately and shall remain in force until repealed.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this [date] day of [month], in the year of our Lord [year].

(The car in the video is from a separate product line of Mustang-branded EVs,  made alongside the traditional Mustang) permalink parent award report block reply Hikedelics 5 points 4 days ago Unrelated, but I thought you guys would know if anyone does. Thursday I was driving home from work. Going North on I25 near Loveland, CO if it matters. Anyways I pull up alongside the totally unassuming red minivan kind of vehicle. Probably a Kia or Hyundai or something. Like I said, totally innocuous looked like the most boring generic family vehicle you could imagine. Only person you could see in the car was the driver, a dude probably in his early 40s and fit. What finally stood out to me though was the plastic divider right behind the front seats. It looked like something you’d expect in a cop car. The vehicle had zero markings and plain ol’ CO plates. Please tell me that was an ICE vehicle. If so, it was PERFECT!!! permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 3 points 4 days ago Many such vehicles in videos lately permalink parent award report block reply ingrowntoenail 1 points 4 days ago Could be to keep pets from going up front. permalink parent award report block reply Hikedelics 1 points 4 days ago I’ve seen those before. I’m not sure how to describe it here, but it was obvious to me that it was meant to keep out people rather than than anything else. It wrapped around the back of the front seats such that there wasn’t so much as a half inch gap to exploit anywhere. And it was substantially thick. My wife saw it and thought that maybe it was like what you’d see in some cabs, but this thing looked like it could have been bullet proof. From >6ft away you’d have no idea it was anything other than an ordinary minivan that most people wouldn’t give a second glance to. Up close it looked like the perfect vehicle to sneak up on and securely haul away ~4 hombres. permalink parent award report block reply npc_1234 1 points 4 days ago The taxis in NYC all have those partitions too, so it could hypothetically also be some sort of taxi or rideshare. permalink parent award report block reply MagaJay02 5 points 4 days ago Total and complete whack job.

I can't tell but they don't look to be patrol officers. Don't think ICE has the power to enforce MV law.  If that's the case, should've called local unless. . . oh, my bad.  Local may not be "cooperating" with ICE. It's all so tiresome. permalink award report block reply equiv222 3 points 4 days ago UNACCEPTABLE.

No, you don't have to put a single mom in jail and ruin her child's life. YES, you have to fine her 10k dollars and put an ankle monitor on her that is LARGE and has led lights on it that blink really bright so that you can see them through any pant leg and cannot be hidden. This ankle monitor allows her to go to work and to home and the nearest grocery ONLY (and church by request).  They draw a sophisticated geofence to allow her to do this. She has to wear it and bascially be on semi house arrest for 1 yr It honks like a retarded goose when she goes outside the lines, but it also honks when she's out with friends, randomly It's there to shame her like Hester Prynn with a scarlet letter stapled to her fucking criminal ass retard shitmom face permalink award report block reply wolfsettler 2 points 4 days ago "I'm worried about my community."

A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and all federal border security agents perform essential duties to secure our nation’s borders; and
WHEREAS, any interference with these officers endangers public safety and national sovereignty;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, [President's Name], by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby order:

Hikedelics 5 points 4 days ago Unrelated, but I thought you guys would know if anyone does. Thursday I was driving home from work. Going North on I25 near Loveland, CO if it matters. Anyways I pull up alongside the totally unassuming red minivan kind of vehicle. Probably a Kia or Hyundai or something. Like I said, totally innocuous looked like the most boring generic family vehicle you could imagine. Only person you could see in the car was the driver, a dude probably in his early 40s and fit. What finally stood out to me though was the plastic divider right behind the front seats. It looked like something you’d expect in a cop car. The vehicle had zero markings and plain ol’ CO plates. Please tell me that was an ICE vehicle. If so, it was PERFECT!!! permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 3 points 4 days ago Many such vehicles in videos lately permalink parent award report block reply ingrowntoenail 1 points 4 days ago Could be to keep pets from going up front. permalink parent award report block reply Hikedelics 1 points 4 days ago I’ve seen those before. I’m not sure how to describe it here, but it was obvious to me that it was meant to keep out people rather than than anything else. It wrapped around the back of the front seats such that there wasn’t so much as a half inch gap to exploit anywhere. And it was substantially thick. My wife saw it and thought that maybe it was like what you’d see in some cabs, but this thing looked like it could have been bullet proof. From >6ft away you’d have no idea it was anything other than an ordinary minivan that most people wouldn’t give a second glance to. Up close it looked like the perfect vehicle to sneak up on and securely haul away ~4 hombres. permalink parent award report block reply npc_1234 1 points 4 days ago The taxis in NYC all have those partitions too, so it could hypothetically also be some sort of taxi or rideshare. permalink parent award report block reply

5DchessWatch 2 points 4 days ago SHE GOT OFF EASY It's very unfair.  No, you don't have to put a single mom in jail and ruin her child's life. YES, you have to fine her 10k dollars and put an ankle monitor on her that is LARGE and has led lights on it that blink really bright so that you can see them through any pant leg and cannot be hidden. This ankle monitor allows her to go to work and to home and the nearest grocery ONLY (and church by request).  They draw a sophisticated geofence to allow her to do this. She has to wear it and bascially be on semi house arrest for 1 yr It honks like a retarded goose when she goes outside the lines, but it also honks when she's out with friends, randomly It's there to shame her like Hester Prynn with a scarlet letter stapled to her fucking criminal ass retard shitmom face permalink award report block reply
