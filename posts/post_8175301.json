That is if they can complete the investigation without rando hitmen walking into buildings in NY looking for \u201cthe NFL commissioner\u201d. I wonder if that was Wesley Lapatner\u2019s code name when she turned states evidence. permalink award report block reply Bramage 34 points 5 days ago The doj is waiting to fuck GEOTUS again after he leaves office. permalink parent award report block reply Andover 13 points 5 days ago Perhaps we should stop giving away trillions to lsraeI, billions to Ukraine and billions to Argentina? The $40 billion to Argentina was called an \"investment\", but that's what they said when we gave Argentina $20 billion in 2015 and not a single dollar of that has been repaid. We'll never see any of that money again. As for lsraeI, yes - Trillions with T if you include not only all of the military aid they greedily snatch from us every year as they spin on Christian Americans in the streets of Tel-Aviv, but also the additional military expenses we spend support them (such as the deploying two aircraft carriers for them earlier this year) AND the indirect funding from all of their pro-lsraeI foundations AND the total costs of all their needless wars they rope us into (such as Iran for Netanyahu's WMD hoax). We pay for lsraeI's free healthcare and free college and all of their wars, while most of us can't afford gas and rent. While our Federal Reserve debt skyrockets like never before. Something needs to change quickly or we won't survive this, even if it makes Miriam Adelson and her $600 million votes unhappy. permalink parent award report block reply lostremote- -3 points 4 days ago Its taking you guys longer and longer to tell us how these things are Israels fault.

I've been reliably informed on this site that this is due to the fact that all young people are lazy, there were no cell phones in the 70s, and  young people are lazy.

The whole point is that it is a cheap food that could be made at home really easily for like $1 per serving, and instead these kids who have to check to make sure theres actually money in their account before they swipe, are paying like 10-12 and another 5-8 for a coffee and they're just going to be hungry again in an hour because theres no protein in it. Leading to them doordashing food 2 hours later.... The point is living beyond your means. You cant really afford to spend like $60 a day on food for one person if you make like 90k a year. Instead you have the receptionist at the law firm trying to live like theyre a managing senior partner. People like Dave Ramsey, Caleb Hammer, and other financial advice shows can get guests all day long who live like this and believe they deserve it and wont change a thing about their consumption habits. permalink parent award report block reply thearizonaindy 8 points 5 days ago I think it\u2019s partly because the bigger dreams are so far out of reach. When you\u2019re truly never going to be able to afford a house or retirement, what do you have to feel like you\u2019re really saving for? permalink parent award report block reply Hellsbells00 7 points 4 days ago Retards being bad with money aren't doing it out of nihilistic ennui. They're just retarded. I'm not defending the abysmal state of the housing market, either. Even for intelligent people that save, home ownership is not as easy as it was. But people living paycheck to paycheck pissing away money on garbage are fucking morons, and a huge percentage of the population lives like that. You need savings MORE in shittier economic times, when you're damn near obligated to maintain a car and a smartphone, and medicine is expensive. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

GTFOH permalink parent award report block reply ArtLife 3 points 4 days ago The reality is that is the practical mindset. People are nickel and diming themselves into the poorhouse. That said, the behavior of the crony capitalists makes it very difficult.

Once borrowers could take out 30 year mortgages, they could afford more, and prices went up.  It's hard to get good information on this though so if anyone has more details, please let me know. permalink parent award report block reply NoStepNovember 5 points 4 days ago 100% and even at a 6% mortgage, you are paying mostly interest for the first 10-15 years. It's not the banks offered 30 year loan to \"help the customer afford it\" it is they did it to increase their interest payments when most people  sell their house in 5-10 years. permalink parent award report block reply NonbinaryPotatohead 5 points 5 days ago LOL.

Things are like two feet from the street so that it looks like that scene from Brazil when you drive by. Some aren't just apartments they're like multiple connected houses, so they can get paid out multiple times on a single property. Things go for a million dollars or more and they're basically town homes. permalink parent award report block reply Zelda 1 points 4 days ago Because they passed this stupid affordable housing bill that forces communities to include affordable housing in all new developments. permalink parent award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 21 points 5 days ago Interesting.

Just like it was in 2021. There's a reason why OP left that info out. It's bullshit. Presidents have as much control over shit like this as they do the fucking price of oil. permalink parent award report block reply NomadicKrow2 2 points 5 days ago They control the price of oil very closely, it turns out. And OP \"left that info out\" because it charts by the decade you stupid fuck, up to the point where the median age surges to 40, then you get it year by year, because it was such a huge movement in such a short timespan compared to everything else. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

They're not able to save because everything else is too expensive, utilities, rent, groceries, insurance, automobile, etc. permalink award report block reply Donmartin 10 points 5 days ago You will need to factor in education loans that need to be paid off as well. This will add to the delay. This has increased significantly. Also some of the other items that contribute to cost of living may not have increased much in real terms like clothes and electronics. Even certain groceries if one is not brand loyal permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 7 points 4 days ago You're still having boomer brain thinking everyone has to dump 80k into \"college\". You should be able to buy a house when you're 18 and get married. Get rid of the foreigners. permalink parent award report block reply HeatherSwanson 10 points 5 days ago Blackrock and Blackstone happened. Private equity accelerated the hording of SFH, artificially inflating their value making it easier for leverage buyout of homes. Make it illegal to own more than one home. Period permalink award report block reply Patrick_Bateman 11 points 5 days ago An easier and less communist solution is to just prevent anyone other than individuals from owning single family dwellings. 95%+ of Americans would support that. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet_Tooth_Tony 2 points 4 days ago Such an easy work around to that through family members and friends. Give people the cash to buy homes for you essentially. permalink parent award report block reply Patrick_Bateman 1 points 4 days ago No, that's not an easy workaround. The tax implications of that make it basically pointless to even do it. permalink parent award report block reply ShitFromShinola 3 points 5 days ago They do that in communist countries, Komrad. permalink parent award report block reply Beaverstatemilitia 10 points 5 days ago I don\u2019t know I am I. The rental business and a lot of the people we talk to and rent to are very successful people who just don\u2019t want the headaches. We have lawyers engineers and even a doctor that rents from us. They want to be free to do shit like go to Europe and to the Bahamas. Go out to eat all the time. They drive really nice cars and don\u2019t care to have to take care of a house. So a lot of these people probably eventually grow up a little meet someone and want to settle down at a later date.

Prices doubled, even tripled in my neck of the woods overnight. Imported half of the world with H1B's. permalink award report block reply tpactionchasethevote 1 points 5 days ago What was the spotted owl lie? permalink parent award report block reply Donmartin 4 points 5 days ago It is not a single factor problem. Even though money printing is a macro problem. The time the current generation spends in schools have also lengthen and significantly inefficient. The money thus misallocated to school will delay ability to acquire a home. One major problem i feel is the strange brainwashing that has happened that people feel a need to congregate at certain urban centers thus pushing up the price in specific areas Yet America is huge with no lack of space with entire towns that are becoming empty. There should never be such a housing crisis if people are willing to change their mindset . Also jobs would need to be brought back and reallocated away from the usual cities. permalink award report block reply Beardicus 3 points 4 days ago As much as I despise Biden, and he did escalate the problem, there are are many regulations and financial institutions to blame for this problem. permalink award report block reply Zelda 3 points 5 days ago Holy flip we were 25.

I wasn't really ready before that. I didn't have the insight or the means to handle all that owning a home entails until I had a secure job and a defined future. So I don't know that the stats matter. What we really need to do is manage the speculation piece of home ownership and get Bill Gates, Vanguard, BlackRock and State street out of the game. permalink award report block reply cbonez416 2 points 4 days ago Your still in a war and yes we are 45 years behind the globalist commies.

Anything under 300k is either 100+ years old or would need some serious fixing up. permalink award report block reply tuaris 2 points 5 days ago You need a double income too. permalink award report block reply HockeyMom4Trump 2 points 4 days ago I see this another way. Back in the old days, the goal was to meet someone, buy a home, have children, work your job\u2026 These days, many young people appreciate mobility. They have flexible jobs. They can work from anywhere. They don\u2019t want to own a home. They like the freedom of being able to move around and travel and explore. They are getting married later. Having children later. I have an adult son. He does not want to own a home right now with maintenance and something anchoring him down. He likes freedom. He can rent an apartment with a nice pool, fitness center, no maintenance and when he is done working each day, he need not worry about lawn care or painting the kitchen. His job has flexibility so if he tires of the area he currently lives in he can easily relocate. Not everyone wants to own a home. Home ownership can be a weight and a burden. I look at this metric and can see that it is comparable to other measures that young people are now doing later, like marriage and children. permalink award report block reply UpvoteBot 2 points 4 days ago The housing prices skyrocketing began with people fleeing cities when working remotely became the norm. Why remain in a crappy little apartment in a city, when you could move to the burbs and buy a house without having to change jobs nor commute. Then you add 40,000,000 brown fucks who are here illegally. Those invaders all need a place to live so the government pays to put them into various housing situations, like the apartments left by the people I mentioned above. Now, the available inventory of housing is used up. Finally you have hedge funds buying up everything they can get their hands on placing the final nail in the housing affordability coffin.\nThe $2T spending didn\u2019t help, but the biggest problem for inflation, is all the extra people to house and mouths to feed. Illegal immigration is ABSOLUTELY the source of the majority of our financial problems right now. They don\u2019t add anything, they just take welfare and drive up prices be consuming inventories of everything. permalink award report block reply RedditIs4Retards 2 points 4 days ago I bought my first house at 28 in 2018 under trump. Could easily have bought it a few years sooner but unfortunately decided to wait to get married. Would have had a 3k Sq ft house on 10 acres for less than I paid for a 1300sq ft house on 1/4 acre. I cannot imagine buying my first house even with much better income.

We were 27 at the time. 4% on a $220k ranch house. In 2008, everything crashed and my wife lost her job due to no work. We went bankrupt and walked away from the house, foreclosure. We lived modesty for the next 10 years and rented a trailer for $500 a month from a family member. After our bankruptcy fell off, we began looking for a house to buy again. In 2017 we found a nice farm house for $150k on 2 acres. Even has a detached garage which i turned into my woodshop and where I work on my truck. 3% mortgage. The economy was booming because of Trump. We lucked out. Our mortgage is lower now and we're making 4x more money at work now then we were back then. Struggling for those 10 years to save and get back on our feet was hard work but we made it happen.

You cannot enslave young people with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, requiring them to make thousand dollar a month payments through their twenties and early thirties and expect them to be able to start families and buy homes. Average student loan debt is almost $40,000. If you graduated at age 22 with $40,000 in student loan debt, you pay $470/month until you are 32 to pay it off. That is ridiculous. The average student loan debt for graduate school is about $88,220. That's $1025/month, PLUS $470/month. For a doctorate it's $250,000. $2900/month. None of which has a hope in hell of being repaid because some fucking jeet with a fake degree he paid $1000 for will hire other fucking jeets with fake degrees. Student loans need to end NOW, the interest rate on outstanding balances lowered to zero, discharge in bankruptcy permitted, and repayment implemented by payroll deductions over the next 30 years (a $50,000 student loan with zero interest paid off over the next 30 years is only $138/month) with tax benefits for early payoff. permalink award report block reply thisaintitchief76 1 points 4 days ago Is that why I can't afford a home now?

PapaPepe 7 points 5 days ago Secondary properties that nobody lives in directly puts more pressure on the housing market as you are permantly taking one off of it for some Airbnb side money. It raises the prices for existing homes because it wouldn't be a good airbnb if it wasn't in a desirable area. It's the equivalent of another family of illegals coming over the border and occupying housing. It's like Black rock, Vanguard and the other big companies. You aren't just a small investor with a couple of properties, there are hundreds of thousands of you. So house prices go up, rent goes up because people can't afford the houses that have now doubled in price in 5 years and people who do have a house are having trouble because their property taxes are shooting up. Half of the country is currently struggling to make a rent or mortgage payment right now. The mortgage you are paying for both homes is probably equal to what someone would have to pay to buy just one of them today. It's never been more unaffordable to buy a home in this country. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... makersmarx 3 points 5 days ago As the housing affordability crisis deepens, Airbnb and Vrbo face backlash | CNN Business https://share.google/of7nOR6J8xOVB3Q0H permalink parent award report block reply Goozmania 2 points 5 days ago Fuck you.

They can work from anywhere. They don\u2019t want to own a home. They like the freedom of being able to move around and travel and explore. They are getting married later. Having children later. I have an adult son. He does not want to own a home right now with maintenance and something anchoring him down. He likes freedom. He can rent an apartment with a nice pool, fitness center, no maintenance and when he is done working each day, he need not worry about lawn care or painting the kitchen. His job has flexibility so if he tires of the area he currently lives in he can easily relocate. Not everyone wants to own a home. Home ownership can be a weight and a burden. I look at this metric and can see that it is comparable to other measures that young people are now doing later, like marriage and children. permalink award report block reply\nUpvoteBot 2 points 4 days ago The housing prices skyrocketing began with people fleeing cities when working remotely became the norm. Why remain in a crappy little apartment in a city, when you could move to the burbs and buy a house without having to change jobs nor commute. Then you add 40,000,000 brown fucks who are here illegally. Those invaders all need a place to live so the government pays to put them into various housing situations, like the apartments left by the people I mentioned above. Now, the available inventory of housing is used up. Finally you have hedge funds buying up everything they can get their hands on placing the final nail in the housing affordability coffin.\nThe $2T spending didn\u2019t help, but the biggest problem for inflation, is all the extra people to house and mouths to feed. Illegal immigration is ABSOLUTELY the source of the majority of our financial problems right now. They don\u2019t add anything, they just take welfare and drive up prices be consuming inventories of everything. permalink award report block reply\nRedditIs4Retards 2 points 4 days ago I bought my first house at 28 in 2018 under trump.

We were 27 at the time. 4% on a $220k ranch house. In 2008, everything crashed and my wife lost her job due to no work. We went bankrupt and walked away from the house, foreclosure. We lived modesty for the next 10 years and rented a trailer for $500 a month from a family member. After our bankruptcy fell off, we began looking for a house to buy again. In 2017 we found a nice farm house for $150k on 2 acres. Even has a detached garage which i turned into my woodshop and where I work on my truck. 3% mortgage. The economy was booming because of Trump. We lucked out. Our mortgage is lower now and we're making 4x more money at work now then we were back then. Struggling for those 10 years to save and get back on our feet was hard work but we made it happen. Just good timing for us that we bought in 2017 I guess. permalink award report block reply\nMrMcGreenGenes 1 points 5 days ago Sure it's not Letitia James types dragging up the average? permalink award report block reply\nSaltyChad 1 points 5 days ago Correlation to age that people are getting married and having kids???

Who Were the 2010 First-Time Buyers?47% were under 30 (vs. 32% in 2009)\n60% used FHA loans (vs. 40% pre-crisis norm)\n28% received down-payment gifts (record high)\nMedian income: $62K \u2192 barely above 2000 levels (inflation-adjusted) Key Insight: This was a \"fire sale\" cohort, not a structural improvement. Many bought REO (bank-owned) homes at 20\u201330% discounts in exurbs (e.g., Phoenix, Las Vegas, Inland Empire).\nWhy the Age Dropped So SharplyOlder buyers (35\u201345) were underwater \u2192 couldn\u2019t sell to upgrade \u2192 locked out.\nYoung buyers had no prior home \u2192 no negative equity \u2192 could buy distressed assets.\nTax credit + low rates = FOMO \u2192 pulled forward demand from 25\u201329 y.o. renters.\nInvestor competition was low \u2192 institutions hadn\u2019t yet formed (Blackstone\u2019s Invitation Homes launched 2012).\nWhy the Age Dropped So SharplyOlder buyers (35\u201345) were underwater \u2192 couldn\u2019t sell to upgrade \u2192 locked out.\nYoung buyers had no prior home \u2192 no negative equity \u2192 could buy distressed assets.\nTax credit + low rates = FOMO \u2192 pulled forward demand from 25\u201329 y.o. renters.\nInvestor competition was low \u2192 institutions hadn\u2019t yet formed (Blackstone\u2019s Invitation Homes launched 2012).

You cannot enslave young people with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, requiring them to make thousand dollar a month payments through their twenties and early thirties and expect them to be able to start families and buy homes. Average student loan debt is almost $40,000. If you graduated at age 22 with $40,000 in student loan debt, you pay $470/month until you are 32 to pay it off. That is ridiculous. The average student loan debt for graduate school is about $88,220. That's $1025/month, PLUS $470/month. For a doctorate it's $250,000. $2900/month. None of which has a hope in hell of being repaid because some fucking jeet with a fake degree he paid $1000 for will hire other fucking jeets with fake degrees. Student loans need to end NOW, the interest rate on outstanding balances lowered to zero, discharge in bankruptcy permitted, and repayment implemented by payroll deductions over the next 30 years (a $50,000 student loan with zero interest paid off over the next 30 years is only $138/month) with tax benefits for early payoff. permalink award report block reply\nthisaintitchief76 1 points 4 days ago Is that why I can't afford a home now?

It's the equivalent of another family of illegals coming over the border and occupying housing. It's like Black rock, Vanguard and the other big companies. You aren't just a small investor with a couple of properties, there are hundreds of thousands of you. So house prices go up, rent goes up because people can't afford the houses that have now doubled in price in 5 years and people who do have a house are having trouble because their property taxes are shooting up. Half of the country is currently struggling to make a rent or mortgage payment right now. The mortgage you are paying for both homes is probably equal to what someone would have to pay to buy just one of them today. It's never been more unaffordable to buy a home in this country. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... makersmarx 3 points 5 days ago As the housing affordability crisis deepens, Airbnb and Vrbo face backlash | CNN Business https://share.google/of7nOR6J8xOVB3Q0H permalink parent award report block reply\n10knotsorless -2 points 5 days ago Excuse me?
