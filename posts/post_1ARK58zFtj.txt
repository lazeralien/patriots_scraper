Would be a shame if Trump hit that commie hellhole with a 100% tariff. Furthermore, there is no doubt in my mind that a BBC video influenced more people than a few thousand dollars worth of Russian Facebook ads, so you can argue that the UK interfered in our elections more than Russia ever did. Perhaps some sanctions are in order on top of the aforementioned tariffs. permalink award report block reply 5854110203868847 1 points 4 days ago Cunting British fucks permalink award report block reply Yz450f 1 points 4 days ago Will the United States classify the BBC as a foreign adversary that attempted to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election? permalink award report block reply PatrioticVideo 1 points 4 days ago Apologize to deez. permalink award report block reply
