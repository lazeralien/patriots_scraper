Over 15 million Gen z was aborted. That\u2019s 1/3 of them. This is more murders than all homicides and war casualties in the history of the United States. I know no one here is paying attention to the groypers but they\u2019re dead set on repealing the 19th because this is just heinous behavior from our women. They literally rival Stalin for deaths. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 25 points 4 days ago I fucking hate what they're doing to my generation.

Look at the figurehead of Barstool -- he said that his vote will flip for Democrats if the Republicans push for restrictions on abortion. There was also that long-serving Republican Congressman Tim Murphy who persuaded his mistress into having an abortion. He resigned in 2017 and, by doing so, gave Democrats another seat in the House of Representatives. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 9 points 4 days ago Weak men follow what women approve of.

The vast majority of those babies were doomed the moment they were conceived because they were the product of a degenerate act.

Most men don't survive an abortion. Ba dum tis Siri, play in the arms of an angel! Jokes aside, I hope he meets a less haunted vagina.

It got me thinking about how people back then could rationalize human sacrifice to \u201cplease the gods\u201d to improve crops and stuff. Then I started thinking about how today there are women who sacrifice their unborn because of the belief that it will improve their quality of life in the future. And I wondered if it really is just that easy to get people to rationalize human sacrifice. permalink award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 11 points 4 days ago Watch Michelle Williams' acceptance speech for winning the Golden Globe Award for best actress.

It got me thinking about how people back then could rationalize human sacrifice to \u201cplease the gods\u201d to improve crops and stuff. Then I started thinking about how today there are women who sacrifice their unborn because of the belief that it will improve their quality of life in the future. And I wondered if it really is just that easy to get people to rationalize human sacrifice. permalink award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 11 points 4 days ago Watch Michelle Williams' acceptance speech for winning the Golden Globe Award for best actress.
