Those two need to fix this shit. Trump needs to quit putting his agents in danger if he's not gonna have their backs. It's getting out of hand and I'm sick of hearing about the abuse they are taking. permalink award report block reply possibletower 50 points 4 days ago I knew it was really weird when ICE/DHS/DOJ kept overhyping that one illegal faggot caught for throwing a rock at a passing ICE vehicle (that didn't even hurt anybody or cause much damage) and they stayed silent and did NOTHING when the very next day there were around 500 illegal aliens at the top of an overpass bridge dropping fucking 100 bricks and cinderblocks onto 20 LAPD police cars and hitting cops in the heads while escaping their vehicles. I was thinking \"why the fuck are Trump/Noem/Bondi not talking about this and why are they not arresting a single illegal alien that destroyed 20 cop cars and smashed at least 5 cops' heads with those bricks?\" permalink parent award report block reply mlp67 27 points 4 days ago I would not work for ICE if I had take this shit day after day. It's a disgrace. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 26 points 4 days ago They are being told to stand down, go try attacking a normal beat cop and see what happens to you. Trump doesn't want to give the left optics of ICE agents brutally crushing the protests, but at this point, it's what's needed because they are going to paint us as Nazis no matter what we do permalink parent award report block reply QueensOwn 22 points 4 days ago Don\u2019t use their \u201clanguage\u201d. This is NOT a \u201cprotest\u201d. Throwing objects, blocking federal officers and shooting guns is a full scale RIOT and just might be an insurrection if this type of violence is permitted l permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

Health problems we can figure out something for many.

The ignoring of laws by democrat commie mayors, the corporate violations of racism in dei and federal laws against discrimination...yet I saw democrats hunt down thousands of americans and locked unconstitutionally in cells for years for following police orders in DC.... WHERE ARE THE ARRESTS ?!?!?\nTeachers, politicians, doctors, officials, media heads, mayors, unions, filthy riggers, all of them WE ARE AT FUCKING 0 ARRESTS compared to the glacier that it should be We cant even arrest kid rapists arrested in Seattle... some have 37+ violent attacks and assaults on others ... dont tell me 0 arrests is innacurate... each category is basically at 0 arrests... permalink parent award report block reply Krat 2 points 4 days ago So 2 out of how many that need to be ? 100,000 ?

Its probably 60 % illegals permalink parent award report block reply spinometer2 -1 points 4 days ago shut up already. there is no President who has had the backs of LEO more than Trump EVER. permalink parent award report block reply Firespawn 1 points 4 days ago \"Trump's Administration\"\nPersonally sure, however, he's had people around him who had/have the ability to do better by all law enforcement but apparently, and unlike Trump, they didn't and don't give 2 shits about them.\nIf they did, they'd send support and also make sure that standing down wouldn't be an issue.\nI doubt anyone is saying that Trump himself doesn't have their backs. Relax a little. permalink parent award report block reply spinometer2 2 points 4 days ago you can see in the videos there are at least 10 very capable and heavily armed men conducting this operation. it would take a small army to truly challenge them. as far as going after the perps afterwards, we all know the justice system is deeply deeply deeply broken. that will not be fixed for many years as the 90% of bad guys either retire or are found out and fired. but get real - that's a 20 year operation. permalink parent award report block reply Firespawn 2 points 4 days ago Couldn't agree with you more.  But the people around Trump have to make that call and let them engage. That's why I say it will be in our hands where we will be the last defense when it's said and done.\nIt's sad what this beautiful country has become. If in the 70s-90s someone would have told me we'd end up here I'd have told that person that they were absolutely insane. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 16 points 4 days ago SCOTUS is mulling over whether the National Guard is needed. I really hope they consider this event as good cause to let President Trump send them in permalink award report block reply GBA4ever 1 points 4 days ago Chicago fake Dem news still reporting it as an \u201calleged\u201d attack. permalink parent award report block reply Bruno 14 points 4 days ago Imagine for a moment if all of this were reversed: We killed a leftist speaker on college campus We shot and tried to assassinate a Democrat president We opened fire on federal agents under a Democrat administration We called for more murder and mayhem and had the gall to have multiple NO KINGS protests The imbalance in this country is so astronomically baffling to me that I feel like I'm in an episode of the Twilight Zone. permalink award report block reply TerrorOfLiberals 4 points 4 days ago I see similar imbalances between genders. Men in our society get absolutely trashed at every opportunity, while we worship women like they're gods. As a society, we value womens comfort more than unborn babies lives. Women can literally kill babies, and they do, and the majority of people seem to like that. permalink parent award report block reply current_horror 2 points 4 days ago You\u2019re both describing the same thing. Democrats are the party of feminization. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 4 days ago -Gabrielle Giffords (2011) to say nothing of MLK.\n-JFK\n-Ammon/Ryan Bundy Oregon under the Obama admin\n-I mean if this site in any indication; though republicans are notoriously bad at protesting enmasse; the whole having jobs and families thing sometimes gets in the way. permalink parent award report block reply Hanging_Chad 12 points 4 days ago just kill the attacker permalink award report block reply MedicallyReddit 8 points 4 days ago This. Countless vids of city cops killing people but ICE can\u2019t kill literal terrorists? permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 2 points 4 days ago You'd think returning fire would be a trained reflex like in the army. permalink parent award report block reply ingrowntoenail 10 points 4 days ago Which is why they need to carry live rounds instead of fucking paint balls.  As soon as shots are fired against these federal agents they should start firing back. permalink award report block reply DefKon1 8 points 4 days ago This reminds me of when I was overseas in the Army and they would send us on guard duty during \"high alert\" to the base perimeter with nothing but a radio. This always made me wonder just how deep a breach in defense would become before an armed response could be made. By my calculations it would have taken a minimum of 5 minutes. A lot of damage can happen in 5 minutes. But...nobody paid me to think, so I guess I was  having illegal thoughts. I'm embarrassed of myself.\ud83e\udd37 permalink parent award report block reply Firespawn 3 points 4 days ago 5 minutes is longer than many people realize. Hand to hand combat can be grueling. 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc... Time flies when we're having fun, but when it's bad, it seems like it takes so much longer. permalink parent award report block reply DefKon1 2 points 4 days ago Yup. 5 minutes unchallenged is long enough to establish a foothold that could last hours or even days. Or worse. permalink parent award report block reply Firespawn 2 points 4 days ago They had live ammo in DC, but obviously never used it. I remember a reddit faggot named \"freebricks4nazis\" having a complete shit fit like an Indian retard over it. \ud83d\ude02 He was so triggered, I was laughing at every post. permalink parent award report block reply PatriotSkorzeny 10 points 4 days ago BP shouldn\u2019t have let the illegal aliens in. It\u2019s been nothing but grief. permalink award report block reply Build_Back_Bankrupt 5 points 4 days ago Mayorkas stood down on purpose and didn't back them, this should be taken to the top, dereliction of duty at the top levels. permalink parent award report block reply ragnarokrobo 5 points 4 days ago And they accepted his orders and executed them with gusto. Including giving out fistbumps to illegals coming across the border and welding gates open for them. permalink parent award report block reply Build_Back_Bankrupt 0 points 4 days ago I remember, a lot of them were worried about losing their jobs and benefits, I'm sure some were glad to do it, but I also remember stories of BP / ICE speaking out and/or quitting. I can't say if the orders were illegal, but it was a dereliction of duty, and was likely coordinated with NGO's which would be a conspiracy, possibly illegal. permalink parent award report block reply ragnarokrobo 4 points 4 days ago Uh huh.

Of course he'd get a lot of reposts/likes.

He is either holding violence provoked by ICE and retaliated by lefty radicals as a card until midterm elections or, the exact opposite, Trump doesn't want to inflame things more. The more nuanced approach: they are trying to create under the radar chaos and fear in lives of illegals so they leave and the arrests are as much toward that as get some really bad people out. permalink parent award report block reply spinometer2 -2 points 4 days ago DOOMERS GET OUT permalink award report block reply\nmlp67 138 points 4 days ago This is on Bondi and Noem.

I was thinking \"why the fuck are Trump/Noem/Bondi not talking about this and why are they not arresting a single illegal alien that destroyed 20 cop cars and smashed at least 5 cops' heads with those bricks?\" permalink parent award report block reply mlp67 27 points 4 days ago I would not work for ICE if I had take this shit day after day.
