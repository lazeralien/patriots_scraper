Hellsbells00 -1 points 4 days ago All you people crowing about it are the ones buying the media hype about \"AI\". It's not. It has no relation to the science fiction concept that is true artificial intelligence. It's a MASSIVE algorithm generating a barrage of vomit based on consumed data. It doesn't think, it isn't capable of understanding or novel thought or creation. And it will never be ablr to. The magic of AI is that it is supposed to be a mind, not a massive dead machine. These things being called AI, (they are not) aren't actually producing any value. They're propped up by billions of dollars, government backing, globalist cabal backing and venture capitalist funds and they're completely unprofitable, while producing no work that justifies their actual expense. Nor will they ever. permalink parent award report block reply view 6 more comments...

Before AI, restarting a decommissioned reactor was effectively impossible. Hell utilities can't even re-use the site of a previously halted reactor construction project, they have to start from scratch on a fresh site. Google and Microsoft make a few calls and suddenly the rules change to fit their needs. permalink parent award report block reply XxxRDTPRNxxX -1 points 4 days ago I don't like the idea of a full scale nuclear reactor though. There's been way too many disasters that have rendered huge parts of the world uninhabitable for thousands of years. I did see a design for small scale reactor that couldn't melt down, doesn't need maintenance and spends its entire functional life already in it's burial spot. They said one pod is enough to power like 10k homes. IDK maybe it was just some ponzi scheme to scam investors but they made it sound was more practical and safe than a full scale nuclear plant powering entire states. permalink parent award report block reply airgag 5 points 4 days ago Uninhabitable for thousands of years? They dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and people went back there in few years. Don't believe all the bullshit permalink parent award report block reply WeWillRideAgain 2 points 4 days ago Because those were air bursts. rock and dirt was not vaporized and irradiated and spread everywhere.

You can go to Chernobyl today with a geiger counter and measure the radiation. It's still there. permalink parent award report block reply view 13 more comments... Cubey 3 points 4 days ago Yes it's important to remember like airgag says, high intensity radiation can't last very long by its very nature. Short half life means it rapidly lose energy in those cases like the nuclear bombs. Places like Chernobyl while not ideal for human living is basically a nature reserve in its current state since the animals reproduce fine if even they get cancer after 13 years. permalink parent award report block reply XxxRDTPRNxxX 2 points 4 days ago Yeah, but that's still uninhabitable though.

A ton of these projects are built around the idea of selling extra energy back into the grid (I would bet they are even required on the back end to do it as part of getting permission to build these places). You get rich people to basically build new power infrastructure for the whole country; the rich guys get their data centers running exactly as they like; and the masses get very needed infusions of electricity into the grid. I don't think people grasp just how cheap electricity can get if they keep making these data centers. Especially as trillion dollar companies get a hold of nuclear power - do you think Google or X is going to just mail in their power generation??? No, they probably will revolutionize how mini nuclear reactors work, generating more and more power efficiently. The reason they never got into this subject before is simply because they weren't allowed to do so. The more I blather about it, the more it's hitting me how big a deal it is that our country is leading on all this. permalink parent award report block reply IntergalacticWalrus 1 points 4 days ago They're gonna find a way to upcharge the commoners. Make no mistake. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 3 days ago While I get your point and somewhat agree - the thing with large scale computing is the power demands increase rather then decrease over time. So while initially they might sell excess power to the grid; overtime they will not prioritize the public over the running of the beast in their AI datacenter which will result in rising power costs over time - especially if they cannot scale up their power generation and actually need to pull from the grid. Any word how long its going to take for them to spin up this reactor? permalink parent award report block reply lizardo221 1 points 3 days ago I can say with a lot of confidence they will probably never pull from the grid because they most likely will be required to be self sufficient. They probably will also be designed where their machines aren't allow to be directly connected to the grid. Think of it like \"grid - center - extra power\" vs \"grid - extra power - center\". By making the new generators the electric gatekeeper, you can prevent citizens' worries about the data center taking from the grid. Though it is very possible the centers could reach a point where they give little power back, that is possible. But even in that situation, I think our country will get comfortable enough by that point with spinning up new power that we will just add more to the power grid the old fashion way. As for when these new centers come online, I think it'll take several years. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... TrumpAndGodWin 0 points 4 days ago Power prices have already gone up on citizens and reduced for data centers. permalink parent award report block reply lizardo221 1 points 3 days ago For data centers currently online? Quite possible because they were set up before Trump took office. The ones currently running had to work on Biden/green shit rules, and they probably can fuck with the grid more. I don't know if any under Trump's administration are online yet - I'm saying any where they are permitted to be their own utility company and the data centers didn't exist yet. Like Elon having to use coal generators in desperation is very different from building nuclear reactors from scratch with the most modern of technology. permalink parent award report block reply GreyKnight 5 points 4 days ago People know their is a problem with the vast divide between the rich and the poor\u2026but they don\u2019t understand the scale of the difference\u2026 permalink award report block reply Trumpcoin2020 5 points 4 days ago Wow, that\u2019s cool but I\u2019m not too sure how I feel where this is going especially with the people that are in control or positions of power. Things could get dark really quick or some kind of Renaissance whatever. But I think I\u2019m being too optimistic from what I\u2019m seeing With AI which and a lot of people making money with it and I look forward to doing that as well, but people are just becoming more stupid. Seems like we\u2019re on the path of idiot Idiocracy. With a mixture of 1984 every other apocalyptic sci-fi film the list is endless to be honest now with how fast things are going and what they\u2019re able to do in the bio sector we\u2019re probably not that far off from zombies as well, so crazy. permalink award report block reply DrVSGGEOTUSPhD 1 points 3 days ago Repent, and Trust in Jesus ALONE as you savior Get in a good CHURCH Get in PRAYER Get in His Holy WORD Simple as.

You get rich people to basically build new power infrastructure for the whole country; the rich guys get their data centers running exactly as they like; and the masses get very needed infusions of electricity into the grid. I don't think people grasp just how cheap electricity can get if they keep making these data centers. Especially as trillion dollar companies get a hold of nuclear power - do you think Google or X is going to just mail in their power generation??? No, they probably will revolutionize how mini nuclear reactors work, generating more and more power efficiently.

They probably will also be designed where their machines aren't allow to be directly connected to the grid. Think of it like \"grid - center - extra power\" vs \"grid - extra power - center\". By making the new generators the electric gatekeeper, you can prevent citizens' worries about the data center taking from the grid. Though it is very possible the centers could reach a point where they give little power back, that is possible. But even in that situation, I think our country will get comfortable enough by that point with spinning up new power that we will just add more to the power grid the old fashion way.

You pro-nuclear fags keep wanting nuclear power, right? This is how it actually gets done. The way you want it to happen is not going to happen and a total waste of time to LARP like it will happen the exact way you want it to happen. They are building mini-nuclear reactors also, not the hugeass ancient tech nuke reactors. permalink award report block reply DefenderDad 1 points 3 days ago So you\u2019re against nuclear power?! permalink parent award report block reply\nDefenderDad 1 points 3 days ago So you\u2019re against nuclear power?! permalink parent award report block reply\nTheDarkEmperor 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\nrapskull 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply",
