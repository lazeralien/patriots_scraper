This is why he likes the Chinese money. ~60 Billion annually  is a sizable chunk of change for temporary scholastic visas. permalink parent award report block reply peterstrzoked 6 points 22 hours ago \u201cLosing\u201d $60B annually to remove 600k spies seems really cheap to me.

The article to which you linked says \"The U.K., which controls a number of intelligence assets in the region, has helped the U.S. locate vessels suspected of carrying drugs so that the U.S. Coast Guard could interdict them, the sources told CNN. U.K. leadership\u2019s decision means they will no longer direct the intelligence they collect to the Joint Interagency Task Force South in South Florida, which comprises representatives from partner nations that combat the international drug trade.\" So, this is not just a handful of \"anonymous whistleblowers\" and is definitely coming from the U.K. government.  It's actually odd that the article phrased it the way they did, except that it's poorly written. Other articles I've come across elsewhere are saying this is definitely coming from the UK government specifically because they are concerned that the attacks violate \"international law\" and they don't want to be considered complicit in the attacks. permalink parent award report block reply Yawnz13 3 points 24 hours ago So, this is not just a handful of \"anonymous whistleblowers\" and is definitely coming from the U.K. government. It's actually odd that the article phrased it the way they did, except that it's poorly written. Clearly not, as the article stated in the quoted section. Your quoted section does not preclude the previously quoted section.  The UK having intel assets in the region does not confirm nor deny the truth of LibsofTikTok, but it does show that she is willing to misrepresent the situation.  Until you have verifiable policy change from the UK government and not mere innuendo, all you've got is talk.  Talk is cheap. Other articles I've come across elsewhere are saying this is definitely coming from the UK government specifically because they are concerned that the attacks violate \"international law\" and they don't want to be considered complicit in the attacks. So link them then. permalink parent award report block reply TheThreeSeashells 2 points 24 hours ago Here you go: https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/11/11/cnn-uk-stop-sharing-intelligence-over-drug-smuggling-airstrikes-n2666269 The United Kingdom is no longer sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it does not want to be complicit in US military strikes and believes the attacks are illegal Oh, and that previous section you mentioned?  I didn't mention it because it's a non-statement: \u201cIt is our long-standing policy to not comment on intelligence matters,\u201d a U.K. government spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. \u201cThe U.S. is our closest ally on security and intelligence. We continue to work together to uphold global peace and security, defend freedom of navigation, and respond to emerging threats.\u201d However, right before that it says: The U.K. has joined an international consensus that Trump\u2019s decisive military action against the international drug dealers is illegal. If they're joining the \"international consensus\" that the military strikes are illegal, that backs the claims that the government is on-board with withholding intelligence.  Not just a few \"whistleblowers.\" Regardless, the Examiner article is still poorly written. permalink parent award report block reply Yawnz13 1 points 24 hours ago Here you go: https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/11/11/cnn-uk-stop-sharing-intelligence-over-drug-smuggling-airstrikes-n2666269 And take a look at their evidence:  A Twitter post from the Breakin911 account.  Said account engages in the same Twitter slop behavior and has presented the same amount of evidence to the claim as LibsoftikTok i.e. none. Oh, and that previous section you mentioned? I didn't mention it because it's a non-statement: That wasn't the \"previous section\" in mentioned.  Had you actually bothered to read my initial post for comprehension, you'd have seen that. There's also no such thing as a \"non-statement\".  That quote is support for the Washington Examiner's article, not LibsofTikTok or Breaking911. If they're joining the \"international consensus\" that the military strikes are illegal, that backs the claims that the government is on-board with withholding intelligence. Not just a few \"whistleblowers.\" Furthermore, since it's \"whistleblowers\", it shows that the UK wasn't officially sharing intel on the matter with the US anyway.  If they were, it'd be through official channels and not \"whistleblowers\". Incorrect.  One does not prove the other.  They can believe that what Trump is doing is wrong, but that doesn't prove that they have made any official policy on the matter.  Until you provide explicit policy on the matter, the Washington Examiner article holds true. Regardless, the Examiner article is still poorly written. According to what objective criteria?  Oh wait, you can't back that up either and are merely making the statement as an attempt to poison the well. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments...

I don't think Trump or anyone else in our idiotic government has the right to dictate what I can and can't ingest into my own body, the same way I don't think they have a right to tell me what I MUST ingest into my own body. The people who were opposed to vax mandates while simultaneously supporting drug prohibition laws have no leg to stand on. You granted government that right. You shouldn't bitch when it predictably backfires in your face. Besides, just like alcohol prohibition, the drug prohibition laws don't work anyway. The Narcotics Act was passed over 50 years ago, and more people do drugs now than they did when Democrats passed it. Nobody can claim those laws are \"protecting people\". The data show that to be entirely false. Besides, in a free society where the individual is superordinate to the state, it's not the responsibility of our SERVANTS in government to protect the individual from themselves. The war on drugs is a counterproductive abysmal failure. Downvote all you want. That won't make that statement any less true. permalink award report block reply Caine 2 points 18 hours ago This isn't like the Reagan-era war on drugs. Fentanyl is being sent here by China to kill as many of us as it can. permalink parent award report block reply OMC-RADIO 1 points 11 hours ago While I agree with body autonomy, a government with borders has every right and obligation to protect its people.  The narcotics industry is a black market, not recognized trade.  Allowing the narcos to sell their unregulated, untested products by crossing the US borders is funding the cartels who sell dangerous products that destroy lives and corrupt government officials.  The US has every reason and right to see the influx of such dangerous, destructive and deadly products as an assault against its people. While most people don\u2019t care what someone else puts in their mouth or body, they don\u2019t want to experience the direct or indirect effects of it either. permalink parent award report block reply NoFats 1 points 24 hours ago The UK needs to be put in its place. permalink award report block reply TearsAficionado 1 points 24 hours ago Confiscate their nukes.

I don't think Trump or anyone else in our idiotic government has the right to dictate what I can and can't ingest into my own body, the same way I don't think they have a right to tell me what I MUST ingest into my own body. The people who were opposed to vax mandates while simultaneously supporting drug prohibition laws have no leg to stand on. You granted government that right. You shouldn't bitch when it predictably backfires in your face. Besides, just like alcohol prohibition, the drug prohibition laws don't work anyway. The Narcotics Act was passed over 50 years ago, and more people do drugs now than they did when Democrats passed it. Nobody can claim those laws are \"protecting people\". The data show that to be entirely false. Besides, in a free society where the individual is superordinate to the state, it's not the responsibility of our SERVANTS in government to protect the individual from themselves.
