You pay mostly interest, very little principal on each payment. A better solution is to deport 30 million illegal aliens to bring down rent and housing prices.

A 50-year mortgage is RENTING. permalink award report block reply Pied-Trumper 5 points 3 days ago We voted for deportations, economic corrections, nationalism, etc. We got multiple foreign wars for the benefit of foreign nations, $2k stimulus checks, 50-year mortgages (you pay nearly 1 million in interest on a $300k fixer-upper), and usury. We\u2019re already heading into a recession, along with a likely housing and AI crash. Now we\u2019re gonna try creating more inflation when it\u2019s already out of control, increasing housing costs even more, and handout mortgages that are way worse than any of the subprime loans in 08. Bank of America lost a class action for telling millions of homeowners they needed to MISS PAYMENTS to qualify for refinancing, subsequently foreclosing on their homes anyway in 08. They blatantly stole peoples\u2019 homes from them via fraud, were bailed out by taxpayers, profited, and then only paid around $1,400 to victims. They\u2019re gonna have an even better time taking advantage of this setup. permalink parent award report block reply Covfefebrulee 2 points 3 days ago Grim. permalink parent award report block reply Whereisbiden 2 points 3 days ago not if you have a life insurance that pays it off after you pass away permalink parent award report block reply Seruna_Kanus 10 points 3 days ago It's sickening that interest values can accumulate to more than half the value of the home to begin with. permalink award report block reply Im_RickSteves_bitch 12 points 3 days ago That should fall under the legal definition of usury. permalink parent award report block reply Seruna_Kanus 2 points 3 days ago Same for auto payments.

If you do the minimum in anything, the cost on you will be higher over time. permalink parent award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 3 points 3 days ago The issue here is Jerome Foul not lowering interest rates at the Fed, which he can without any negative effect. permalink award report block reply imnotdeadyet 3 points 3 days ago Bingo.  Get the interest rates down and get the illegals out and most of the problem is solved. permalink parent award report block reply Gnometard 3 points 3 days ago We also need folks to understand that with debt, the \"payment\" is the MINIMUM PAYMENT. If that's all you're paying on any debt, you're fucking yourself. Can't afford more than the minimum? YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE DEBT!!!!! I'm ok with an option of 50 years, but I'm sick of trying to fix culture with government.

We\u2019re already on track to deport roughly 12,000,000 in four years Moreover -a 50 year mortgage is no different than a 72 month car loan or an 84 month car loan\u2026. It\u2019s just a tool you can use to finance something that you can\u2019t actually afford, but may be able to based on your economic situation in the future. ie -someone just starting out in a career with rapid advancement could afford to pay off the house well ahead of the 50 year mark Meanwhile, the lower payment affords you the ability to use money elsewhere in the short term It\u2019s just a tool.
