She doesn't say she never saw him there. She said she never spent time with the two of them together. Epstein is saying in this email that she and President spent hours together at his house, but makes no claims to being there. permalink parent award report block reply StoneRealist 6 points 3 hours ago So based on what you're saying Epstein claims Trump and Guiffre spent hours together at his house, but Guiffre has testified she never saw him there? permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 1 points 3 hours ago She doesn\u2019t say he was never at his house. In fact, in her 2016 deposition she specifically says he was. In the quote part provided here she says she never spent time with Epstein and Trump together.

Epstein's lawyers said that Epstein himself didn't have anything on Trump after specifically requesting it. And recently it came out that James Comey's daughter (the same one who gently prosecuted P Diddy) offered Epstein freedom in exchange for dirt on Trump. permalink parent award report block reply Wrexxis780 5 points 4 hours ago You are probably right.

Trump is the dog that didn\u2019t bark. Maybe means he didn\u2019t squeal or rat according to Epstein. But he could have been working with authorities unknown to Epstein. Just speculation since context wasn\u2019t offered. permalink parent award report block reply fullpotato1776 16 points 4 hours ago Why did Trump upgrade Gislane's prison cell?

(With perhaps a back door deal to free her early) So she and her lawyer obviously used this to her advantage. Trumps team gave her a nicer jail cell after she went on record with what we already knew, trump did nothing wrong. If this was first term trump, he would\u2019ve sat back, & said \u201cI did nothing wrong and have nothing to hide\u201d and did nothing while the democrats would\u2019ve ate his lunch and convinced a desperate lady to lie about trump.

It actually look good for Trump, with essentially everyone saying Trump didn\u2019t do shit. So I don\u2019t know why the libtards are pushing it. permalink award report block reply ChrisSuperDude 2 points 2 hours ago Because they know their base is retarded and willing to live in a fantasy world. There was a fake tweet from Trump with something like \u201cif the stock market goes below a certain number the president should be impeached.\u201d The official liberal stance on it was \u201che didn\u2019t say it but it seems like something he will say so it counts\u201d permalink parent award report block reply popcycle 1 points 2 hours ago it looks better than good.  if this meeting between Giuffre and Trump encouraged her to go to the police, Trump may have been the catalyst for Epsteins downfall. permalink parent award report block reply full_of_shot 1 points 47 minutes ago What, you mean it was so disgusting she realised she couldn't do it anymore? permalink parent award report block reply Bolo 1 points 43 minutes ago Maybe Trump really was an FBI informant against Epstein lol. permalink parent award report block reply Skywise 2 points 3 hours ago Well yeah - the democrats had these files all along but just NOW release them?
