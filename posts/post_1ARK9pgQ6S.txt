A peaceful oligarchy under Putin was not terrible.  Now Russia has gone to shit along with Ukraine.  Same destabilization with the Arab spring.  A lot of dead people caused by people with advanced degrees. They call themselves doctors. permalink parent award report block reply CSIS_CIA_pure-evil 7 points 1 hour ago I read somewhere that most school children are speaking Russian at play, and this angers the Ukrainian government. NATO/EU/CIA/MI6/MIC  engineered this mess, the majority of residents of Ukraine are the victims. Our anger needs to be directed at the deep state / CIA that are the root of most evil - the same actors that are preventing Trump from doing what needs to be done. permalink parent award report block reply YT45 3 points 50 minutes ago It’s an unpopular point, but until a few years before the war kicked off, the consensus among linguists was that Ukrainian is a regional dialect of Russian rather than a distinct language.  There is more mutual intelligibility between them than there is between regular English and several Scottish dialects (particularly Doric Scots), which are still considered English. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpForPresident 2 points 48 minutes ago One of their propaganda outlet responses to the fact that 82% of their schoolchildren speak Russian between classes was to say that they don't punish children and their parents enough for not speaking the only permitted language, Ukrainian.

Anyone paying attention is like, no shit Sherlock. I just don't understand the willingness to treat this like it's somehow breaking news that The war between Russia and Ukraine was manufactured and prolonged by the same suspects responsible for most of the rotten nonsense happening around the world. permalink award report block reply cyberwar 3 points 2 hours ago Trump should have shut it down on day one. now he owns it and it will be his demise. permalink award report block reply Burneraccountno4 4 points 2 hours ago Yup. He ran on shutting it down. And he could have by immediately stopping the flow of US cash, weapons, and Intel. Russia would have won fairly quickly after that, but so what. Instead Trump allowed himself to be suckered into taking sides. Disappointing to say the least. permalink parent award report block reply HunterBidensPC 3 points 2 hours ago Only reason Americans gave money is because it f the kickbacks And any US politician who voted to give them money should be investigated.

On the other hand, I probably would not have given a fuck about Hitler invading Poland, but look where that ended up. permalink award report block reply TrumpForPresident 1 points 39 minutes ago And Russia actually defeated Hitler, so your whole post makes no sense. You can argue that Ukraine stole Crimea and Donbass from Russia in 1991, when Russia was weak, and then you would indeed be right. permalink parent award report block reply blackswans 0 points 2 hours ago Hitler invaded Prussia. permalink parent award report block reply DeltaSierra 1 points 2 hours ago Where is Prussia? permalink parent award report block reply blackswans 3 points 2 hours ago Prussia is the North Eastern part of Germany that was stolen from Germany when the United States got involved in a war that was none of it's business on April 6, 1917 and upset the balance of power in Europe in order for the banks to get payment on their loans to the UK. permalink parent award report block reply DeltaSierra 1 points 2 hours ago Thanks.
