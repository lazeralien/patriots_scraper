Every single Leftist that calls him starts off thinking they \"got him\" with one of their moronic points.  Andrew immediately blows them out of the water with facts and logic and they immediately go right to angrily yelling, name calling, and insults.

The best thing I ever heard on Sirius/XM was on the David Webb show.  He took a call on air from some lefty journalist/blogger type and the laughs started.  She went off on him for several minutes on end berating him for his \"white privilege.\"  He let her go on, no interruptions,  until she finally ran down.

He was a RINO, but when he saw how popular Trump was with people after Trump won the first term he started to copy Trump to a degree. Did it long enough that the RINO part of him slowly starved while that new attitude and observation was fed. Eventually, this became his real attitude before he was even nominated to the position, and working in that position just enforced that new attitude. I still say never trust politicians, but look at their work record.

Impossible to trust government without being an idiot. Everyone in government  should be scrutinized as a crook; those who seem to pass the test should still be suspected for what they might be getting away with that we just don't know about yet.
