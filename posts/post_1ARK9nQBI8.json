President Trump should also release the Epstein list. permalink award report block reply Simple_Doot 32 points 3 hours ago There is nothing worth protecting that makes keeping them sealed worth continuing.  It literally does not matter what happens to who if released and the only way forward is to disclose it all.  Zero alternative ways forward. permalink parent award report block reply AlohaChris 42 points 3 hours ago Epstein and Maxwell sexually trafficked children to\u2026nobody permalink parent award report block reply ParmesanCartel 21 points 3 hours ago Weird how she met with trumps personal lawyer and was then moved to a more luxurious correctional facility permalink parent award report block reply KrakenWakin4JoeBacon 15 points 2 hours ago Horrible look & feel to reading that Maxwell is \u201cmuch happier now\u201d that she\u2019s been moved to a different facility. Some victims claim she was a bigger psychopath & more cruel than Epstein. It\u2019s also messed up that all of the male pedos involved are getting a pass, as if Maxwell\u2019s sentence fully represents justice. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

I guess we'll know if that's the case if he does release them, and then he automatically starts getting problems from certain high-power groups.  Releasing the files might add some speedbumps to Trump's agenda. They probably should get released, but if they are being used as leverage, we may get a slowdown on other items. permalink parent award report block reply the-new-style 5 points 2 hours ago So why isn't it working? permalink parent award report block reply fat50 3 points 2 hours ago Exactly. They're fighting him every step of the way. permalink parent award report block reply LabTech 2 points 2 hours ago To continue the speculation... how would you know if it wasn't? All of this stuff is happening in the background, and I suspect the whole point would be to make it invisible.  We'll only know it was in effect if there's a sudden uptick in interference in the America First agenda after the release; that difference would've been from the people who were under duress. permalink parent award report block reply view 7 more comments... Millie1234 2 points 56 minutes ago Those elites can't be left in place, even to do Trump's bidding. Once he's gone, they'll carry on. permalink parent award report block reply LabTech 1 points 29 minutes ago I'm not saying they should, I'm just assuming Trump has a plan, because he obviously knows more than any of us. One would imagine the leverage is short-term, and once he figured he can do an end around and expose them after that point, he will. permalink parent award report block reply cchris_39 0 points 1 hour ago Exactly.  This requires people to have intelligence based on more than their fee fees so no liberal will ever understand or believe it. permalink parent award report block reply LabTech 2 points 25 minutes ago The problem is that society's been groomed for immediate impulse satisfaction, so few people can grasp delayed gratification. If it takes Trump 6 months to unfurl a scheme to get one item or another on the agenda accomplished, the doomers on this site and elsewhere make like he's somehow caved. These people are also apparently unaware of the fact that Trump MUST drain the Swamp by the time his term is over, because if one of their creatures gets into office after him, him and his entire bloodline as well as friends/associates are FUCKED... because it'll be constant lawfare and violence until the end of their days.  Trump MUST smash this machine, out of purely self-preservation reasons. permalink parent award report block reply DefinitelyNotFed 14 points 3 hours ago This would give him back the support of the people but he would lose most of his big donors. Pretty obvious which he values more. permalink parent award report block reply ParmesanCartel 12 points 3 hours ago Big time. Anything short of flipping the table won't save the support of the people now. But he's gone full retard unfortunately. He toasted the midterms. permalink parent award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 10 points 2 hours ago And what a terrible choice he has made! President Trump already won re-election. He does not require donors for any future election, unless he is hoping for funding for his children's political careers or joint business endeavors. As for Congressional elections, the senators and representatives are hardly aligned with President Trump's agenda (filibuster?), so why should he need to sacrifice his soul for those politicians. permalink parent award report block reply UsernameChexOut 5 points 2 hours ago But that's why I think this goes beyond just the donors. There's gotta be something bigger in play here. I'm not a legal scholar here but I imagine it's not going to be a pretty situation if it turns out that another \"ally\" of ours is blackmailing and controlling our government. I'm not saying that that's 100% the case, but I imagine that if with all the backlash Trump is still protecting the files, there's gotta be some really insidious shit in there. permalink parent award report block reply hansgruber7 0 points 26 minutes ago Joined 6 days ago. permalink parent award report block reply GlorpLorp 1 points 18 minutes ago Brother shut the fuck up about account age. These are valid questions and statements. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 6 points 2 hours ago And his big donors are all anti-MAGA parasites, either from the Tech sector that was virulently anti Trump before 2023 or connected to AIPAC/Israel who have a history of backing Trump challengers. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 0 points 1 hour ago People should look into the 3 big donors spending millions trying to unseat Thomas Massie if they haven't already. They fit this description perfectly. permalink parent award report block reply UsernameChexOut 3 points 2 hours ago He would lose his big donors and big nose donors as well permalink parent award report block reply try4gain PRO 14 points 3 hours ago Epstein Files are the new JFK files permalink parent award report block reply hansgruber7 4 points 2 hours ago Why does anyone think the Democrats left an incriminating Epstein list for Trump to find?  Anyone who believes that is a naive retard. permalink parent award report block reply ravonaf 5 points 2 hours ago There is no list, there never was a list. What they have are people scatter throughout reams of evidence who were targeted by the Intelligent Agencies via Epstein. There are LOTS of innocent people who did nothing wrong. As well as people who did, I'm sure. But there is no way to separate the 2 without dragging innocent people through the mud. Why should anyone have their lives ruined because they were targeted by Deep State Intelligent Agencies? permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 0 points 1 hour ago RFK explicitly said yes he was on Epstein's plane, said what the circumstances were and said release the files. Anyone who can't do that has something to hide. Fuck them. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai -1 points 1 hour ago Epstein has been around the globe mediating intel/security deals between Israel and various shithole countries. The Deep State cares more about exposure than about child safety. That's what I think is the reason for hiding the files. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 2 hours ago Not that I know for sure, but I strongly suspect that Trump not releasing the Epstein list is the only way he can ever get ANYTHING through the senate for the next 3 years. permalink parent award report block reply load 3 more comments... nakedjay 49 points 3 hours ago It's all Dems have, projection and disinformation. permalink award report block reply Pied-Trumper 14 points 3 hours ago Glad that\u2019s settled.

There\u2019s now affordability crisis! Things are amazing! Waarrrrr, we need waaarr! permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 3 points 1 hour ago They wouldn't have this disinfo option if the files were released. permalink parent award report block reply leakmouth 2 points 2 hours ago The best thing about fake news is watching the libtards get their hopes up over and over again and then watching those hopes get destroyed every single time permalink parent award report block reply TrumpTurd69 -2 points 3 hours ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply Than0sIII 38 points 3 hours ago If they truly had anything it would've been 2024's October surprise, if not used sooner to indict Trump on conspiracy/aiding sex trafficking. permalink award report block reply ChrisSuperDude 19 points 3 hours ago My whole thing is that they would\u2019ve used it in 2015-2016 when he was first getting momentum. Or even in 2020 after Epstein died and was in the news cycle. permalink parent award report block reply BidensBodyDouble 4 points 2 hours ago And you can tell in those emails with Wolff that that plan was on the table for them too permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 1 points 3 hours ago Not if their big names are in it too. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 10 points 2 hours ago They have selectively released information before. That's all they had to do, block out anything not related to Trump and quash all attempts at further unsealings This line of argument has always been faulty permalink parent award report block reply Than0sIII 1 points 58 minutes ago Exactly.  I don't get why people are pretending there's some world where they wouldn't selectively pull out damning pieces of evidence against Trump.  People don't really want to think, they just want to have their biases confirmed. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia -3 points 2 hours ago Then why haven't we released the parts pertaining to them? I'm mean, by the same token, if Clinton, Roberts, and half of the democrat congress is in there, why haven't we used it? I mean, if they're just selectively leaving all the incriminating stuff about themselves out? permalink parent award report block reply emorphia 4 points 2 hours ago and i bet they are.  but we will never find out sadly. permalink parent award report block reply Aquamine-Amarine 1 points 2 hours ago All they had was the pussy tape. That's it. permalink parent award report block reply Goodgoodygoodgood 1 points 2 hours ago I have a theory they didn\u2019t release them because they have just as much to lose. I expect them to have more to lose permalink parent award report block reply JDVance4President28 27 points 3 hours ago Trump's response to the Epstein stuff was very suspicious tho permalink award report block reply Simple_Doot 19 points 3 hours ago Definitely.  If he is not playing some crazy \"5D\" chess Q plan then he has failed us completely.  And if he IS playing some 5D chess then he is intentionally saying the stupidest shit possible which justifies our outrage.  So being pissed about it is the correct way to be. permalink parent award report block reply Area82 9 points 3 hours ago Heard on a couple of podcasts lately that Epstein's main gig was money laundering and arms deals for various gubmints since the 80s.   I wonder if that is true? permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 1 points 1 hour ago Epstein was mediating surveillance state deals between Israel and Cote de'Ivore. I'd be more surprised if he wasn't a money laundering govt asset. permalink parent award report block reply PhoneBandit 1 points 1 hour ago It definitely seems like the case as his account is still seeing transactions apparently. I read that Trump was also a money launderer for the feds and that's why he was aware of Epstein's sex business. They have leverage on him just like Epstein which is why he's playing ball. permalink parent award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 7 points 2 hours ago The whole operation looks very Mossad, so hopefully it's just that he can't bear to call out Israel for once. Either way, he couldn't have handled the situation worse if he tried. permalink parent award report block reply sorrytodisagree 5 points 3 hours ago He wouldn't spend years campaigning for their release to his own detriment.  The only thing that makes any sense is they've been deliberately spoiled while SDNY had them.  Seeded with manufactured falsehoods as a poison chalice.  Proving the tampering won't convince doubters and makes all the rest suspect and inadmissible.  Withholding the fakes is easily exposed by the perpetrators as a \"coverup worse than the crime\" Watergate scenario.  For them better than deleting it all.  simply destroying the evidence incriminates themselves and they can't be sure copies won't surface.  This way releasing it is a lose/lose, eliminates it's criminal evidence and political value, but maintains it's blackmail value for intelligence agencies. permalink parent award report block reply JDVance4President28 11 points 3 hours ago Well then arrest those responsible for the corruption. Surly the full weight of the DOJ could sort it out. The most sophisticated spying apparatus in human history isn't useless here unless it's intentional. permalink parent award report block reply sorrytodisagree 3 points 2 hours ago Nobody said it wasn't an intentional act by deep stater's in that DOJ and spying apparatus.  Even if they screwed up and you can prove their tampering the fakes come out and are believed by democrats and idiots anyway. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 6 points 2 hours ago He wouldn't spend years campaigning for their release to his own detriment. He never campaigned on their release. We just projected what we wanted to hear on to someone who was never saying it. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 3 points 2 hours ago He did say he would release it when baited by a reporter in an interview, but yes it wasn't some big action item in the campaign that I can recall permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 2 points 2 hours ago Once, after this election, and then waffled on that answer even after saying, yes I guess so. permalink parent award report block reply AuAgCuPb 0 points 2 hours ago All I ever remember him saying when asked about \"releasing the Epstein files\" if he became president was, \"We'll look into it.\"\nWell, they DID look into it, and guess what?  they decided to not release them.  So he DID fulfill his campaign promise of \"looking into it\".  \ud83d\ude06 permalink parent award report block reply ImClearlyLost 2 points 2 hours ago Trump never spent years campaigning for their release.  He only reluctantly answered once he was directly asked, he never brought it up on his own volition ever. permalink parent award report block reply sorrytodisagree 1 points 2 hours ago And he did his best to put Epstein behind bars years before he ran for President.  Not something you do if somebody had files on you to present at trial... https://x.com/rawsalerts/status/1964068279292399961 https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/02/brad-edwards-jeffrey-epstein-victim-attorney-donald-trump-mar-a-lago/ permalink parent award report block reply Corse46 3 points 3 hours ago So true, unfortunately permalink parent award report block reply load 3 more comments...

But that doesn\u2019t answer why the President is running an Epstein pedophilia coverup permalink parent award report block reply Oldman1945 11 points 2 hours ago He should have released all files the morning after Epstein was found dead. All of this should have been released in Trump\u2019s first term, at that exact moment. Saving it to win the election is fine, but not if that promise is broken. Release all files!! permalink parent award report block reply JanOctSept 1 points 2 hours ago In all fairness the Hillary emails about Russiagate in the Turducken safe existed under Trump too, meaning I don\u2019t think the FBI was particularly loyal to him. permalink parent award report block reply MakeCaliforniaRED 1 points 1 hour ago It still isn\u2019t. permalink parent award report block reply referencevariable 2 points 2 hours ago Because a deal was made in return for assistance getting his agenda accomplished. See here: https://patriots.win/p/19BZphlAOd/unfortunately-a-deal-was-made/c permalink parent award report block reply LostElf 1 points 3 hours ago The files are likely infested with false information targeting innocent people. That's what happens when an investigation is so thoroughly corrupted. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 2 points 59 minutes ago the surest way to expose false information is to allow the internet to fact check it we got podesta's emails and we should get the epstein files too permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 1 points 27 minutes ago So if you were guilty wouldn't you declare its all false. Use your head people. The left doesnt use it because whats left would also take down their house of cards. Its  MAD files. permalink parent award report block reply TennesseeBorn 0 points 1 hour ago They 100 percent poisoned them. Why wouldn't they? permalink parent award report block reply KekistaniMemeLord 0 points 2 hours ago extremely dishonest framing. Literally no one here knows what is going on with the Epstein case and investigation atm. Immediately assuming Trump is running cover for pedo's or trying to protect them is some MSM scumbag level shit. permalink parent award report block reply emorphia 2 points 2 hours ago it does not matter if any of it is real , the left will gobble up anything the dems say about Trump.  they say it so it is true for them. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 1 points 2 hours ago Not if their big names are in it too. Mutually assured destruction is a very real and viable tactic for blackmail and control. permalink parent award report block reply sorrytodisagree 2 points 2 hours ago And when people are brainwashed into thinking the worst about Trump and ignoring his history all they need to do is fake the other sides big names in the files if need be.  Fake dossiers have proven enough to impeach as far as democrats are concerned. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia -2 points 2 hours ago Son, stop sending me the damn huffington post and acting like it's proof the democrats are squeaky clean. I'm not a child that just swallows anything that tells me what I want to hear. I can think critically. If they were faking their names, then why haven't WE released it since we're so confident they're there? permalink parent award report block reply sorrytodisagree 1 points 2 hours ago You're literally the only one invoking huffington post and also pretending I'm defending democrats?

I know Trump did not suddenly do a 180 because he woke up one day remembering he was in on it. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 2 points 2 hours ago fake is real and real is fake Always has been. You don't get to suggest that continuing this charade by hiding information suddenly changes things for the worse permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 0 points 2 hours ago He didn't do a 180. He's never really said anything at all about epstein short of trying to distance himself from him, ever. Even when he was murdered in prison under our watch. He's asking us to do a 180 because the issue has finally caught up to the times. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... Simple_Doot 2 points 3 hours ago This argument is absolutely unacceptable.  Release and let the chips fall where they may.

The emails are complaining that Trump, basically, isn't falling into their trap. permalink award report block reply PhoneBandit 1 points 1 hour ago Yes. The only conclusion you can draw from this is that Trump knew of the sex business but was not making a huge stink over it. That doesn't implicate him to me. I'm sure there are hundreds of government officials aware of heinous crimes that they turn a blind eye to. permalink parent award report block reply ThorsonTT 2 points 1 hour ago I'd bet that so much evidence has been destroyed or polluted that not enough remains to give to a grand jury with any hope of a conviction. permalink parent award report block reply Kricket 12 points 3 hours ago If they had anything real, they would have burned him well before now. permalink award report block reply liberalshitlord -2 points 3 hours ago Him and Clinton kek, kek, kek permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 9 points 3 hours ago But remember, QUESTION if a thing is real or fake.

Big headline, photo with Epstein Actual email content: Trump asks Epstein to stay away for Mar a lago (only member ever asked to resign) and asks Maxwell to stop offering him girls permalink award report block reply KernalMustard 1 points 9 minutes ago They were running a honeypot operation for blackmail. Dude had money coming out his ears. The only thing left is being the man behind the curtian. He didnt do this alone. He passed it along and used it for blackmail. There isnt any doubt thats what he did. This is why it hasnt been released. Its a giant fucking bomb permalink parent award report block reply ceva 2 points 3 hours ago RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES permalink award report block reply IvIA6A 2 points 2 hours ago Once again, if there was anything there, you think Obama or Biden wouldn't have released it during the campaign? permalink award report block reply TrumpRideorDie74 1 points 2 hours ago When Trump ran for re-election in 2020 I didn't understand why he never commercialized the mountain of clips showing Biden acting strange with little girls. He was sniffing their hair and touching them in ways only a parent should which caused these kids to react in a way where they wanted to be anywhere else. Every fuckin thing they try to get Trump on was all fabricated bullshit while all have access to the Biden tapes which seem to have been swept under the rug. This pede remembers. permalink parent award report block reply sod_off_shotgun 1 points 2 hours ago It's the same with the first impeachment. Imagine Bidet openly discussing, some might say bragging, about a quid pro quo in Ukraine. Now imagine he did that in a very public way that is available to view by anyone.  What's that you say? It actually happened? Quick let's impeach Trump for it. permalink parent award report block reply Snivelingsnitches1 2 points 3 hours ago Just release all the files and we can decide for ourselves! permalink award report block reply Mhmm2MoreWeeks 2 points 2 hours ago Not only is it not going away, but its continuing to be used to undermine Trump.

They are all demons, yep I guess they are all demons. Yes, the Bible states that the devil is a liar. A key verse is\nJohn 8:44, where Jesus refers to the devil as \"a murderer from the beginning\" and a liar who does not stand in the truth because \"there is no truth in him.\" This verse says that when he lies, he speaks out of his own character because he is a liar and the father of lies, according to Open Bible Info and Open the Bible. Yes, the Bible states that demons know how to lie, with the most prominent example being Satan being called \"the father of lies\" in John 8:44. Demons are portrayed as being masters of deception, using lies as a primary tactic to mislead people. permalink award report block reply ThouShallNotSteal 2 points 2 hours ago Well we all know 1 thing for sure...Bill Clinton is a rapist. permalink award report block reply sod_off_shotgun 2 points 2 hours ago Normies need to exercise some common sense. If there was anything incriminating regarding Trump and victims, it would have been leaked years ago. Sure, his name is mentioned at various points, but never anything related to him acting improperly. I know there will be zero evidence of that, because the dems would have already used it. permalink award report block reply South_Florida_Guy 2 points 3 hours ago If any of it were ever true they would have used it a LONG time ago before he got elected not once but twice.

If there was anything there, they would have got him already. Now sue all the publications that ran with that garbage. permalink award report block reply TrumpRideorDie74 2 points 2 hours ago That's the real answer. The dems have thrown everything and the kitchen sink against him and still can't find anything to persecute him on so they create lies, hoaxes and misdirection. They're at the point where they're throwing everything against the wall and hoping anything sticks. Newsflash: nothing will stick because if they had anything worth a damn he'd be in jail by now. permalink parent award report block reply sod_off_shotgun 2 points 2 hours ago That's what I said in another comment. The fact that there has been no leak linking Trump to sex trafficking confirms there aren't any, as the dems would have used it already permalink parent award report block reply MAGAnificent700 1 points 1 hour ago Sue and add ANOTHER wing to the White House using the money.

Trump made millions of dollars by snatching the opportunity away from him. The real estate deal was actually kind of unethical.

As for Congressional elections, the senators and representatives are hardly aligned with President Trump's agenda (filibuster?), so why should he need to sacrifice his soul for those politicians. permalink parent award report block reply UsernameChexOut 5 points 2 hours ago But that's why I think this goes beyond just the donors. There's gotta be something bigger in play here. I'm not a legal scholar here but I imagine it's not going to be a pretty situation if it turns out that another \"ally\" of ours is blackmailing and controlling our government. I'm not saying that that's 100% the case, but I imagine that if with all the backlash Trump is still protecting the files, there's gotta be some really insidious shit in there. permalink parent award report block reply hansgruber7 0 points 26 minutes ago Joined 6 days ago. permalink parent award report block reply GlorpLorp 1 points 18 minutes ago Brother shut the fuck up about account age.

He has literally proven himself by fighting for MAGA for 10 damn years and almost getting killed for the effort. I don't see thoughtful critique of our president, I see the absolute dumbest fucks abandoning all critical thought to attack him no different than a lefty would.

They are all demons, yep I guess they are all demons. Yes, the Bible states that the devil is a liar. A key verse is\nJohn 8:44, where Jesus refers to the devil as \"a murderer from the beginning\" and a liar who does not stand in the truth because \"there is no truth in him.\" This verse says that when he lies, he speaks out of his own character because he is a liar and the father of lies, according to Open Bible Info and Open the Bible. Yes, the Bible states that demons know how to lie, with the most prominent example being Satan being called \"the father of lies\" in John 8:44. Demons are portrayed as being masters of deception, using lies as a primary tactic to mislead people. permalink award report block reply\nThouShallNotSteal 2 points 2 hours ago Well we all know 1 thing for sure...Bill Clinton is a rapist. permalink award report block reply\nsod_off_shotgun 2 points 2 hours ago Normies need to exercise some common sense.
