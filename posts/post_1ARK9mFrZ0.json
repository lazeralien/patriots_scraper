Problem is... That doesn't mean anything. There is no legal mechanism or weight behind labelling something a domestic terrorist organization. What DOES carry weight is labelling them as a foreign terrorist organization. That opens up fun and exciting options like the PATRIOT Act. permalink award report block reply FlyCatcher94 2 points 11 hours ago No one is going after them permalink award report block reply lifeisahologram 2 points 11 hours ago Love how he shot his dominant arm permalink award report block reply learntocode 2 points 16 hours ago GLOBOSHLOMO NEEDS A US CIVIL WAR permalink award report block reply learntocode 2 points 16 hours ago I am gonna start an H1B company to hire Indians to street fight Antifa. permalink award report block reply learntocode 1 points 16 hours ago Jokes is on you Globalists.
