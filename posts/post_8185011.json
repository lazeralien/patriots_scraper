  "content": "129 I am so sick of Walmart! posted 6 hours ago by boredrandomguy 39 comments award share report block My car is currently out of commission and I live on the edge of town far away from any grocery stores. As such, I'm at the mercy of getting a ride from someone or having food delivered. Last night I made the mistake of placing an order from Walmart to be delivered this morning.  I waited up until the near end of the delivery window. I received notice that the order was on the way. I watched the tracker show the GPS location of the driver (named Jose Louis) and the guy overshot my street and was driving up and down another street. After about 5-10 minutes of this, I received notice that my order was delivered and it showed a picture of a house that was not mine and one that I did not recognize.  I walked outside and checked a few neighbors' porches to no avail. I reached out to Walmart and had to go through the motions with an AI chatbot just to get them to call me.  I received a call about 15 minutes later (AI again) before finally connecting to a human being.  Of course that  person was in India with a thick accent. She argued at first, saying my order was delivered and to the correct address. After a few minutes of that, I finally got her to refund my order. I still had to go in to the order to manually remove the tip because that was considered a separate charge that went directly to their (probably illegal) delivery driver. So now I'm stuck without groceries. Fuck Walmart!\n39 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save 2flathat 15 points 6 hours ago Typical Walmart service.

Except in rare instances, local politicians forged ahead anyway and pushed a lot of towns barely surviving after the factory left over the edge. Then came the Obamacare flood of opiates... I'm sure this happened numerous times, but does anyone remember the famous story of a Walmart whos land lease (and subsidies) where comeing up and the local politicians wouldn't give them the tax waivers they wanted? Walmart up and closes their store and builds a new walmart like 100 yards away, on the other side of the town border, leaving the monstrosity of an empty building to decay? Walmart is evil. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver 2 points 4 hours ago I absolutely do remember the fight to keep Walmarts out of small towns. Small dept stores on Main Street started closing or converting to tattoo shops and bars.  I remember Carmen\u2019s that sold ONLY winter coats, nothing else!! And Fanny Farmers that sold ONLY candy, nothing else! Bookstores, florists, toys, even a store that sold ONLY posters for the wall. Wandering shops was fun because you could find this huge selection everywhere, exploring territory to find your valuable treasure. It\u2019s how we passed a lot of happy hours. Until \u2018get everything in one trip\u2019 was seen as a big improvement, which it was at the time. Everyone suddenly wanted to be somewhere else!  People adapted. We always do.

And they're all legal. The illegal ones literally started disappearing after Trump was elected.  you can usually tell when they're driving a beater car, and they've got a temp tag in the window. One that looks like it's been hanging for the last 2 years. WalMart delivery was having problems with illegal immigrants using vetted peoples accounts to deliver.  Lately they've implemented regular identification verifications. And you can also see the driver's picture in the app when you're getting your delivery. Anyone who sees that it isn't the same person, that should be delivering your order, needs to report it immediately. Ever since the purge, we're getting better drivers here and less problems. But if you're in a blue City that would be a possible sanctuary, you're going to have issues. permalink parent award report block reply Dreddhead13 1 points 6 hours ago Also another thing. GPS gets s*** f***** up all the time. Yesterday I had GPS take me to the neighbor's house. But luckily I check every time I stop. A way to avoid a problem, however you gave them the address, put it in yourself to Google maps. See what happens. Make sure it's pointing to your home. You can do that also by turning on your overhead view to satellite. Uses a little more data, but will get you better results. Because Walmart has that address in there and you might have put the address in correct, if Google has it wrong, Walmart has it wrong. Because you can't even close or deliver the item unless you are in the right spot according to the app. But because a lot of these immigrants are low IQ, they don't know to double check and that Google is fallible. When this happens to me, I usually have to clock in the order at the wrong spot. Then drive the order to the correct spot to deliver. It's a pain in the ass. But you got to do what you got to do to get the job done correctly. Then I have to report it.  Hopefully to get the pajeets in customer service to change to the proper location. permalink parent award report block reply Dreddhead13 1 points 6 hours ago It's not always directly Walmart's fault.
