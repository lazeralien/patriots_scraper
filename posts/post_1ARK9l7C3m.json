Every single evil entity has been trying to inject itself and subvert the movement. They can\u2019t have a populist movement succeed otherwise their world takeover loses. Whether or not they got to Trump or he was a setup the entire time doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s clearly abandoned his base for foreigners at this point. Burn it all down kick out the foreigners and traitors. There\u2019s no political solution at this point. permalink parent award report block reply Girthquakes -9 points 1 day ago You faggots are always welcome to jump ship and go make your own party. None of this faux concern is going to convince us to abandon GEOTUS. Your \"death by a thousand cuts\" will fail, just like every other attempt to subvert this forum and the MAGA movement as a whole. Lefty faggots can get fucked. permalink parent award report block reply UntakenUsername 9 points 1 day ago Nobody is trying to convince you to abandon anything. If you can't see, you can't see. \"There are those who see, those who can see when shown, and those who will never see.\" I do admire your unending loyalty for Trump and his administration, however.  I predict that, at some point, even people like yourself will have to look at reality for what it is.  I love President Trump and his family and have voted for him every time and would do it again. But, his administration, while doing more that any US President we have ever seen, has failed to do the one thing that would fix everything. They didn't drain The Swamp. Is it because of Bondi or Patel? Maybe so, but the buck stops at the Oval Office. He has shown public frustration with Bondi, but hasn't fired/replace her with someone who will be as ruthless as is required. It's on him, ultimately. He would say exactly the same thing about a leader in his same position. permalink parent award report block reply staroframphansbhole 6 points 1 day ago It\u2019s because the poster you\u2019re replying to drinks milkshakes laden with shabbat splooge if you know what I\u2019m saying permalink parent award report block reply NazisWereSocialist 3 points 1 day ago Ok grandpa permalink parent award report block reply Alpha_Lemming 6 points 1 day ago The only \"solutions\" that are acceptable in a debt based system are the ones that involve more debt. With this, debts are created and sold through various financial instruments where the consumer \"saves\" $300 per month, but pays an additional couple hundred grand over the term. Meanwhile, the lender takes their cut and then peddles the note through the pupeline to let it explode on somebody else's ledger. Half of the houses built in the last 20 years won't last 50 years. permalink award report block reply mohel OP 4 points 1 day ago Let's print more money permalink parent award report block reply LauraCoomer 5 points 1 day ago It's been so painful. permalink award report block reply LiquidSun 9 points 1 day ago I've largely just stopped caring. I'll do what I can in my own life, but I don't know that I'll bother voting again.

It will increase demand without a change to supply. That means prices go up. That\u2019s retarded. permalink award report block reply AmericanMestizo 2 points 19 hours ago The economy is so fucking broken and fake that any attempt to fix it will likely crash the economy worse than 2008. No politician wants to be blamed for that. That's the crux of the matter the moves to fix anything is painful. Most voters are ignorant and short sighted. The moment there is any pain they will simply blame those in charge and blibdly vote in the other guy. The strategy of the elites is to do everything in there power to keep the current system humming along. The corporate elite like it because it makes them richer at the expense of the common man and the politicians like it because they want to avoid another crash. The problem is none of this is sustainable in the long run. I'm kind of amazed they've kept things going as long as they have. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 1 points 1 day ago This site is overrun with retards permalink award report block reply HeavenlyTrumpets -2 points 1 day ago I mean, it is a wrecking ball to the status quo lol...
