I think the only people worth mentioning actually doing a major good job in the MAGA space is Judicial Watch, OMG Media, Tulsi Gabbard, and RFK Jr. Bondi has been cashing out along with her second in command who doesn't even want to prosecute Comey and Brannon and then we have Cash Patel wanting to be a local super cop flying around with his girlfriend going to party's, and Narco Rubio wants us to invade South America and sabotage Russian peace efforts. The admin has become a shit show and Trump needs to use his brain and listen to the voters again like he was until May and then the Epstein shit happened which started all of this. permalink parent award report block reply\nBeauHD 2 points 5 days ago hold the first rare-earth magnet produced in the United States in 25 years.

It costs and took some know how but we  figured it out. And when oil is 50 bucks a barrel or more it is cheaper for the us to get oil from rocks.  Soooo, we can do the same thing with rare earth elements.  give us some time and it won't matter how hard it was or is for the rest of the world. permalink award report block reply\nCaliAli 2 points 5 days ago Good, Fuck China and Fuck Eric Swalwell. permalink award report block reply\nmykillk 1 points 5 days ago Jeez this really hits home how fucked we would be if the globalized manufacturing chain broke down.
