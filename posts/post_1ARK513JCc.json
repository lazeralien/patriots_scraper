There are far too many people who still believe the multicultist fairy tale about a Religion of Peace(tm). They need to see what this is. The collective west right now is being systematically dismantled by people exploiting rich, pampered white women who buy into the rainbows and unicorns Santa Claus promises. These women vote for this crap and think it's a moral good, but never learn any better because they don't have to deal with the consequences. They are protected by a masculine shield and their own privilege, so they never appreciate the danger. Remigration now, or Reconquista. That's what it's going to take. Pick one of those, or submit to being their slave. Either way, the damage is done. They're already here. Our once-free country is gone.

I've made it 38yrs without any and I just dont see why the need for it. permalink award report block reply Dev404 0 points 6 days ago Religion is used to bring people together, for good and bad. Religion is used to pass down values. It has it's place. What the actual problem is comes down to human nature. We all have our biases and willingness to do evil shit for our own gain, regardless of whatever religion. For people looking to do evil shit in the name of some religion, religion is just a tool, they don't even necessarily believe in it, but can manipulate who do. Ideally, religion can provide guidance for people to not live just for themselves and \"fuck everyone who's not me or my family.\" Religion is at least as valuable as books, good for passing down lessons, values, and information, but can be used for nefarious purposes by bad people. permalink parent award report block reply TheDarkEmperor 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\nTrooph-Hurts 37 points 6 days ago These people have nothing to offer other than this kind of bullshit\u2026.

These women vote for this crap and think it's a moral good, but never learn any better because they don't have to deal with the consequences. They are protected by a masculine shield and their own privilege, so they never appreciate the danger. Remigration now, or Reconquista. That's what it's going to take. Pick one of those, or submit to being their slave. Either way, the damage is done. They're already here. Our once-free country is gone. It's decision time. permalink award report block reply\nthisaintitchief76 1 points 6 days ago I will defend my home when evil knocks. I will not shed tears or even give a thought to those who voted themselves into the muslim hoard. I will not defend them, nor attack them. Just watch, as their worlds are torn to pieces. permalink award report block reply\nglow-operator-2-0 1 points 6 days ago Muhammed Sex Simulator 2015. permalink award report block reply\nSeatacjoe 1 points 6 days ago Fuck ISLAM permalink award report block reply\nCSIS_CIA_pure-evil 1 points 6 days ago Most excellent. I hope they quickly overplay their hand so that the majority awakens to the danger this evil cult poses to our civilization. permalink award report block reply\n1True-translation 1 points 6 days ago All those woke atheists who supported this invasion are going to be so disappointed lol.

I've made it 38yrs without any and I just dont see why the need for it. permalink award report block reply Dev404 0 points 6 days ago Religion is used to bring people together, for good and bad. Religion is used to pass down values. It has it's place. What the actual problem is comes down to human nature. We all have our biases and willingness to do evil shit for our own gain, regardless of whatever religion. For people looking to do evil shit in the name of some religion, religion is just a tool, they don't even necessarily believe in it, but can manipulate who do. Ideally, religion can provide guidance for people to not live just for themselves and \"fuck everyone who's not me or my family.\" Religion is at least as valuable as books, good for passing down lessons, values, and information, but can be used for nefarious purposes by bad people. permalink parent award report block reply\nDev404 0 points 6 days ago Religion is used to bring people together, for good and bad.
