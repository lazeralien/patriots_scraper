MemphisMontoya71 29 points 1 day ago More Mike Flynn yelling at the clouds for things that will never happen.  Thats all our side does now, stompy foot tweeting and hopium chasing, and calling others doomers for seeing reality, that 1 year of this administration has not delivered on its campaign promises to MAGA, but spent its time delivering for other countries.

He works for the government in zero capacity.... permalink parent award report block reply MAGA-Fett -6 points 22 hours ago I still believe Flynn is a grifter.  He was on Obama guy and totally walked into the Russia hoax. He also had alternate electors in summer of 2024 just \u201cin case\u201d something happened to Trump. Don\u2019t trust him at all. permalink parent award report block reply JBlaze056 -7 points 1 day ago It is especially irritating coming from Flynn who was offered any position he wanted in the administration, and who instead declined the offer so he could grift online. permalink parent award report block reply DickTick PRO 6 points 1 day ago I imagine it's probably got more to do with the fact that he doesn't want to risk putting his family through all of the same shit all over again only for their to be no potential pardon at the end of it next time because Trump will be gone by then..... permalink parent award report block reply Elencher 7 points 1 day ago Or because Flynn realizes this administration won't do shit and is compromised. permalink parent award report block reply USDMaga 1 points 19 hours ago Grift onlilne and get rich OR Work for govt, watch nothing be done and be jailed/prosecuted for doing nothing. permalink parent award report block reply MemphisMontoya71 0 points 1 day ago good point permalink parent award report block reply mikethemarine 15 points 24 hours ago Former DNI Tulsi Gabbard just said it out loud: WHY DOES I SAY FORMER?

I suspect the fillabuster was the biggest thing motivating the Dems to conceed permalink parent award report block reply monkadelic 1 points 19 hours ago it was the ONLY thing.  They had no other real pressure to open the government besides Trump securing elections.  Can't have that, it would be the death of their party.

You know, people like you and me.

So before you start shouting treason understand you really mean sedition. Where is the War in the literal sense not in some poetic sense, in the meaning the framers intended?  There isn't. Who is the enemies and in a constitutional law sense this means foreign nations. Not people who aren't real Americans or people that like blue hair. Be exact with your words permalink award report block reply starjello 2 points 17 hours ago I don't blame General Flynn for speaking out. Trump absolutely threw him under the bus taking the side of that snake Pence. I'll never forgive the Q retards for saying General Flynn was part of the Q team when it was Pence as the point man for the operation for the CIA permalink award report block reply TexasDusty 1 points 16 hours ago That\u2019s an interesting theory. Can you share more about it? That would explain a few things. permalink parent award report block reply starjello 1 points 16 hours ago Go back and look at the Space Force press conference Pence had with Chris Miller the Acting Secretary of Defense in December of 2020. Also certain things I am not prepared to bring up at this time.

They try to kill you multiple times, have you arrested charged with made up crimes, steal your whole first presidency! What could possibly stop someone in the relentless pursuit of justice for that? (It's the Epstein files) permalink award report block reply CatalystForChange OP 1 points 3 hours ago Republicans believe that the files have been tampered and most of the evidence were erased during Biden administration permalink parent award report block reply patrioticwinning3 2 points 19 hours ago Apparently not...Bondi is doing a \"great job\" remember?  Who is slipping Trump retard juice!? permalink award report block reply TexasDusty 1 points 16 hours ago Nothing will be done. Nothing. permalink award report block reply 1LoathsomeDove 1 points 9 hours ago Ya know ...\nIn my frontier subdivision, it took 5 LOA (landowners association) Directors over a year to bring a rogue secretary/treasurer to heel.\nThe Articles of Incorporation dictated that the LOA was a \"road maintenance\" association.  Nothing more. For over a decade, voting for Officers was in violation of the Community Documents and state statute. It took a year before we retrieved our LOA's records from being (illegally) stored in another state.  The day after they were returned, the Sheriff arrived to ask us about our 'theft' of those records. I called the rogue director 'a flea' and said the board was tired of scratching the itch and going forward I would squish any fleas instead of entertaining their circus.  Sheriff arrived to discuss my 'death threat'. It took a year for us to stop payments for maintenance and repairs for a 'community well' when our truth in lending disclosure clearly stated, 'Community Well: N/A\" & 'Owners must dig their own well' and to return to an unedited 'plat map'.\n(edited in violation of statute). Bondi et.al. face a rogue BoD ... infinity. Slow and steady.  Do you want it fast or do you want it right? Interestingly, the Director that originally objected to payment for a community well (starting the year-long battle) ... went rogue himself. Be careful what you wish for ..... permalink award report block reply MAGA-Fett 1 points 22 hours ago Meh, SCOTUS pretty much ruled ex-Prez can\u2019t be held accountable for actions they take in office.  Nothing will be done. permalink award report block reply SNOWBREAKS 1 points 19 hours ago wake me up when anything happens ever permalink award report block reply TheJakeFroggy 1 points 1 day ago Does Flynn not have Trump's ear and the ability to directly contact him himself in any way? Does he not at least have associates who have Trump's ear? It makes me curious that he feels the need to constantly tag Trump on X. In fact, it makes me concerned, is it even possible to contact the Trump administration? Tagging Trump and others in his administration on X doesn't apppear to get their attention. How are we as his base supposed to inform him about the things that need to be done? permalink award report block reply TrumpSaysNoMAGA4u 1 points 23 hours ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply barwhack 1 points 24 hours ago Gay retarded faggotry is a thing. permalink award report block reply Bldg_2019 1 points 19 hours ago \u201cFormer DNI\u201d Tulsi Gabbard? \ud83e\udd14 permalink award report block reply michealr24 1 points 23 hours ago Then fucking do something permalink award report block reply CatalystForChange OP 1 points 19 hours ago I think the expectation is for DOJ to do something.

The coup is the MI6 and CIA fabricated Russia COLLUSION. permalink parent award report block reply\nDaffy 0 points 20 hours ago Yeah, but two more weeks. permalink parent award report block reply\nMemphisMontoya71 29 points 1 day ago More Mike Flynn yelling at the clouds for things that will never happen.

Nothing more. For over a decade, voting for Officers was in violation of the Community Documents and state statute. It took a year before we retrieved our LOA's records from being (illegally) stored in another state.  The day after they were returned, the Sheriff arrived to ask us about our 'theft' of those records. I called the rogue director 'a flea' and said the board was tired of scratching the itch and going forward I would squish any fleas instead of entertaining their circus.  Sheriff arrived to discuss my 'death threat'. It took a year for us to stop payments for maintenance and repairs for a 'community well' when our truth in lending disclosure clearly stated, 'Community Well: N/A\" & 'Owners must dig their own well' and to return to an unedited 'plat map'.\n(edited in violation of statute). Bondi et.al. face a rogue BoD ... infinity. Slow and steady.  Do you want it fast or do you want it right?
