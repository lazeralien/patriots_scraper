Stupid to turn his back on him. Then the black guy was an idiot for punching him. White cop is lucky he's a quick draw and black guy did one handed gangsta aim (very little gun control). Honestly both these dudes suck. permalink parent award report block reply Backslash2099 15 points 3 days ago Is that a cop?

Wait your fucking turn.\nAs far as turning your back. You are absolutely correct. I've been driving over 50 years. People are actually becoming more and more aggressive. Thinking they have a right to any situation. Fuck em. They don't. permalink parent award report block reply Bigstick7 -1 points 2 days ago All the dude had to do was let the guy in, let off the gas and let him merge his car was already 3/4 of his car length in front of him. Instead he sped up to keep the guy from merging when approaching a construction zone. The black guy would have had to brake hard then merge them speed up which would have probably impacted the traffic behind the cop. Cop was a douche bag just let the guy over. lol \"nobody owns the road\" the cop sure acted like it by doing everything in his power even to the point of hitting the guy to keep him from merging. This post has informed my there are a bunch of fags on this site that drive like assholes. permalink parent award report block reply 95Rockytoby95 1 points 2 days ago That doesn't give you the right to wait till the very last moment like some assholes do to merge. Im positive there were signs prior to that. So if you do wait till the very last minute.. fuck you and wait. permalink parent award report block reply katsumi27 9 points 3 days ago Car emerging could\u2019ve slowed down and planned to head to get behind.  Plus, the guy didn\u2019t use his turn signal. permalink parent award report block reply IPMang 7 points 3 days ago I don't think that was a punch, looked like he pistol whipped him in the face... Fair to say you're safe to start blasting at that point permalink parent award report block reply Bigstick7 7 points 3 days ago 100% got what he was asking for, no sympathy for the black guy.

Once he enters the lane he has the right of way.  He does not have to occupy the entire lane.  The cop moved way left so he could pull along side and bump the rear right side of the car in front.  He knew what he was doing. The cop initiated the altercation.  The car in front was driving agressively, but a good judge would likely nail the cop for failing to yield. permalink parent award report block reply LineInTheSand 2 points 2 days ago You should probably read up on your state laws and take a driver's education course.  The driver changing lanes must wait for a safe opening before changing lanes.  The key words are highlighted.  Any opening is not sufficient.  Changing lanes without sufficient room for the other vehicles to maintain a safe following distance is not safe or legal. Edit: Here is a video with the first incident being similar to the one posted by OP .  The police ruled the driver changing lanes was completely at fault. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 -43 points 3 days ago Ok that\u2019s what an asshole does.  He caused the entire thing by being an asshole driver. I fucking hate fat idiot asshole drivers in their oversized trucks that they don\u2019t even need, but buy to prove how tough they are.  Fuck that guy . There was plenty of room to let him merge without hitting him.  Total idiots both of them . permalink parent award report block reply Doritalos 23 points 3 days ago And I hate punks that think they can just cut someone off. If he isn't going to let you pass, then you need to slow and change lanes behind him. What I hate are people who speed up after you hit the indicator knowing you are going to change lanes. That wasn't the case here but it happens in the US, I don't see this behavior in other countries. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... SaltiTaralli 21 points 3 days ago So you're one of the countless assholes who tries to muscle their way into a lane instead of SAFELY MERGING AND WAITING YOUR TURN. LEARN TO DRIVE.

If I\u2019m nice enough and there\u2019s plenty of room I might let you over. Otherwise retake your driving test and take a number.

The driver of the truck intentionally cut him off and HIT the merging driver.  If you have 10 car lengths in front of you and a car in the other lane is moving ahead of you and needs to merge because of construction blocking the lane..  and if you accelerate and block that car merging by hitting their rear panel..  then you are a fucking asshole. permalink parent award report block reply SirPokeSmottington 13 points 3 days ago You're the fucking asshole. YOU PULL IN BEHIND OTHER VEHICLES, YOU STUPID CUNT. permalink parent award report block reply yummy_yumm_yumms 5 points 3 days ago He should have left the house earlier, moron. Just because your lane is ending/obstructed, doesn't make it my problem. Maybe you need to go back to drivers ed to learn how to drive, cause you clearly don't understand. permalink parent award report block reply view 8 more comments... TGNX 2 points 3 days ago An asshole who is in the right. permalink parent award report block reply NotInFormation 8 points 3 days ago 102% of the time I approach a lane closure people like the jogger attempt to use every last inch of the lane being closed to pass everyone who has merged properly and then shove their nose in like this. permalink parent award report block reply TRexScrotum 3 points 3 days ago Here in Chicago people do that and it\u2019s infuriating because there\u2019s a truck with or a trailered GIANT FLASHING ARROW that you can see ALLLLL the way down the street. But no, lemme wait until I almost hit the thing and then try to get over. Absolute idiots, can\u2019t wait to get out of here. permalink parent award report block reply NotInFormation 2 points 2 days ago To where? In the meantime sometimes people arrange themselves in a staggered pattern to occupy two lanes, and then traffic flows smoothly -- and usually the aggro people relax a bit before everything opens up or maybe they realize they didn't 'lose' that much time anyway.  I neither affirm nor deny participating in such erratic behavior :p permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

The cop is lucky, and also a VERY quick draw!  This was an immensely satisfying video to watch!!! permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 -21 points 3 days ago No he didnt.  The guy was trying to merge over to avoid construction and the \u201coff duty cop\u201d would not let him.  Thats asshole driving on his part which caused this. permalink parent award report block reply DeepStateParasite 21 points 3 days ago No, the guy who had to merge because of the construction needed to brake and merge safely even if he wanted to cut in there.  You don't actually get to run into the car next to you to 'force merge'.  Then the at-fault  fucker sucker-punched the guy from behind and was clearly going to shoot him, so fortunately the pickup driver was able to discourage him with the use of hastily punched holes. Fuck that goat-turd-haired thug. permalink parent award report block reply redinmn -9 points 3 days ago Nope, depending on the state, you are required to yield to those whose lane is ending. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 -14 points 3 days ago You must be blind.  There was like 10 car lengths between this stupid asshole and the Car in Front of him.  Instead of letting the guy merge there he cut him off and hit him.  That\u2019s asshole behavior.  I wish they shot each other would be a good outcome. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... makersmarx 11 points 3 days ago Agree, but the nog should have slowed down and got behind him since the truck driver had the right of way. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 -5 points 3 days ago But the truck driver accelerated and intentionally rammed the back of the merging driver.  I don\u2019t care about the guy who got shot because fuck him for pulling a gun in Road rage.  But the driver here is a fucking asshole.  And if he\u2019s driving like like this then I\u2019m not surprised he got a gun pulled on him and sooner than later he\u2019ll probably get his cap peeled. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

When there's no space left, he finally pulls in and white guy is so freaking close because he's being a prick that they play bumper cars. I have no problem with pulling over and having words at that point. Black guy then chimps out, whips out a weapon, and makes his bad day into his last day by playing FAFO games. Neither man is the \"good guy\" in this. The white guy provoked the fight by driving like a total as..hat.

Fuck him. permalink parent award report block reply neomt 4 points 3 days ago Not his fucking problem.  It's on the merging car to change lanes safely. See #1 about it not being his fucking problem. See 1 and 2.  The black guy should be apologizing for going into an occupied lane, making contact. Hey, 1 out of 4 ain't bad in today's education system. permalink parent award report block reply JBlaze056 4 points 3 days ago 2 fat fucks both acting like assholes and they both have guns.

Otherwise, yeah, just let them merge and bitch about it. permalink parent award report block reply DrJosephWarren 6 points 3 days ago If he was planning on using it, Marley should have emerged from the car with his gun drawn. Fumbling around in your picket for your piece is lacking. permalink parent award report block reply MAGA_NRG 22 points 3 days ago Don't have to by law. Why didn't the guy just slow down and get in behind him. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 8 points 3 days ago There was plenty of room to merge in at first. Looks like a skill issue. Regardless, it's the responsibility of the merger to merge safely. permalink parent award report block reply Hanging_Chad 4 points 3 days ago looks like he went for it but then the front car braked so he had to brake. either way, he was likely high on weed permalink parent award report block reply MAGA_mantis 5 points 3 days ago Why didn't the victim learn how to not take cuts ? permalink parent award report block reply IAmNotAnAutist 2 points 3 days ago Because fuck you, that's why. permalink parent award report block reply M1kes_Cock 5 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply RuleoVicus 4 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply RuleoVicus 4 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply RuleoVicus 4 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply RuleoVicus 4 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply RuleoVicus 4 points 3 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments...

Once he enters the lane he has the right of way.  He does not have to occupy the entire lane.  The cop moved way left so he could pull along side and bump the rear right side of the car in front.  He knew what he was doing. The cop initiated the altercation.  The car in front was driving agressively, but a good judge would likely nail the cop for failing to yield. permalink parent award report block reply LineInTheSand 2 points 2 days ago You should probably read up on your state laws and take a driver's education course.  The driver changing lanes must wait for a safe opening before changing lanes.  The key words are highlighted.  Any opening is not sufficient.  Changing lanes without sufficient room for the other vehicles to maintain a safe following distance is not safe or legal. Edit: Here is a video with the first incident being similar to the one posted by OP .  The police ruled the driver changing lanes was completely at fault. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 -43 points 3 days ago Ok that\u2019s what an asshole does.  He caused the entire thing by being an asshole driver. I fucking hate fat idiot asshole drivers in their oversized trucks that they don\u2019t even need, but buy to prove how tough they are.

Total idiots both of them . permalink parent award report block reply Doritalos 23 points 3 days ago And I hate punks that think they can just cut someone off. If he isn't going to let you pass, then you need to slow and change lanes behind him. What I hate are people who speed up after you hit the indicator knowing you are going to change lanes. That wasn't the case here but it happens in the US, I don't see this behavior in other countries. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

Once he enters the lane he has the right of way.  He does not have to occupy the entire lane.  The cop moved way left so he could pull along side and bump the rear right side of the car in front.  He knew what he was doing. The cop initiated the altercation.  The car in front was driving agressively, but a good judge would likely nail the cop for failing to yield. permalink parent award report block reply LineInTheSand 2 points 2 days ago You should probably read up on your state laws and take a driver's education course.  The driver changing lanes must wait for a safe opening before changing lanes.  The key words are highlighted.  Any opening is not sufficient.  Changing lanes without sufficient room for the other vehicles to maintain a safe following distance is not safe or legal.

The police ruled the driver changing lanes was completely at fault. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 -43 points 3 days ago Ok that\u2019s what an asshole does.

If he isn't going to let you pass, then you need to slow and change lanes behind him. What I hate are people who speed up after you hit the indicator knowing you are going to change lanes.
