Hikedelics 2 points 6 days ago In most states you can. For legal purposes your vehicle is considered an extension of your home and that brings a lot of protection for self defense along with it. The fact that those trucks actually have sleeping quarters built in only reinforces that argument. You aren\u2019t supposed to bring in guns from out of state into New York BUT there are protections for people passing through. So if your destination is somewhere in the state, that\u2019s a no go, but if you\u2019re on your way to say Vermont or Maine or something you can bring your guns with you. Even if you have to stop over night. I would imagine that would apply to most truckers. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago GOD BLESS TEXAS!! permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments... Fresnor 42 points 6 days ago All truckers should be armed.  That is allowed by the 2nd Amendment, as well as reciprocity.  States need to be fined and officials arrested for violating these laws. permalink award report block reply pickleball_jones 21 points 6 days ago The officer is mistaken here. Your truck cab is your \u201chome\u201d and is legally protectable. Your trailer, that is not a fifth wheel or camper, is not legally recognized as your home in this situation. If the paperwork gets filed wrong you are going to prison if you shoot someone for breaking into your trailer full of overly insured consumer goods. Not worth it trucker bros. permalink award report block reply deleted 14 points 6 days ago Build_Back_Bankrupt 17 points 6 days ago What if they have property that I rightfully bought and paid for? permalink parent award report block reply Maganifice7 8 points 6 days ago Icwutudithere permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 8 points 6 days ago kek permalink parent award report block reply Taylor3006 5 points 6 days ago Understand there is no \"legal\" homicide in Texas. What you have are lawful uses of deadly force, used in specific instances that are defenses to the charge of homicide/murder. And they are quite specific. But yes, it is a defense to use deadly force to protect or retrieve your property if someone is in possession of it illegally. Almost every case goes in front of a grand jury as a safeguard against abuse. AND you have prosecutors who will sometimes refuse to go after people even if the grand jury says there is enough evidence that a crime may have been committed. permalink parent award report block reply STRONGLYWORDEDLETTER 1 points 6 days ago No you cannot. permalink parent award report block reply Jack_HinsonTN 8 points 6 days ago He's not an officer either.

The only defense that mentions the time of day is \"criminal mischief at night\" which is pretty broad. You can not use force to stop some felonies like passing bad checks, bribery, embezzlement, etc. Deadly force can be used to stop crimes against people or property, felonies or not. Just remember that every case is held to a \"reasonable man\" standard. If you shoot someone for picking a flower on your property or kill some kid who is TP'ing your house, would a reasonable man have done the same thing under the same circumstances? There is a reason we call them \"defenses\" and not something else. It is just a defense in court. permalink parent award report block reply lul_cheto 1 points 5 days ago Felonies sure, but im speaking about simple theft. permalink parent award report block reply YaharaRiver 2 points 6 days ago Depends! In Wisconsin, the Castle Doctrine applies to all outbuildings if they are part of the residential lot and devoted to residential use under Wisconsin Statute \u00a7 895.07(1)(h). This includes structures like garages, porches, basements, driveways, sidewalks, patios, and fences\u2014areas typically under the homeowner\u2019s exclusive control. The key factor is whether the area is functionally tied to the home and used in connection with residential life.

For legal purposes your vehicle is considered an extension of your home and that brings a lot of protection for self defense along with it. The fact that those trucks actually have sleeping quarters built in only reinforces that argument. You aren\u2019t supposed to bring in guns from out of state into New York BUT there are protections for people passing through. So if your destination is somewhere in the state, that\u2019s a no go, but if you\u2019re on your way to say Vermont or Maine or something you can bring your guns with you. Even if you have to stop over night. I would imagine that would apply to most truckers. permalink parent award report block reply\nSicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago GOD BLESS TEXAS!! permalink parent award report block reply\nFresnor 42 points 6 days ago All truckers should be armed.
