Did the GOP lift a finger to help any Republicans in any of these races? All I saw was Scott Presler and X pundits. How about all Republicans unite to push President Trump's platform on overdrive so midterms feature secure elections and a shattered Democrat party with half their leaders behind bars. Then Massie's wishlist can be addressed with a vengeance. permalink award report block reply SanityGumby 12 points 7 days ago All of the Republican candidates had tds permalink parent award report block reply 1_Badcop 3 points 7 days ago Seriously? \" all Republicans\"?

They weight voting for things like \"We Declare: Yay puppies!\" the same as all other legislation. They don't weight up issues like him voting for unlimited funds for Biden with higher weight. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 1 points 6 days ago It must be because he always votes with democrats so by effect it\u2019s impossible for him to score 100% on any freedom scoring that\u2019s real. permalink parent award report block reply Stlpoolguy 1 points 6 days ago The mf'er has voted on D dogshit in the past, and while the Trump budget isn't perfect, it's a step in the right direction.

MAGA Inc was started with $20 million from Trump's very own Save America PAC. permalink parent award report block reply TrancePhreak 2 points 6 days ago Sure, but that doesn't take away from Jeff Yass, a pro-Israel donor, funding him. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 0 points 6 days ago Wow. So Jeff Yass is an anti-semite? He clearly funds anti-Zionism. permalink parent award report block reply TrancePhreak 1 points 6 days ago He funds messaging that drives up donations to Zionist PAC's. It's an old trick used by AIPAC and others.

Should do that.\nAnyways. permalink award report block reply deleted 0 points 7 days ago anotherthing -1 points 7 days ago He voted with his party 13 times in September 2025 alone. You can look it up. Congressional record is public, and ignorance is a choice. https://massie.house.gov/voterecord/ Honoring the life and legacy of Charles \"Charlie\" James Kirk. GRID Power Act National Coal Council Reestablishment Act Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act District of Columbia Policing Protection Act District of Columbia Judicial Nominations Reform Act Honoring Our Heroes Act of 2025 Territorial Response and Access to Veterans\u2019 Essential Lifecare Act Stop Illegal Entry Act of 2025 Personnel Oversight and Shift Tracking Act of 2025 Shared Property Agency Collaboration and Engagement Act of 2025 Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act of 2025 FMS-Only List Review Act And this doesn't count consideration voting and other procedural votes, just the votes to pass things. permalink parent award report block reply asiandood 0 points 6 days ago Stop Illegal Entry Act of 2025 = defacto amnesty for illegals. Come on, everything you listed does nothing and some are already ILLEGAL, yet why do you need to pass something else?  Its already ILLEGAL. He voted against securing the border and building the wall TWICE. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 6 days ago He cosponsored a bill in 2023 to build a border wall, paying for it by cutting UN funds. He's on board with it when you cut spending from one thing in order to fund it. You guys don't seem to get how bad of a situation our debt is. Our debt is $38T. Our GDP is only $28T. Our spending is around $7T. Our revenue is around $5T. Our deficit is around $2T even with tariffs. The only reason our currency hasn't fallen off a cliff is because it's the defacto currency for trade. If the BRICS nations could actually trust one another, and it replaced the dollars, we'd be in a hyper-inflation death spiral. We currently spend as much on interest on that debt as we do on medicare. We spend 27% more on interest on the debt as we do Defense. Two years ago, interest on the debt was the same as Defense in terms of spending. That's only going up. And the GOP led Congress and Trump are pushing Biden Era spending levels. The GOP used to talk about balancing the budget and cutting spending. It's been years since they've done that. permalink parent award report block reply asiandood 0 points 6 days ago Everything he DOES is on purpose that he knows it will never pass so he can virtue signal as \"principled\". He doesn't care about spending.  Here's an amazing comment I found on a youtube post glazing Massie: THOMAS MASSIE delivered the DECIDING VOTE (7-6) to move the \"Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023\" out of the House Rules Committee to allow it to come to a full vote in the House. The following day, the \"Principled\" Thomas Massie voted YES to pass this bill, which SUSPENDED the debt ceiling and allowed UNLIMITED BORROWING\nuntil January 1, 2025. He alone had the power to kill that deal in Committee, if he truly cared, yet he passed on that opportunity. That's right. Massie essentially handed Biden a blank check and said \"SPEND AWAY.\" Massie doesn't care about debt, he doesn't care about spending, and he is NOT \"principled.\" https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/debt-ceiling-deal-updates.html Massie's social media in the past and receipts were posted here in the past that Massie did not want to be responsible for a govt shutdown under Biden. permalink parent award report block reply TrancePhreak 0 points 7 days ago Tell Massie to quit blocking Trump's agenda. permalink award report block reply Darkpoisonousshaddow 0 points 7 days ago Why do people hate this guy? I can't imagine anyone not agreeing with these points. permalink award report block reply Mhmm2MoreWeeks -1 points 7 days ago None of this is accurate. permalink award report block reply captflerbus -2 points 7 days ago none of these things are happening guy is a dope permalink award report block reply RyanKeyOh -2 points 7 days ago Eat a dick massie permalink award report block reply tingo999 -10 points 7 days ago What part of not allowing Muslims to dominate Israel is putting Israel before the USA? What is the USA doing in supporting Israel that is harming the USA? Israel is part of Christian history. This dumb fuck is telling us to remove the USA military dominance? Which would allow all of the other global militaries to dominate the world? This guy is a dumb fuck you're all dumb fucks. This is the end of the USA and the world. The USA needs to stay dominate, the USA needs to stop Muslims from dominating every country in the world. This is fucking retarded. permalink award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 9 points 7 days ago The physical land of Israel is where most of the Bible takes place, true. The present occupants, not so much. Their religion not the Father of Christianity; Christianity isn't a derivative branch of Judaism. In fact, it's the other way around -- Judaism is a tyrannical, heretical branch of the original faith given to the children of Adam, which branch has actively suppressed the root. permalink parent award report block reply Tiger5468 -2 points 7 days ago Absolutely correct. But it looks like Mohammad, Mohammad, Mohammad, and Muhammod (variant spelling of Mohammed), all downvoted your post permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 -11 points 7 days ago How are they putting Israel before America? Is it the on gojng contracts with Israels military? Is it the exchange for advanced tech we get from Israel? You guys keep saying this stupid old trope and all I see is the cheese and whine. Come on ladies do better. Come up with SOMETHING, shit. permalink award report block reply Jaybone86 11 points 7 days ago Ffs you can\u2019t be serious with this shit.

We've given them an average of $3 Billion in tax payer money every year for the last 30 years, while they have free healthcare and subsidized higher education.

You are talking to someone with an intelligence level slightly above a slug you can\u2019t call missing an invasion force 10k strong a mistake and be credible. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 1 points 6 days ago Yes Egypt did warn Israel that \u201can explosion\u201d or major escalation was imminent from Gaza a few days before October\u202f7. I agree with you. However, the warning was general rather than specific. Israel denies receiving a detailed operational warning. If you are using this for argument or discussion, you should note both the existence of the warning and the ambiguity surrounding its specificity and Israel\u2019s response. Don't u think? permalink parent award report block reply Jaybone86 1 points 6 days ago Thinking the armed forces should have been on alert isn\u2019t asking much.   Israel had other intelligence agencies telling them something was coming they also had the SIM card activation that they saw in volume right before the attacks.  Failing to change the alert level of the armed forces on just this alone is unforgivable much less what their own intelligence agency likely saw. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 1 points 6 days ago That's not what yhe warning said. permalink parent award report block reply\nChyNahAzzWhole1 37 points 7 days ago Stop being MIGA and start supporting MAGA. permalink award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 12 points 7 days ago It\u2019s not even a shellacking, lmao.

What do we get in return other than dragged into their conflicts to spend over $4 trilion on a decades long occupation just to give the country back to the people we got into war with in the first place? permalink parent award report block reply\nAgent_86 -5 points 7 days ago What does helping an Ally have to with putting Israel first? permalink parent award report block reply Jaybone86 9 points 7 days ago What\u2019s been done on the home front?

You are talking to someone with an intelligence level slightly above a slug you can\u2019t call missing an invasion force 10k strong a mistake and be credible. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 1 points 6 days ago Yes Egypt did warn Israel that \u201can explosion\u201d or major escalation was imminent from Gaza a few days before October\u202f7. I agree with you. However, the warning was general rather than specific. Israel denies receiving a detailed operational warning. If you are using this for argument or discussion, you should note both the existence of the warning and the ambiguity surrounding its specificity and Israel\u2019s response. Don't u think? permalink parent award report block reply Jaybone86 1 points 6 days ago Thinking the armed forces should have been on alert isn\u2019t asking much.   Israel had other intelligence agencies telling them something was coming they also had the SIM card activation that they saw in volume right before the attacks.  Failing to change the alert level of the armed forces on just this alone is unforgivable much less what their own intelligence agency likely saw. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 1 points 6 days ago That's not what yhe warning said. permalink parent award report block reply\nAgent_86 1 points 6 days ago Yes Egypt did warn Israel that \u201can explosion\u201d or major escalation was imminent from Gaza a few days before October\u202f7.
