That kind of self-serving bullshit just kills momentum on Arctic Frost investigations. Instead of using a momentous scandal to call for justice they turn it into a money grab. Disgusting.

Retroactive to Jan 1, 2022, it safeguards legislative independence against executive overreach, directly addressing DOJ/FBI probes like "Arctic Frost" (2020 election/Jan 6). Building on bipartisan Speech or Debate Clause precedents , this targeted protection deters warrantless surveillance and upholds Congress’s constitutional role. Legally sound —Congress routinely waives immunity via CR riders with no Byrd Rule violation. House GOP concerns focus on process, not validity; a standalone vote could expand this shield to the House. Smart, proactive policy delivered efficiently. permalink award report block reply grenades_and_ham 1 points 4 hours ago lol, a little line added to fatten up their wallets with taxpayer money.
