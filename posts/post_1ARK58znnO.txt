Same reason they won't fix the loopholes in the tax code. They benefit from it too... permalink parent award report block reply Zippythekid 7 points 4 days ago Now that kind of shit pisses me off. I just bought myself a new pair of shoes. I paid $42 for them and they were the first pair I’ve bought in 3 years. I have cut my own hair for 30 years, I have cut my 26 year old son’s hair every haircut but three since he was born. I cut my wife’s hair. The same people who are on snap benefits have the extra money to get their eyebrows tweezed? These same people would look at me with a house and a small cabin in Maine and say how privileged I am. But the only reason we have those things is we shop at thrift stores and take care of our own needs in other places. We are not privileged, we are blessed and have priorities. permalink award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 6 points 4 days ago Any woman can learn to tweeze her own brows, that's just ridiculous. We can do our own mani/pedis, too. Most of us learn these things as teens. If you choose to pay someone else do them that's fine (unless you're on government handouts) but if you can't do them for yourself as an adult woman you messed up somewhere. I know some older women who pay to have these things done because their hands are arthritic and they're no longer able to do it themselves but they pay for it and they aren't on welfare. permalink parent award report block reply 26magarat 7 points 4 days ago First world problems permalink award report block reply HillarysFUPA 6 points 4 days ago 0th world problems permalink parent award report block reply TexasBrowncoat 6 points 4 days ago "You gonna buy eyebrow treatment?"

Ugly people using tax dollars to try and be less ugly.  Last week it was ‘starving people’ who happened to be as big as a fucking bus.  The week before was ‘old people’ who were going to loose their health care, except they are all in their 50’s and retired 15 year early because they could live off our tax dollars.

She works occasionally. I've noticed her pattern she'll work long enough to qualify for 6 months of unemployment - then take a vacation....wash rinse repeat. No marketable skills to speak of. Though she frys amazing chicken wings. I can't fry anything I'm just inept. So I offer to buy her some wings if she'll share some with me. Since I know she's a single "struggling" mom I end up buying her a lot of meat. She's very grateful but she tells me I could have used her SNAP, and if I every need to she's got a huge balance. What the actual fuck? I told her please to save her benefits for her kids. Half the time they are at my house hungry so I always made an assumption they only had top ramen in the house. These are not people on the verge of starvation. permalink award report block reply Rango 2 points 4 days ago But mah weaves! permalink award report block reply redinmn 2 points 4 days ago If they have $100 to do their eyebrows, they dont need snap/ebt.

Zippythekid 7 points 4 days ago Now that kind of shit pisses me off. I just bought myself a new pair of shoes. I paid $42 for them and they were the first pair I’ve bought in 3 years. I have cut my own hair for 30 years, I have cut my 26 year old son’s hair every haircut but three since he was born. I cut my wife’s hair. The same people who are on snap benefits have the extra money to get their eyebrows tweezed? These same people would look at me with a house and a small cabin in Maine and say how privileged I am. But the only reason we have those things is we shop at thrift stores and take care of our own needs in other places. We are not privileged, we are blessed and have priorities. permalink award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 6 points 4 days ago Any woman can learn to tweeze her own brows, that's just ridiculous.

If you choose to pay someone else do them that's fine (unless you're on government handouts) but if you can't do them for yourself as an adult woman you messed up somewhere. I know some older women who pay to have these things done because their hands are arthritic and they're no longer able to do it themselves but they pay for it and they aren't on welfare. permalink parent award report block reply

I've noticed her pattern she'll work long enough to qualify for 6 months of unemployment - then take a vacation....wash rinse repeat. No marketable skills to speak of. Though she frys amazing chicken wings. I can't fry anything I'm just inept. So I offer to buy her some wings if she'll share some with me. Since I know she's a single "struggling" mom I end up buying her a lot of meat. She's very grateful but she tells me I could have used her SNAP, and if I every need to she's got a huge balance. What the actual fuck? I told her please to save her benefits for her kids. Half the time they are at my house hungry so I always made an assumption they only had top ramen in the house.
