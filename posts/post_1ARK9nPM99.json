Targeting this latter group will make it very easy to turn America into a 80-90% White country again, and it also means that people like Letitia James, Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, etc. can be stripped of their citizenship and deported. permalink award report block reply Ostia 6 points 3 hours ago Will never happen. We\u2019d be kicked out of power before we could even get any of it accomplished, due to flagrantly violating the constitution, the moment we started the policy of deporting legal residents and citizens. permalink parent award report block reply Elencher 6 points 3 hours ago Then we die, and that's why the future is balkanization. If we can't make this happen through the existing governmental structures, then those structures are on borrowed time. We'll have to reform along different lines and redefine citizenship. permalink parent award report block reply SutopSutolf 1 points 2 hours ago No. We just die. Good luck. permalink parent award report block reply Flying_Pede_121 2 points 1 hour ago lol, history says otherwise. The Spanish kicked the Muslims out.

Went from 13 states to 50 states. Sure 250 years ago you could say certain things. Now you just overwhelm the population and use their laws against them and soon you overrule them. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia -1 points 2 hours ago Yeah, man, we must destroy the constitution to save it. So much for all the constitution talk we\u2019ve spent decades spouting. permalink parent award report block reply Elencher 3 points 2 hours ago See you're retarded like my cousin. I tried this though experiment on him. So these muslims are all given legal citizenship, and they all vote legally, and they all vote for sharia, then clearly we must accept sharia because that's the constitutional process right? No, not at all. The constitution isn't fucking magic, it's downstream of the culture. If the culture has been polluted then the constitution doesn't work anymore. Take for example the concept of jury of your peers. If your peers are blacks who will punish all whites and acquit all blacks, then does this principle work anymore? permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments...

I, for one, do not believe the constitution is a suicide pact permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 0 points 2 hours ago Cool, be sure to let the democrats know that possibility is on the table for them as well and say goodbye to your guns, gas vehicles, and freedom of speech. You\u2019re every single thing the worst of the left accuses us of being. You justify their existence. permalink parent award report block reply mikejones 1 points 2 hours ago The thing is it is way hard to deport compared to let in. When it comes to deporting, those who got in illegally will use our system against us to stop deporting. We are basically screwed. permalink parent award report block reply PatriotGames 1 points 1 hour ago A lot of the people in that video were born in Dearborn MI. Just saying... the problem is already harder than you imagine. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 1 points 17 minutes ago You basically have to take over the courts to the point that where someone like Clarence Thomas looks like a moderate, or even a liberal compared to the people to the right of him. permalink parent award report block reply GoldenEarz 20 points 3 hours ago Where are all the American flags? permalink award report block reply MEME-SUPREME 23 points 3 hours ago They burned all of them. permalink parent award report block reply DeplorachuIChooseYou 16 points 3 hours ago This country is looking more and more like the UK permalink award report block reply Oleander 5 points 3 hours ago It's worse. The demographics are much worse. Only thing that's better is that we aren't getting locked up for memes yet. And sure we have guns too, but that hasn't stopped the invasion. We just end up with a lot of armed feral niggrs and terrorists and that's it really. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 2 points 2 hours ago Any and all freedoms we still have over UK will go with the next Democrat president and Congress. They see UK abusing its own people to protect invaders and get extremely jealous permalink parent award report block reply Tyrone_biggums 1 points 1 hour ago Definitely not worse permalink parent award report block reply Oleander 1 points 1 hour ago We are a lot less white than Europe. And that's just right now - how about when a Democrat gets in next, and we have mass amnesty and abolished ICE? permalink parent award report block reply mikejones 0 points 2 hours ago You talk to anyone that grew up in the country and then moved to the city. They will be like I grew up around 100% white people and after moving to the city, now I go places and I am the only white person there. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 4 points 3 hours ago UK is just where we'll be in ten years tops. They jumped ahead of us because we bucked and elected Trump instead of Uniparty A vs Uniparty B. Trump isnt perfect by any means but one thing he did was throw a wrench in their plans to swarm the country with brown parasites. But one of our biggest cities just fell to a communist Muslim just like London fell before.  It will take a lot of work and violence to recover that city, but it's doubtful as anyone with means will flee the city in the next few years as the diversity and socialism hot their pocketbook or their faces via sucker punch. While you can point and laugh , that only means the city falls further and further to the left and we'll all eventually be subsidizing it via federal bailouts. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 13 points 3 hours ago Well to be accurate there could be those with refugee status which is currently being revoked by the Trump administration (eg Syria) But yes legal immigration is a problem just like illegal immigration. permalink award report block reply FusionBlack 23 points 3 hours ago Legal is even worse.  You can deport illegals. permalink parent award report block reply Roadcruiser2 17 points 3 hours ago Chinese American Pede here. There are too many hostile foreigners. We need to suspend immigration. permalink parent award report block reply deleted -3 points 3 hours ago NadlersNads 5 points 3 hours ago Sorry about your future edited gene pool permalink parent award report block reply CheeseAndOnion 3 points 2 hours ago Im sure she is rubbing off on your son if ya know what i mean lol permalink parent award report block reply SpellingContable 2 points 3 hours ago She probably does. permalink parent award report block reply SutopSutolf 2 points 2 hours ago You better hope she rubs him hard. Might be the only future he has. permalink parent award report block reply DeaduponArousal 7 points 3 hours ago All immigration involving non white Christians needs to go. permalink parent award report block reply GatoradeJeb 3 points 2 hours ago And trump just said he wants to import more h1b like in the pic because americans too dumb to build missiles permalink parent award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty 13 points 3 hours ago Antifa, middle east division permalink award report block reply airborne3502 9 points 3 hours ago Glad we fought them over there so they didn't come here. permalink award report block reply ninabobby 3 points 3 hours ago Bomb more countries!

Why are these people increasing in numbers in Texas? When Trump made his mid-east tour did he make some deal to allow and not deport these vermin? Punjeets and Muslims never seem to be the ones getting deported. There is a simple solution to this problem but our government won't do anything about it. I'm sorry,  I'm having a hard time understanding why Trump and his administration refuse to do shit about this. permalink award report block reply NutPsaki 2 points 2 hours ago Because he\u2019s a cucked boomer pussy permalink parent award report block reply Treefiddydiddy 0 points 1 hour ago with his nuts firmly in net and yahoos fist sadly permalink parent award report block reply fightfightfightx 6 points 3 hours ago thank the bergs, steins, and roths for this shit starting to think the history books were all projection, because no one today even comes close to how evil they are permalink award report block reply NutPsaki 3 points 2 hours ago Starting to believe the exact opposite of what history books tell us permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 6 points 2 hours ago Denaturalize and deport them anyway.

Turns out the truth was \u2018fight them over there so we can declare them all asylum seekers and import them\u2019 permalink award report block reply TheMustacheBandit 5 points 3 hours ago Disgusting and horrific.  We are cooked. permalink award report block reply mikejones 1 points 2 hours ago America was lucky. Huge, surrounded by water. Canada is frozen so not many people lived there early on. Mexico was Mexico. Then over last 40 years bribes happened and many people came over and jobs left. Then 40 years later if you try to do anything about it you are called a racist and say you are breaking the law. So there is no winning. permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 5 points 3 hours ago FIGHT BACK. It begins by getting together a group of like-minded patriots. Start with your church and your friends and grow from there. Set up a phone tree. Use burner phones. Don't text. Organize, coordinate, think, be creative! You already know how to respond to their street-blocking \"prayers.\" Pick a name or organization and get involved. permalink award report block reply LetFreedomRing 2 points 3 hours ago They made Christians weak by believing that Jesus would welcome everyone... What happened to people who would have fought the Crusades in this day and age?? permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 1 points 29 minutes ago Don't believe the lying legacy media.

Whilst I never disagreed, I'm very sad that while some were watching what was happening here, they did nothing to stop this from also happening in America. permalink award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 2 points 1 hour ago This is a small part of the Detroit metro. The reason people don't care is because Arabs make better neighbors than the blacks in Detroit, and they are displacing the blacks.  It is actively making Detroit less of a shithole. permalink parent award report block reply Saxonlady 1 points 51 minutes ago Interesting. So when all the blacks are gone and it's just muslims and whites, do the whites know they will be displaced next? permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 43 minutes ago It's Michigan. Being \"displaced\" isn't the problem, farmland is cheap to expand. permalink parent award report block reply VladtheTickler 3 points 3 hours ago Thanks, Obama. permalink award report block reply dodgetimes2 1 points 2 hours ago As much as I fucking hate that faggot tranny lover this predates Obama. I\u2019m from the SE Michigan area and played sports against Dearborn back in the 90\u2019s. Even back then their HS football team were calling audibles in Arabic. Of course it\u2019s gotten even worse but this was happening before that Muslim faggot. permalink parent award report block reply VladtheTickler 1 points 1 hour ago There were some, but not nearly the numbers as in post-Bushjr/Obama.  Competing for a mayoral seat was unthinkable back then. permalink parent award report block reply CheeseAndOnion 0 points 2 hours ago Well he is Moslem after all what did u expect permalink parent award report block reply Owmyballz 3 points 2 hours ago Get them the fuck out of the United States now. permalink award report block reply Underpants 3 points 3 hours ago Can we build a wall around it? permalink award report block reply CT-PATRIOT 3 points 2 hours ago Commonly known as DearbornIstan Michigan permalink award report block reply Treefiddydiddy 2 points 1 hour ago gee thanks obummer etc permalink award report block reply CaptainWinston 2 points 3 hours ago Looks.

Americans have been conditioned to believe that if we fight back we're somehow racist. It's not racist to want to preserve the American way of life. It's not racist to fight people who want you dead. permalink award report block reply Oleander 2 points 3 hours ago I don't give a shit if it's racist anymore. The browns and blacks would gladly watch whites (who are a vanishing minority in this world) die. The fact that you or anyone cares whether it's \"racist\" is how we got here. The term \"racism\" is a weapon exclusively directed at whites and no one else. It is an albatross we must be free from immediately, or we will die. It's not hyperbole, the whole world and half of our own are rooting for our extinction. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 1 hour ago This is a small part of the Detroit metro. The reason people don't care is because Arabs make better neighbors than the blacks in Detroit, and they are displacing the blacks. It is actively making Detroit less of a shithole. permalink parent award report block reply bleeje OP 2 points 3 hours ago Thanks for sticky, mods permalink award report block reply SoL-Chi 2 points 1 hour ago Fn crazy. permalink award report block reply Rerun1Central 2 points 2 hours ago retards in Michigan say... 'but the middle eastern bakery is so good'... like fuck off we have perfectly good polish & greek bakeries all over metro detroit permalink award report block reply TexasBrowncoat 2 points 2 hours ago Naturalized citizenship can be revoked through a process called denaturalization, which typically occurs if an individual obtained citizenship by concealing material facts or through willful misrepresentation. Additionally, citizenship may be revoked if the individual is found to have committed certain crimes or affiliated with specific organizations that preclude naturalization. permalink award report block reply cherbui 2 points 2 hours ago legal invasion promoted by democrat party permalink award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 1 hour ago This is promoted by Republicans as well. permalink parent award report block reply Dev404 2 points 1 hour ago Our government has been subsidizing an invasion of our country while calling us racist if we don't let them do it. Feminism was their tool to get mainstream acceptance of this invasion. permalink award report block reply dudebro 2 points 1 hour ago \"Immigration is okay as long as it's legal!\" - boomer republicans permalink award report block reply mateus 2 points 2 hours ago Seeing this should as care the bejeebers out of everyone. permalink award report block reply Polarix 2 points 2 hours ago Future NYC permalink award report block reply FORMERCHILDSTAR 2 points 2 hours ago I don't see orthodox Islam as a religion, it's more of a subversive militant organization hiding as a religion. Secular Muslims are tolerable in numbers that can assimilate, but vast numbers of devout Muslims with ideals contrary to the USA Constitution and individual liberty are destructive to societal cohesion. permalink award report block reply newuser8 2 points 37 minutes ago I fucking hate boomers that allow this shit. permalink award report block reply TrumpWin 2 points 1 hour ago American people won't go for another Iraq so the deep state is bringing the invaders here permalink award report block reply Snek_Plissken 2 points 2 hours ago 40% of those residents are in SNAP.

They will put all their wives on snap. some of these fucks have 5 wives permalink parent award report block reply Snek_Plissken 1 points 2 hours ago At some point, the various AIs will stop answering questions regarding the severity of government programs. It\u2019s funny because the states are reimbursed for this and everyone pays for the democrat grift. permalink parent award report block reply America101 2 points 49 minutes ago This is really scary and the downfall of America. Muslins are taking over Minnesota, Texas and now New York. They have a plan and it is working. permalink award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 2 points 2 hours ago No reason for this. permalink award report block reply Skabliggum2 2 points 35 minutes ago I never understood why Michigan.
