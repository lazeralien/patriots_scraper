Lots of people hate the uniparty, but are still going to vote for one or the other. permalink award report block reply Bullet3250 2 points 6 days ago Yes. We are all waiting for a hero to rise and remove the criminals. permalink parent award report block reply DoMagnum 1 points 6 days ago Another way of saying they're retarded. Only1 side appears to be fighting the uniparty, while 1 side denies it exists. permalink parent award report block reply NamendaBiden 8 points 6 days ago Also a 22% increase in turnout in NJ vs the last gubernatorial election.  Which, also had the highest turnout ever at the time. permalink award report block reply Odyssey 4 points 6 days ago Time after time we have been saying to Trump that we deserve to lose if he doesn't go after election workers who rigged the previous elections. Does Trump realise how much experience they have gained in committing voter fraud in the past 5 years? permalink award report block reply Grindelwald 4 points 6 days ago Time to get the DOGE guys, the military or NSA intel tech guys and Omega4America to audit every election including primaries and funding. permalink award report block reply Darkpoisonousshaddow 3 points 6 days ago I thought Trump was going to blow the whole voter fraud shit to pieces? permalink award report block reply ceva 1 points 6 days ago I think we proved looooooong ago that these approval polls are terrible predictions for election results.

Audit. That's where there is court admissible evidence of election fraud. Until evidence that's on par with Maricopa's audit is presented to a court, every case will be thrown out. Again. You can argue logic and statistical impossibilities all you like, but a judge doesn't give a damn about theories UNTIL evidence, like a full forensic audit, is presented first and then you can present your theory, afterwards. It is up to the ACCUSER to present evidence, NOT the accused. It's only the ACCUSED when it's a feminist accusing a man of something he allegedly did, because feminism is ass-backwards and a marxist tool to destroy a functioning civiliation. permalink award report block reply\ncanadianhere 10 points 6 days ago There is a big difference between favourability and voting.
