You've wasted ten months and failed to bring in the expertise needed to speed the J6 investigation. You deserve all the criticism that's coming to you! Benny Johnson @bennyjohnson \u2022 1d DOJ Pardon Attorney Ed Martin says he spoke with Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino over the weekend, who gave him a very promising update on January 6th and the pipe bomber: \"I spoke to Bongino and he said 'We are in this completely.

The point is it's almost an entire year of the \"most transparent\" administration who was elected to exact revenge on the deep state.

I know it's not fashionable to have faith in anything these days, but I don't believe he left his multi-million dollar podcasting gig to go work for peanuts in government because he cares primarily about money. permalink parent award report block reply TheSwampThang 2 points 8 hours ago He has done nothing but cover up.
