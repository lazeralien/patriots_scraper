A lengthy process that can take up to 10 years. permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 4 days ago This is a bad article. First it says they become undocumented. Lower down an attorney says they are on a one year timer to file for asylum. Which is it? Am I expected to care enough to do homework? permalink award report block reply Trajano 3 points 4 days ago The article is correct. Once the status expires, they will have no work authorization and will need to leave. If they stay, they are here illegally and can be deported. If they file for asylum, they will remain legally in the country until their claim is processed and an immigration officer or judge rules on whether to approve or reject their asylum application. The twist  is that processing an asylum application takes U.S immigration a very long time because of Biden's open border policies, which have overflowed the system and created a huge backlog: \"The average wait time for cases in front of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is approximately 4.3 years, with some courts, such as the one in Omaha, Nebraska, reporting wait times approaching 6 years.\nIn some instances, cases may extend beyond 10 years due to the large number of pending cases\u2014over 1 million as of recent data\u2014with an average wait time of more than 1,364 days for those granted asylum in FY 2023.\" During that time, the applicants will receive a work authorization and a legal status to remain in the country until their asylum claims are resolved. The lawyer in the article speculates that they have a full year to apply (it may be true or not), but until they file the claim,  they are here illegally. Full disclaimer, I am not an immigration lawyer, but someone with more knowledge than I has explained the whole process to me. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 2 points 4 days ago Thanks for the details. permalink parent award report block reply stillbringingitback 1 points 4 days ago Venezuelans are, IMO, some of the more deserving refugees.  Obviously way way behind South African whites, but still better than black Africans or Middle Easterners. permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 7 points 4 days ago Maduro is a bad hombre and needs to go down, but there\u2019s several countries along the way that should be taking in Venezuelans seeking asylum before the US. permalink parent award report block reply JoinTheDiscussion 5 points 4 days ago They only come directly here for gibmedats and to make anchor babies permalink parent award report block reply stillbringingitback 2 points 4 days ago Agreed permalink parent award report block reply South_Florida_Guy OP 1 points 4 days ago Let them go to Colombia instead they're made for each other permalink parent award report block reply South_Florida_Guy OP 2 points 4 days ago Yeah I get that but we're full and we have our own problems to deal with.

A lengthy process that can take up to 10 years. permalink award report block reply\nMichalusmichalus 1 points 4 days ago This is a bad article. First it says they become undocumented. Lower down an attorney says they are on a one year timer to file for asylum. Which is it? Am I expected to care enough to do homework? permalink award report block reply Trajano 3 points 4 days ago The article is correct. Once the status expires, they will have no work authorization and will need to leave. If they stay, they are here illegally and can be deported. If they file for asylum, they will remain legally in the country until their claim is processed and an immigration officer or judge rules on whether to approve or reject their asylum application. The twist  is that processing an asylum application takes U.S immigration a very long time because of Biden's open border policies, which have overflowed the system and created a huge backlog: \"The average wait time for cases in front of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is approximately 4.3 years, with some courts, such as the one in Omaha, Nebraska, reporting wait times approaching 6 years.\nIn some instances, cases may extend beyond 10 years due to the large number of pending cases\u2014over 1 million as of recent data\u2014with an average wait time of more than 1,364 days for those granted asylum in FY 2023.\" During that time, the applicants will receive a work authorization and a legal status to remain in the country until their asylum claims are resolved. The lawyer in the article speculates that they have a full year to apply (it may be true or not), but until they file the claim,  they are here illegally. Full disclaimer, I am not an immigration lawyer, but someone with more knowledge than I has explained the whole process to me. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 2 points 4 days ago Thanks for the details. permalink parent award report block reply\nTrajano 3 points 4 days ago The article is correct.
