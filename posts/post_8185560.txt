87 After Charlie Kirk's assassination everything changed. Suddenly, TPUSA is getting captured by the messianic Christian wing. Kirk was not interested in Israel and was actually frustrated by the latest Gaza war and the human toll. Seems like the Trump administration knows more than they say. posted 7 hours ago by breadbaker 4 comments award share report block .

Every human being is capable of both great good and great evil. Lucifer’s tactics work by exploiting that truth. He doesn’t need to turn people into monsters overnight. He only needs to shift their perception, twist their understanding, and make them believe that evil is actually moral, rational, or even compassionate. When that happens, his work is done for him. Here’s the breakdown of his main tactics: Twisting truth into half-truths.
Lucifer rarely uses pure lies. He mixes truth with distortion so it sounds reasonable. For example, he’ll take Israel’s military actions, remove all context, and feed the world a story that paints defense as aggression. It sounds logical until you examine what’s missing. He did the same thing in Eden when he said, “Did God really say?” It was not outright denial, but distortion. Exploiting human pride.
He convinces people that they are morally superior to God’s Word. Pride blinds people into thinking they can define justice, love, and truth on their own. This leads entire movements to believe they are fighting for peace or equality while actually working against divine order. Pride is his favorite tool because it creates moral blindness. Using empathy without truth.
Lucifer weaponizes compassion. He knows people naturally feel sympathy for suffering, so he presents one side of a conflict as victims and the other as villains, even if reality is the opposite. He pushes people to feel rather than discern. That’s how he gets believers and unbelievers alike to side with darkness thinking they are doing good. Dividing through identity and ideology.
He fragments humanity into opposing tribes, political, racial, religious, and economic, so that unity becomes impossible. The more divided the world becomes, the easier it is for him to steer people toward blame instead of repentance. Hatred of Israel fits perfectly into this pattern because it feeds multiple ideological camps at once. Corrupting theology.
He doesn’t just attack through the secular world. He corrupts doctrine from within. He convinces pastors and teachers to spiritualize away Israel’s role, to treat God’s covenants as symbolic or obsolete. That weakens the believer’s understanding of God’s faithfulness and breaks the prophetic connection between Israel and Messiah’s return. Desensitizing through repetition.
Lucifer understands that constant exposure dulls moral awareness. When anti-Israel bias floods news cycles, classrooms, and entertainment, it becomes normal. People stop noticing the deception because they’ve heard it so often. Evil becomes ordinary, and that is one of his greatest victories. Turning good impulses into idols.
Even noble causes can become demonic tools when they replace God’s truth. Environmentalism, social justice, and humanitarianism are not evil in themselves, but when detached from God’s moral foundation, they become vehicles for rebellion. Lucifer always prefers corrupted good over obvious evil. Every tactic hinges on one goal: to move people away from truth while convincing them they are enlightened. That’s how he deceives nations into hating Israel, how he turns believers against one another, and how he sets the stage for open rebellion against God. It is psychological warfare on a global scale, but spiritual at its core. permalink award report block reply LiteraIIyHitIer 2 points 2 hours ago No one has to "deceive" people into hating Israel, their actions alone are enough.
