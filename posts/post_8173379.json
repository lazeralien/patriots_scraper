Nobody should be allowed entry without that. Put valid asylum seekers (the huge majority aren't) in camps or on an island until they can be vetted. permalink parent award report block reply White-tailed_Eagle 5 points 5 days ago If that illegal alien was actually working as a teacher, then the void left by their deportation would be filled by an American.

I hate the 'worst of the worst' strategy, it emboldens everyone else to believe they can stay. Raid daycares.  Snatch grandmas off the street.

It\u2019s kind of like how law enforcement officers don\u2019t need a warrant to arrest a bank robber while they\u2019re robbing a bank. permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 6 points 5 days ago It also means all arrests are criminal enforcement, so any signs/statements by state and local government against civil immigration enforcement are virtue signaling permalink parent award report block reply thehinac PRO 11 points 5 days ago Why the Dems don't like X. permalink award report block reply HellNoKameltoe 8 points 5 days ago Democrat is lying - so it's a day ending in \"y\" permalink award report block reply Prandogolio 2 points 5 days ago Sue them for a billion dollars every time. permalink parent award report block reply 3stepsahead 7 points 5 days ago Im sorry, dont these Congressman take an oath to uphold the constitution?

ICE should raid and shut down the entire daycare if they're hiring illegal aliens to be teachers. Foreign criminals who do not respect our borders and our laws should not be teaching children. permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 6 points 5 days ago The administration is facing heavy resistance from the district courts, state and local government, as well as the people themselves with respect to immigration enforcement in and around Chicago. You have unelected Obama/Biden judges determining that ICE and the Border Patrol is \u201clying\u201d about their depiction of events, and disinformation as you\u2019re seeing here when it comes to people getting arrested. If there was ever a case to invoke the Insurrection Act, send in federal troops to arrest elected officials (including federal judges) to restore order, it\u2019s here. permalink award report block reply blue5707 5 points 5 days ago All I care about is she gets a lifetime ban from EVER re-entering the US, in the future. permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 3 points 5 days ago If what leftists are saying about conditions in ICE detention facilities are remotely true, these criminal scumbags are getting their just desserts permalink parent award report block reply Bearing51 5 points 5 days ago ICE don't need a warrant to arrest illegal aliens, do they? permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 8 points 5 days ago Do you need a warrant to arrest someone in the process of robbing a bank? Of course not. Your probable cause is right in front of you. Their mere presence in the US is a criminal act. These agents have tools to help them figure out who to look for and where they\u2019re at. It\u2019s when the illegals start running/resisting that helps establish probable cause permalink parent award report block reply zooty 4 points 5 days ago Getting elected to public office is a popularity contest, not an intelligence test. permalink parent award report block reply OTher55 5 points 5 days ago His big problem seems to be it happened in front of kids.

I've gotten into the habit of going straight to the comments and the good news is regardless of the leftist news site or how pathetic they pander about poor fat illiterate non-english speaking Juanita and her gangbanging kids and criminal rapist boyfriend, the comments are easily 2 to 4X in favor of ICE; \"too bad not sad - get the fuck out\" permalink award report block reply FromTheTopRope 3 points 5 days ago Human shields. ICE shouldn't have to only go after the \"worst of the worst\" and should also go after the \"best of the best\" because there is no such thing as 'good illegal immigration'. permalink award report block reply CoffeeIsForClosers 3 points 5 days ago By this logic, we can all agree that it's okay to bomb Doctors without Borders since they aided a terrorist.

Trump said worst would be first, self-deport now, you have to go back. It's been a year since the election. We are past the first stages of the largest mass deportation effort in history. All illegal aliens would be wise to self deport. You have to go back. ICE is well funded and growing. America is ramping up deportations and shipping these foos outta here. Get out of our country. Go home and fix your own country. permalink award report block reply UltraMagaWA 3 points 5 days ago Don't forget to deport her spawns if she has some permalink award report block reply terribletwos 3 points 5 days ago Who gives a fuck. Shut down the daycare and deport all the children too. Stop playing THEIR game fucking retarded fucks. You let them set the conversation and wonder why everything is so hard. permalink award report block reply MAGA-2028 3 points 5 days ago They need to start arresting the masked antifa that are pretending to be ICE. We\u2019ve been targeting them one by one but the national guard needs to round them up. permalink award report block reply POTUS_DonnieJ 2 points 5 days ago Why do we continue to let our elected representatives knowingly and blatantly lie to us? Frankly I've maintained that government officials, be they elected (including candidates), appointed or hired, shouldn't be offered the same constitutional protections as private citizens. You shouldn't get to claim 1st Amendment while knowingly lying to the people to advance your agenda (this fucker right here, or Schiff claiming he has evidence of Russian collusion, and yes, even Bondi saying she has Epstein's files on her desk). You shouldn't get to claim the 5th if you're caught doing something bad while acting in an official capacity and are brought to testify (think Clinton pleading the 5th about her emails or Fauci about his kickbacks). Don't like it? Easy solution, don't go into government, remain a private citizens with the full protection of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. permalink award report block reply Bramage 2 points 5 days ago Hey mikey, you faggot lying fuck, buzz off. permalink award report block reply indigo_truther 2 points 5 days ago ICE heroically saves children when fugitive bursts into daycare permalink award report block reply ravonaf 2 points 5 days ago We live in a world where people in power lie and no one cares. You absolutely can not have a free country when anyone can say anything they want with authority and millions believe the lie. I can not see how this can be fixed. As far as I can see, this experiment in a free Republic has failed. We might as well wipe the board and start over from scratch. I see no other way. permalink award report block reply 2Clutch 2 points 5 days ago I wouldn't have given a shit if they did snatch her ass out of a daycare iN frOnT oF cHiLDrEN while she was working there.

GOOD. Here illegally? Make an example out of them, they\u2019re breaking the fucking LAW. Remember laws, anyone? permalink award report block reply surgeriot 1 points 5 days ago Too late, he already lied and no consequences will happen why thousands of people blindly believe what he said. Because we don't have the mechanism in place to remove news like this when it's blatantly proven false. permalink award report block reply Aoikaze2000 1 points 5 days ago Maybe we should let them think ICE is the new boogeyman? permalink award report block reply zooty 1 points 5 days ago Oh no, someone breaking the law arrested in front of children!

The Demonkrat who now has Rahm Emanuel's seat howls in protest, probably wants to set up a margarita date with her. permalink award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 5 days ago I.  Do.  Not.  Care. I don't care if they went in there guns blazing, as long as they nabbed the illegal. permalink award report block reply Keiichi81 1 points 5 days ago All day yesterday, the media was painting this as an angelic little school teacher who was in the middle of teaching class when evil white supremacist ICE agents burst in and dragged her out of the classroom at gunpoint in front of her sobbing schoolchildren. Now I find out not only was it not a school, not only was she never in a classroom, but she wasn't even an employee there and was instead a potentially dangerous fugitive who tried to gain entry to and hide inside a daycare while fleeing arrest. I'm sure if scared children were even present (which is a big \"if\" at this point) then they were probably just crying out of fear of some stranger trying to break in. Will the media be forced to issue a correction for the false coverage? Just kidding, we all know it'll never even be mentioned. permalink award report block reply IAmDisappoint 1 points 5 days ago Awww but it made such a nice headline!

Then I remember all the retards on this website that still believe Scott Pressler isn't a grifter. permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 2 points 5 days ago TBH, liberals are more susceptible to fake news than we are permalink parent award report block reply RedditStillSucks 2 points 5 days ago Very true.

GOOD. Here illegally? Make an example out of them, they\u2019re breaking the fucking LAW. Remember laws, anyone? permalink award report block reply\nsurgeriot 1 points 5 days ago Too late, he already lied and no consequences will happen why thousands of people blindly believe what he said. Because we don't have the mechanism in place to remove news like this when it's blatantly proven false. permalink award report block reply\nAoikaze2000 1 points 5 days ago Maybe we should let them think ICE is the new boogeyman? permalink award report block reply\nzooty 1 points 5 days ago Oh no, someone breaking the law arrested in front of children! Whatev.... hold on. That's exactly what I want. Good lesson. permalink award report block reply\nmcoulton 1 points 5 days ago Seems like she was working there and they knew she would be there and she ran inside, isn\u2019t the issue tat a \u201cworst of the worst\u201d is taking care of children permalink award report block reply\nasiatrails 1 points 5 days ago Illegal, runs away from ICE, ICE follows and captures. The Demonkrat who now has Rahm Emanuel's seat howls in protest, probably wants to set up a margarita date with her. permalink award report block reply\n2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 5 days ago I.  Do.  Not.  Care. I don't care if they went in there guns blazing, as long as they nabbed the illegal. permalink award report block reply\nKeiichi81 1 points 5 days ago All day yesterday, the media was painting this as an angelic little school teacher who was in the middle of teaching class when evil white supremacist ICE agents burst in and dragged her out of the classroom at gunpoint in front of her sobbing schoolchildren. Now I find out not only was it not a school, not only was she never in a classroom, but she wasn't even an employee there and was instead a potentially dangerous fugitive who tried to gain entry to and hide inside a daycare while fleeing arrest. I'm sure if scared children were even present (which is a big \"if\" at this point) then they were probably just crying out of fear of some stranger trying to break in. Will the media be forced to issue a correction for the false coverage? Just kidding, we all know it'll never even be mentioned. permalink award report block reply\nIAmDisappoint 1 points 5 days ago Awww but it made such a nice headline! Now, how are they going to call ICE fascists over this? permalink award report block reply\n95Rockytoby95 1 points 5 days ago Quigley is gay. And a liar. permalink award report block reply\nOodles 1 points 5 days ago These are the exact pieces of shit illegals we need deported immediately permalink award report block reply\nsomeguy7738 1 points 5 days ago Always the same shit from the left. It could have been a registered sex offender working as a teacher under false pretenses in order to molest children and they'd still whine about it \"ERMAGERD they arrested a TEACHER in front of CHILDREN!!!\" permalink award report block reply\nltbadpuppy 1 points 5 days ago Democrats already found out via the 'both sides' lie that even if there is video evidence of the event proving the leftist narrative is a lie, if they repeat the lie enough their base will simply believe them. permalink award report block reply\nBeat_to_Quarters 1 points 5 days ago Democrats using the Hamas public relations playbook. permalink award report block reply\nLunatic_Fringe_PhD 1 points 5 days ago Congresspeople LIE!?!?! I'm SHOCKED permalink award report block reply\nDoMagnum 1 points 5 days ago Dem pols lie because they have trained their intended audience to believe only lies and reflexively reject truth like a psychological gag reflex. permalink award report block reply\nAmannamedRJ 1 points 5 days ago Democrats just elected a man who wanted to kill his opponent and his opponents children right on the heels of a man being assassinated in front of his children And they mocked that man and his wife and his children ruthlessly. Frankly, kill yourself if you're offended by this. Fuck your fake outrage. permalink award report block reply\nTheSonOfGadsden 1 points 5 days ago A democrat lying?

Send them and their parents back if they\u2019re illegal. permalink award report block reply\nFredRedd 1 points 5 days ago Hey Quigley, how exactly was a car -IN YOUR DISTRICT - \"registered to a female illegal alien?\" Like, how does that work exactly? An illegal alien shouldn't have documents that would make them eligible to buy, much less register, a car. How'd THAT go down in your district? permalink award report block reply\nthrottlejohnson 1 points 5 days ago tbh, i wouldn't care if they did roll up to the daycare and pull her out kicking and screaming. permalink award report block reply\nPearlyGaits57 1 points 5 days ago Media yet again, embelishes/lies, about the real truth.
