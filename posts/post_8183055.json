Tell me I\u2019m dumb mock me do what the hell you will I\u2019m on the ground and I see what\u2019s happening to our culture and society. White people want nothing to do with physical labor anymore. \u201cOh you don\u2019t pay enough\u201d- bullshit- white kids would rather make eight dollars an hour sitting in a fucking smoke shop not doing Jack shit then make twice that doing something outside in the heat. You have never hired someone in your life. Yeah that\u2019s right motherfuckers you bring those down thumbs!! J6er here. Nothing but cowards, faggots and losers on this website now\u2014 fuck you people you have no fucking clue what\u2019s going on!  Keep your head in the sand! Our culture is broken, and no politician is going to fix it. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 21 points 1 day ago People don\u2019t work hard for themselves. They\u2019ll break their back for their families. Bring back getting married at 20 and see how many kids jump into hard labor. I also reject your premise because a lot of the trades went from a stable long term jobs to sub minimum wage gigs. It\u2019s just hilarious to see this absolute bullshit lines get slung around like it\u2019s true. permalink parent award report block reply ChinaFlu 5 points 20 hours ago Young adults need something to live for, fight for, die for. And that something is families. Without that, people are directionless; rudderless. They need a purpose in life. permalink parent award report block reply bidensmissingbrain -7 points 1 day ago Bring back getting married at 20 and see how many kids jump into hard labor. Virtually zero. They'd divorce/leave and go work in a smoke shop for $8/hr. permalink parent award report block reply CommanderComadant -8 points 22 hours ago Negative- Hispanic kids specifically will work to support their own family. It\u2019s not the same ratio with others. It\u2019s culture \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with your sentiment. I think it\u2019s important that we foster a culture of marriage as well. But to say companies only hire because they want cheap labor is FALSE. There\u2019s a specific level of responsibility I no longer get with white Americans and as a white American I\u2019m disappointed in this as Ive noticed a substantial drastic-significant -change before Covid and after relating to white Americans work ethic. You guys can bitch and call me the big bad Wolf all you want but I see reality more than most of you it seems. permalink parent award report block reply 2scoops2peachmints 8 points 1 day ago This was by design. They forced milliners to take out loans and go to college saying it\u2019s the future and the only way you\u2019ll be successful and get a job. Now the next generation sees through the farce and says fuck it, I\u2019ll just work in the smoke shop and collect gov gibs. When schools started getting rid of metal shop and drivers Ed it should have been a wake up call for boomers but they didn\u2019t give a flying fuck and just want to act superior when it\u2019s their fault we\u2019re in the situation we are now. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 8 points 1 day ago I\u2019m worried about the unemployment rate for those recent college grads due to H1b, AI, and offshoring. The jobs we thought would be available for them are being given to foreigners permalink parent award report block reply covok48 4 points 23 hours ago This. The current employment rate for 2024 grads is 60%. For 2025 grades it\u2019s more like 30%. This is not good. I was full time employed within a month of graduation in 2007. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

Everything should work for the good of the society. Personal efficacy and profit is fine as long as it\u2019s not at odds with the good of society. When you look into it, you will find out this is national socialism and that is literally Hitler. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 18 points 1 day ago Mass deportation is the humane solution. If that is denied to us, the remaining options to retake our country will be far less peaceful\u2026 permalink award report block reply ModernKnight 13 points 1 day ago Far left position: let anyone in Moderate position: deport all illegal immigrants Far right position: we have 50 million illegal immigrants, which can be solved by 50 million pikes on our southern border. permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 8 points 1 day ago The actual solution is not to put the illegal aliens' heads on pikes, but to put the Democrats' heads on pikes. Their willingness to vote for the self-destruction of our country is the real source of our problems. The illegals were just coming here for free money; a deportation is good enough to solve that problem. permalink parent award report block reply noPTSDforMePlease 6 points 24 hours ago It's both.

RockFlagAndEagle2020 13 points 1 day ago It's only a problem because boomers decided it was more important to rub their egos then raise families. They demonized motherhood and replaced motherhood with consumerism. There aren't enough tax payers to fund the benefit system boomers voted in for themselves. I see only one solution here if we want to keep America. End boomer benefits - bye bye Medicare and Social Security, Ban multi-home home ownership, ban companies from buying single family homes and watch the market self correct by 50%. Frankly boomers have served their purpose and they offer little to no benefit to our GDP. They have become a chain weighing down their children's futures. Force them to sell their assets to support their lifestyle. No more hand outs. permalink award report block reply BirthHole 12 points 1 day ago For every mooslim that comes here, take $1,000,000 away from Israel's pot of free money.

They could also encourage all the pandas to enter mixed species breeding with the polar bears by making every commercial, TV show, and movie with a couple a male polar bear and female panda. permalink award report block reply based_trekkie 2 points 1 day ago You bring in polar bears and paint black spots on them. permalink award report block reply Motownmow 2 points 20 hours ago Basic economics dictates: Declining population -> low workforce supply, lower demand for everyday products, lower demand for housing -> rising wages for workers, lower prices for everyday products, lower housing costs -> YOU CAN NOW AFFORD MORE, WORK LESS, AND HAVE MORE CHILDREN It would have been self-correcting, but globohomo has no interest in a slump.

Mass importation is most definitely the solution if your problem is declining Democrat voters and a desire to increase census numbers in blue areas to increase electoral college votes.  Think about it, immigrants are ready-made dependents for generations to come. Democrats/liberals have spent decades telling us that we need to lessen the population, why would we believe they now suddenly care about the problem they've spent decades pretending didn't exist? permalink award report block reply hilboggins 1 points 22 hours ago Well the bullshit is the population doesn't grow because they can't afford to grow...

Rodents are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Pandaland to make.

They demonized motherhood and replaced motherhood with consumerism. There aren't enough tax payers to fund the benefit system boomers voted in for themselves. I see only one solution here if we want to keep America. End boomer benefits - bye bye Medicare and Social Security, Ban multi-home home ownership, ban companies from buying single family homes and watch the market self correct by 50%. Frankly boomers have served their purpose and they offer little to no benefit to our GDP. They have become a chain weighing down their children's futures. Force them to sell their assets to support their lifestyle. No more hand outs. permalink award report block reply\nBirthHole 12 points 1 day ago For every mooslim that comes here, take $1,000,000 away from Israel's pot of free money.
