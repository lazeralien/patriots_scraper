Meanwhile, cutting 100k trees is about putting 6k tons of carbon or more in the air per day. so essentially in a 1 month period flying is 75k or more tons of carbon, but cutting down all those trees is about at least 180k or more tones in the same amount of time. Then figuring out they literally put roads that were not needed so we extend this time towards say 3-4 years. 180 x 12 is 1.96 Million tons of carbon in a year, and say 3-4 years that reaches 5.7 Million- 8.2 Million tons of Carbon. Oh, it gets better when they will still use flights with rarely using that road. They did it because they could, and they have an attitude similar to those ...

That's how the left operates Socialism for them is just lining their own pockets permalink award report block reply GA_Logic 3 points 3 days ago The best way to combat Co2 concentrations being elevated is to sequester it via with more trees as they will convert into O2. So President Trump is calling out their agenda because if they were serious about the climate change phobia they would not cut down trees. The best way to sequester carbon dioxide is with more vegetation.  The earth has a system in place to address this with increasing temps leading to more rain which means more green earth.  That balance is why the earth is self regulating when it comes to the hydrologic cycle and greenhouse gases. permalink award report block reply TheAttackTitan 3 points 3 days ago I always felt environmental conservation should be a tenant of any Republican\u2019s platform. We can\u2019t exactly call ourselves conservative if we don\u2019t conserve our natural resources, environment, and act as good stewards of the wildlife that we\u2019ve been gifted by God. Teddy Roosevelt was the flagship conservationist and OG progressive who shifted public consciousness about our beautiful natural lands. Say what you will about the national parks service but it\u2019s really one of the few federal departments worth a damn. The fact the environmentalists aren\u2019t livid about clearing large swaths of jungle to make a highway for a climate summit just shows how sanctimonious the modern left is when it comes to environmental protection issues. permalink award report block reply MajorClark 2 points 3 days ago Climate scam permalink award report block reply Say_what_again 2 points 3 days ago There was literally no other suitable place anywhere on the entire planet that could be used for a business meeting, bigot. permalink award report block reply brewser724 2 points 3 days ago Get us the fuck out of the UN already. permalink award report block reply Plsdontfireme 2 points 3 days ago WHO CARES WHAT THEY DO IN BRAZIL?!

Meanwhile, cutting 100k trees is about putting 6k tons of carbon or more in the air per day. so essentially in a 1 month period flying is 75k or more tons of carbon, but cutting down all those trees is about at least 180k or more tones in the same amount of time. Then figuring out they literally put roads that were not needed so we extend this time towards say 3-4 years. 180 x 12 is 1.96 Million tons of carbon in a year, and say 3-4 years that reaches 5.7 Million- 8.2 Million tons of Carbon. Oh, it gets better when they will still use flights with rarely using that road. They did it because they could, and they have an attitude similar to those ...

So President Trump is calling out their agenda because if they were serious about the climate change phobia they would not cut down trees. The best way to sequester carbon dioxide is with more vegetation.  The earth has a system in place to address this with increasing temps leading to more rain which means more green earth.  That balance is why the earth is self regulating when it comes to the hydrologic cycle and greenhouse gases. permalink award report block reply\nTheAttackTitan 3 points 3 days ago I always felt environmental conservation should be a tenant of any Republican\u2019s platform. We can\u2019t exactly call ourselves conservative if we don\u2019t conserve our natural resources, environment, and act as good stewards of the wildlife that we\u2019ve been gifted by God. Teddy Roosevelt was the flagship conservationist and OG progressive who shifted public consciousness about our beautiful natural lands. Say what you will about the national parks service but it\u2019s really one of the few federal departments worth a damn. The fact the environmentalists aren\u2019t livid about clearing large swaths of jungle to make a highway for a climate summit just shows how sanctimonious the modern left is when it comes to environmental protection issues. permalink award report block reply\nMajorClark 2 points 3 days ago Climate scam permalink award report block reply\nSay_what_again 2 points 3 days ago There was literally no other suitable place anywhere on the entire planet that could be used for a business meeting, bigot. permalink award report block reply\nbrewser724 2 points 3 days ago Get us the fuck out of the UN already. permalink award report block reply\nPlsdontfireme 2 points 3 days ago WHO CARES WHAT THEY DO IN BRAZIL?!
