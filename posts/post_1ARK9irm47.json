Once I got into pop country (shush, I had to start somewhere and it's catchy) I started comparing the top song lyrics in country vs rap .. and my god there is a huge difference. but wait, there's more. So I went down a rabbit hole of \"maybe it's about income disparity\" and that's why the different tones in the music. Not so fast. There are many majority poor white towns in \"country\" areas, like W.V and KY who don't have violent crimes like they do in the equally poor majority black towns of near the same populations (and I did per capita too to make sure I got solid metrics) So how is it that two groups of people from the same income levels listen to two types of different music with wildly different messages? Is it only the people or is it something else?

In fact, if you want access to certain resources like shooting locations or the use of military assets, you have to play ball with the CIA in that they get to dictate what's allowed and not allowed in your movie as well as parrot whatever message they want you to say in the movie.

Since 'rap music' is absolute shit, and its target audience is too poor to spend money on it, I assumed for forever that it was all some kind of scam and the money was coming from somewhere but not from people buying it. permalink award report block reply Ostia -3 points 2 days ago Lee Greenwood was 100% funded and aided in the rise of his one hit during Desert Storm.

It was all wrapped out together as a military action support sell. Under Mr. Bush CIA Senior no less. That was back when propaganda was used for good though. The good ole\u2019 days. Now it\u2019s just subversion, not persuasion to Americanism.

Once I got into pop country (shush, I had to start somewhere and it's catchy) I started comparing the top song lyrics in country vs rap .. and my god there is a huge difference. but wait, there's more. So I went down a rabbit hole of \"maybe it's about income disparity\" and that's why the different tones in the music. Not so fast. There are many majority poor white towns in \"country\" areas, like W.V and KY who don't have violent crimes like they do in the equally poor majority black towns of near the same populations (and I did per capita too to make sure I got solid metrics) So how is it that two groups of people from the same income levels listen to two types of different music with wildly different messages? Is it only the people or is it something else? God, fishing, beer, friends, family first, checking in on loved ones, loves lost and loves found vs Shooting, violence, drugs, materialism, treating people like shit and a hate of law and order Fucking wild to me permalink award report block reply MuslimsWorshipSatan 4 points 2 days ago Don't neglect the genetic factor either. permalink parent award report block reply\nMuslimsWorshipSatan 4 points 2 days ago Don't neglect the genetic factor either. permalink parent award report block reply\ntholinz 10 points 2 days ago Good, make those Satanists squirm. permalink award report block reply\nThatunknownguy 8 points 2 days ago I've never heard of this guy but I have a feeling hes somehow going to shift the blame off joggers to the CIA permalink award report block reply SwedishChainsaw2 6 points 1 day ago Benz is the one who showed how NGOs were all government funded and how the sensorship machine worked.
