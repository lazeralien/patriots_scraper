They will never accept your apology, they will never accept you. All you do by apologizing to them is alienate your own party. Once you apologize to them, you are now the enemy of your own people, and you are still the enemy of the leftists. In summary: not apologizing = no change, apologizing = things are worse than before. permalink award report block reply VienneseSunrise 5 points 5 days ago They're bullies; whose entire raison d'\u00eatre is to identify weakness in others in order to re-direct from their own crimes/inadequacies. Once they identify weakness, they will summon the mob to rend and tear the victim. The mob will be fed for a time. There are two winnable strategies when faced with this sort of attack (make no mistake -  it is an attack); all out assault (like Trump), or the shield of contempt (like Sydney). permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 1 points 5 days ago Bingo.
