People think back to the Dotcom bubble, but it's not really comparable. There, you had a lot of no-name companies get huge valuations based on thin air and promises. Today, you have a handful of big, well-established companies with monster earnings who also have monster valuations. That's not a bubble. It might be due for a correction, but not anything like the Dotcom bust. Just think: If AI went away tomorrow, would Google and Nvidia, etc. be worthless? Fuck no. Also, AI will imo increase productivity. It already is. It can streamline a lot of monotonous tasks and free up the employee to do more innovative work. The concern is that moronic, greedy companies will think they can fully replace workers with AI, instead of letting their existing employees use it as a force multiplier. With that in mind, given the wave of recent layoffs, it does make sense to be short-term bearish. That doesn't mean they won't keep rising, though. \"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 2 points 5 days ago If AI went away tomorrow, would Google and Nvidia, etc. be worthless?

I work in IT, installing and fixing servers and storage systems in datacenters for banks, insurance, financial companies, etc. and they're not installing a lot of AI hardware. An AI testbed demo here and there, but that's it. I know because I install and configure the damn things across about 50 datacenters in one metro alone. What are they installing if it's not AI?  STORAGE!  MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF STORAGE! And all of it is being managed by off-shored IT \"management\" companies based in India and those guys are fucking morons. And it's been that way for the at least the past 5 years and counting. What they're doing is contracting out anything-AI to the west coast and keeping the data stored in the midwest, south, and NE. If the west coast ever suffers a big power outage that lasts for a while, all that AI shit's going to start falling apart pretty quick. Why?  Because real AI datacenters have to be liquid-cooled and the vast majority of DCs in the USA are still not setup for liquid-cooling - it's all air-cooled.  Some try using dedicated hot-aisle/cold-aisle tricks but they almost always fail, especially when a DC fucks up and puts too many high-pressure, high-BTU server racks on the same aisle and it over-pressures the hot-aisle and starts blowing hot air back through the server racks into the cold-aisle. Many such cases. permalink parent award report block reply SHILL_DETECTOR 2 points 5 days ago there you go again! permalink parent award report block reply HyperCarbs 1 points 5 days ago It already popped. All the bigtech companies did AI layoffs this year. However, cutting-edge computing is still moving forward. Those comapies are still outperforming the market. In fact, they are the market right now. Personally, I'd wait for the next correction to get in if you've been sitting on the sidelines waiting for something to pop. permalink parent award report block reply Hoshi 2 points 5 days ago I bought a lot during the last two tariff scares this year mostly and  still waiting for a major correction for most of my money. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 1 points 5 days ago In fact, they are the market right now. You should be concerned that a handful of companies \"are the market\" OpenAI has been asking for government bailouts since at least last week.

And during this time there's fearmongering speculation about the economic ramifications of the government shutdown and the globalist IMF is raising the alarm about global public debt and emphasizing the US's debt.

We know china is gonna get its chips no matter what, they are investing extreme amounts into AI (they dont mind building entire ghosts cities to prop up their GDP, so at this point AI isn't a problem lol) and only NVDA makes good AI chips, so...

When the stock market crashes, I will give Trump no blame. Sorry, but the stock market is a ponzi scheme for foolish mainstream investors, and smart traders. Have fun making a ton of money over years and then losing it all in a week, having absolutely nothing to show for it. permalink award report block reply _Sully_ 3 points 5 days ago Right, no one ever made any money ever that\u2019s why they keep doing it. Get a grip, man. I\u2019ve made thousands in the stock market and got to use the money. Me a stem schmuck barely making 6 figs. Why is this place so full of doomers and mopers? I\u2019m literally unemployed now and the outlook hasn\u2019t looked better. We were staring down the barrel of a gun a year ago. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 0 points 5 days ago no one ever made any money ever that\u2019s why they keep doing it semantically yes, no one is making money off it because it's only a minority of people who have the resources to play with stocks Go around town and ask people who owns stocks or know what the hell is going on. Stock market doesn't reflect what normal people are going through every day. permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 3 points 5 days ago I don\u2019t need to ask around town cuz it\u2019s me. I\u2019m not some rich person, bro. You are trying to convince me that the stock market never helped normal people. Oh I\u2019m sure there are people who aren\u2019t using it but that\u2019s their mistake. Your argument is ludicrous. Yes, the stock market isn\u2019t the economy and yes people could be doing bad while it\u2019s doing well. However they could be doing well because the stock market is too. Look I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s this wonderful thing but it is absolutely brain dead and quite frankly ignorant to say normal people can\u2019t invest their money. Hell, I bought stocks when I was 20 years old. Threw in a thousand dollars and turned it into $2,500. This is a normal person activity. I\u2019m sorry you aren\u2019t doing well at the moment but your attitude is simply defeatist for no good reason. Invest your money when you can. It\u2019s the smart thing to do. permalink parent award report block reply Mddet OP 2 points 4 days ago \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 permalink parent award report block reply Mddet OP 2 points 5 days ago Ok yer nuts.

People think back to the Dotcom bubble, but it's not really comparable. There, you had a lot of no-name companies get huge valuations based on thin air and promises. Today, you have a handful of big, well-established companies with monster earnings who also have monster valuations. That's not a bubble. It might be due for a correction, but not anything like the Dotcom bust. Just think: If AI went away tomorrow, would Google and Nvidia, etc. be worthless? Fuck no. Also, AI will imo increase productivity. It already is. It can streamline a lot of monotonous tasks and free up the employee to do more innovative work. The concern is that moronic, greedy companies will think they can fully replace workers with AI, instead of letting their existing employees use it as a force multiplier. With that in mind, given the wave of recent layoffs, it does make sense to be short-term bearish.
