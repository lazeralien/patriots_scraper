This is an obvious attempt to negate right wingers who were growing critical of Israel. Boomers would sooner sell this country to foreigners than give up on their Zionism. Which is all very ironic because it\u2019s exactly how Weimar played out and will certainly mean the death of the grand ole party. I absolutely will not vote for losers in \u201826 without some massive wins and apologies. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 7 points 1 hour ago He literally hasn\u2019t permalink parent award report block reply happyfave 6 points 1 hour ago How is he flipped 180 on immigration That is the stupidest take I've heard all day permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 3 points 35 minutes ago MAGA voters are shifting even further right on immigration than Trump ran on, then they are claiming that Trump ran on their current position. Trump never ran on ending all legal immigration. He made a few comments about H1B's but it was never a main issue for his campaign. He was mostly campaigning on deporting illegals, which he is doing. permalink parent award report block reply MakeCaliforniaRED 2 points 29 minutes ago I still want more deportations, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to what Xiden Autopen let in for 4 years. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

They may be happening, but not to the extent that will actually tangibly improve the country. permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 1 points 33 minutes ago People don't want to admit that deporting all illegal aliens, while maintaining civil rights and the 4th amendment, is going to take a very long time. You can't just arrest every brown person you see, the way that Eisenhower did. There are tens of millions of Hispanics that are US citizens today. That was not the case back in the days of Operation Wetback. The best thing we can do is push Trump to arrest CEO's for hiring illegals. If that happens, the jobs for illegals will dry up, and self-deportations will skyrocket. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 6 points 1 hour ago What fucking retard stickied a psyop permalink award report block reply YouEssAye 0 points 51 minutes ago Do you ever stop to think if you're the one that's fallen for a psyop and not everyone else? permalink parent award report block reply chefjeffb 2 points 48 minutes ago No, it's you faggots clamoring away about Trump turning his back to immigration efforts permalink parent award report block reply YouEssAye 0 points 41 minutes ago Where are the mass deportations we were promised? permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut -1 points 30 minutes ago Show proof of that promise, assaye permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

Best youve got? permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Throwingway22 5 points 57 minutes ago A 50-year mortgage + reducing the use of credit scores in applicants would only expand the demand for houses without touching the supply. It would be another program to give inner-city joggers the ability to move next door in the suburb people moved to to get away from the crime and decay. Just absolute South Africanization of America. permalink award report block reply FatigueIsReal 2 points 52 minutes ago Reducing the use of credit scores has been suggested? permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut 1 points 28 minutes ago In propagandaland, yes permalink parent award report block reply Refugee1000 1 points 54 minutes ago 100%, talk about DEI. What we need is to de regulate building. If someone wants to build a log cabin with nothing but a toilet in the corner fucking let them. Why is a 100 year old house legal to live in but a new one isn't unless you make an 3 foot wide door because someone who buys the house from you might be a gimp.

Geeze this is getting bad. permalink award report block reply Flowers-By-Irene 1 points 2 hours ago Can sub for democrats if we run out of illegals. permalink award report block reply VanDeKoik 1 points 31 minutes ago Ok? Dont get one? And if you want 50 million deportations there are openings at ICE right now. permalink award report block reply bemac 1 points 30 minutes ago AI shit permalink award report block reply Goatboy66 1 points 1 hour ago 50 million Deportations will definitely bring down the Cost of Housing. permalink award report block reply VanDeKoik 1 points 28 minutes ago No it won't. permalink parent award report block reply DeltaSierra 1 points 1 hour ago The best is still - Black Sabbath Matters permalink award report block reply try4gain PRO 0 points 1 hour ago ALWAYS BE CHIMPING permalink award report block reply donteatthat 0 points 2 hours ago Well that's just too bad permalink award report block reply Repentnow -2 points 1 hour ago Both is the correct answer. The 50 year mortgage hate is retarded. It just adds an additional option. You can still get what ever length mortgage you want. If you take a 50 year mortgage and make the same payment as a 15 year mortgage, you'll be paid off in 15 years with the exact same interest paid. The advantage of the 50yr is your minimum payment is much lower compared to a 15yr, so if you hit a financial snag anywhere during that 15 years, you could drop back to the lower minimum payment for a little while. permalink award report block reply Parhelion12 3 points 1 hour ago Oh cmon. That's just intellectually dishonest. Combing 50 year mtgs with the widespread financial illiteracy is an AUTOMATIC wealth transfer. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 47 minutes ago So when the 30 year mortgages were created, a wealth transfer happened? Japan and Switzerland offer 50 year mortgages.  Sweden has no limit and the average is 140 years. Japan has previously offered generational 100 year mortgages. Let me know how they're doing compared to the US. Hint: the problem might be darker and have nothing to do with the mortgage term length. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 52 minutes ago If some people are too stupid to understand how mortgage and interest work, then they deserve whatever financial disaster befalls them. People are 100%  responsible for their own selves. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut -1 points 55 minutes ago Tell me youre a democrat without telling me. Your favorite show is the young turks. Say donor class. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 2 points 1 hour ago Agreed. Dave Ramsey has said if you can't obtain a 15 year mortgage go with a 30 and just pay it off in 15 years. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 46 minutes ago I know many that have used this. The going strategy was to base it on interest.  High interest, get the higher year mortgage and when interest drops, refi for the 10 or 15 year mortgage. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 1 points 40 minutes ago This was very common in the 80s with interest sky high. permalink parent award report block reply berserkerbarrage -5 points 2 hours ago Then  don't take out a 50 year mortgage. They also said that they were working on making 5 and 15 year mortgages more available. Nobody is forcing you to do anything you don't want to, but other people will appreciate the options. We're deporting people as fast as legally possible and at much higher rates than previous administrations (turnaways =/= deportations). If it's not fast enough then maybe you should focus more on electing MAGA candidates to change the law and less on trying to help open borders Democrats win. For the anti-Trump trolls that will inevitably bot the shit out of this thread. permalink award report block reply Mamapedia 4 points 2 hours ago Every person who has legitimate criticisms of Trump's words and actions is not an anti-Trump troll. Blind adulation is for fools.  Thank you for the facts you outlined, but the last sentence conflates valid criticism and trolling. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut -2 points 56 minutes ago You dont have legitimate criticisms, you just claim you do while sperging over and over like a petulant child. permalink parent award report block reply Mamapedia 2 points 56 minutes ago Oh Jesus, go with that if it makes you feel better. You may find that your blinders serve the left very well in the not so distant future. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut 0 points 38 minutes ago Complaining about an option you dont have to take while hes trying to do nearly everything else he ran on is not legitimate criticism, sorry if you dont like that. The only, and I mean only, legitimate criticism ive seen of him lately is that the ingrham interview could have been alot better, and he doesnt seem to be dooming like everyone else so hes trying to focus on things hes doing right now. Is he a little out of touch in it, yeah, but if everyone is going to go full chicken little over an interview that wasnt great, MAGA deserves to lose far more than just the midterms. The democrats were loyal to biden for 4 years no matter what he did and he was a literal potato. MAGA is just fickle people who want magic wands to fix everything immediately apparently because the media plays into your attitudes, knowing you'll end up self destructing just like the democrats are doing. Only they'll be able to pull together in elections, because they are at least unified in their hatred of you. So dont forget to adjust your own blinders while acting smug. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... berserkerbarrage -3 points 2 hours ago Where is the legitimate criticism? It's also just a fact that this site is being botted and brigaded by Nick Fuentes trolls. If you can't explain why offering people more mortgage options (on both ends of the spectrum) is a bad thing then it's not a legitimate criticism. If you're blaming Trump for the fact that more people aren't being deported (despite him deporting people as fast as legally possible), that's not legitimate criticism. If you're blaming Trump for high beef prices but you can't say how or why he's responsible for high beef prices, that's not a legitimate criticism. permalink parent award report block reply Mamapedia 1 points 1 hour ago Both exist.  You only appear willing to acknowledge the trolling.  Am I to understand that one must be 100% pro Israel and pro-corporate to be MAGA?  There are pressing domestic issues that should come first, and Trump seems to be otherwise engaged at this point, given what he has said about h1b's and his international focus.  I have to say that the ballroom business and the corporate love fest is awful for optics and the morale of those who are looking to Trump for economic relief, and I'm not talking about welfare recipients, but working people who keep falling farther behind despite their efforts.  If you don't see that and acknowledge the threat that it is, you must live in pretty rarified circumstances.  A people with a bleak future are very easy prey. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 2 points 43 minutes ago The fuck does Israel have to do with this conversation? permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... berserkerbarrage 0 points 1 hour ago Nope, I am anti-Israel and anti-Jew, and you still haven't provided any legitimate criticisms. The ballroom? LOL. If we divided up the cost of the ballroom (which isn't being paid for by the tax payers) between everybody in America, you'd have less than $1.

You are either a cultist or a shill and you can fuck yourself with a claw hammer. permalink parent award report block reply berserkerbarrage -3 points 1 hour ago Yes, it is fake news. H1B workers are less than 3% of the tech industry, and a fraction of a percentage of the overall work force. And we've always accepted foreign students, which account for roughly 5% of students. It's not something new and if anything, Trump has significantly cracked down on the abuse of such programs. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

I've been a hardcore Trump fan since the escalator. I've been harassed many times for wearing my MAGA hat in public. I've donated money despite being on a tight budget. I've been to 3 rallies.

The 50 year mortgage hate is retarded. It just adds an additional option. You can still get what ever length mortgage you want. If you take a 50 year mortgage and make the same payment as a 15 year mortgage, you'll be paid off in 15 years with the exact same interest paid. The advantage of the 50yr is your minimum payment is much lower compared to a 15yr, so if you hit a financial snag anywhere during that 15 years, you could drop back to the lower minimum payment for a little while. permalink award report block reply Parhelion12 3 points 1 hour ago Oh cmon.

Dave Ramsey has said if you can't obtain a 15 year mortgage go with a 30 and just pay it off in 15 years. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 46 minutes ago I know many that have used this. The going strategy was to base it on interest.  High interest, get the higher year mortgage and when interest drops, refi for the 10 or 15 year mortgage. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 1 points 40 minutes ago This was very common in the 80s with interest sky high. permalink parent award report block reply\nFatigueIsReal 3 points 46 minutes ago I know many that have used this.

They also said that they were working on making 5 and 15 year mortgages more available. Nobody is forcing you to do anything you don't want to, but other people will appreciate the options. We're deporting people as fast as legally possible and at much higher rates than previous administrations (turnaways =/= deportations). If it's not fast enough then maybe you should focus more on electing MAGA candidates to change the law and less on trying to help open borders Democrats win. For the anti-Trump trolls that will inevitably bot the shit out of this thread. permalink award report block reply Mamapedia 4 points 2 hours ago Every person who has legitimate criticisms of Trump's words and actions is not an anti-Trump troll.

The only, and I mean only, legitimate criticism ive seen of him lately is that the ingrham interview could have been alot better, and he doesnt seem to be dooming like everyone else so hes trying to focus on things hes doing right now. Is he a little out of touch in it, yeah, but if everyone is going to go full chicken little over an interview that wasnt great, MAGA deserves to lose far more than just the midterms. The democrats were loyal to biden for 4 years no matter what he did and he was a literal potato. MAGA is just fickle people who want magic wands to fix everything immediately apparently because the media plays into your attitudes, knowing you'll end up self destructing just like the democrats are doing. Only they'll be able to pull together in elections, because they are at least unified in their hatred of you.

I have to say that the ballroom business and the corporate love fest is awful for optics and the morale of those who are looking to Trump for economic relief, and I'm not talking about welfare recipients, but working people who keep falling farther behind despite their efforts.

H1B workers are less than 3% of the tech industry, and a fraction of a percentage of the overall work force. And we've always accepted foreign students, which account for roughly 5% of students.
