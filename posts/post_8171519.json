The state department determines what will be on the passport not a retarded troon. permalink award report block reply BlackPilledMAGA 33 points 6 days ago Actually biology determines it, not some fucking troom's wish. permalink parent award report block reply The_Return_of_User_x 11 points 6 days ago I hope he/she passports get invalidated while abroad. permalink parent award report block reply Choppermagic 2 points 6 days ago send them to the middle east permalink parent award report block reply Valiazaner 26 points 6 days ago I mean it's not even that. A Passport is a document owned by the US government entrusted to a citizen. That document is asking a foreign government to allow that citizen entry and to afford them all the rights and privileges an American citizen can expect to enjoy while in that nation. If you are trying to enter a nation such as Saudi Arabia that has none of that non sense then an X or a \"they/them\" on a passport will not only devalue the passport but also potentially put the holder in danger. A passport is a document that is supposed to grant entry to other nations. Weird gender shit weakens the US passport. permalink parent award report block reply NotYourMan 2 points 6 days ago Well that isn't a surprise.  One of the goals of a passport is to identify somebody and they can't be identified by their latest crazy idea of who they are.  But they can be identified by the biological sex.  That works great. permalink parent award report block reply Just_a_Patriot 56 points 6 days ago No one has to pay along with these people's unchecked imaginations. permalink award report block reply Johnkimble111 2 points 6 days ago I think the genuinely intersex people might have had a case here legally but there\u2019s barely any of those around. Pretty retarded to have trannies bring this case. They always use intersex people as proof of things not being binary and it would be assured to recognise people just basically pretending to be intersex or the opposite sex. permalink parent award report block reply xanax123 3 points 6 days ago Drop the intersex nonsense. Besides the fact it is so insanely rare, a doctor determines their sex at birth so that\u2019s what they are classified as. Continuing to mention them just muddles up the argument and makes it seem like a bigger issue than it is. permalink parent award report block reply BoberFett 2 points 6 days ago The existence of intersex mutations is just the excuse that predators use to gain access to women. Intersex is rare, and they generally don't want to call attention to their condition. It's the predators that announce their presence at every opportunity and threaten women who don't bow in obedience. That's almost all troons. permalink parent award report block reply fazaman 1 points 5 days ago Intersex people are still male or female. They just have abnormalities making it less clear. permalink parent award report block reply Bldg_2019 45 points 6 days ago Cool. Now invalidate the active ones that already have them. Catch some of those faggots overseas as they try to come back and before the holidays. permalink award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 22 points 6 days ago That's what happens. Their passport gets invalidated and they have to go in and fix it. permalink parent award report block reply Bldg_2019 15 points 6 days ago I misspoke. What I meant to say is invalidate the ones that already have them AND add the individuals to the no fly list. They need to come here like the Cubans do. Or maybe in a shipping container. My apologies to all for not being clear. permalink parent award report block reply PoohBearBalloon 7 points 6 days ago Kek! permalink parent award report block reply possibletower 1 points 6 days ago They do in fact invalidate old passports and give correct gender passports now.

How about that. permalink award report block reply drattastic1 7 points 6 days ago This is all pretty minor compared to what I fear the SCOTUS is about to do to Trump's tariffs which will pretty much destroy our foreign policy leverage. Then I'm sure they're also going to rule in favor of allowing anchor babies to continue the scam to finish off this country. Ruling for Trump on this minor stuff is window dressing. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower 3 points 6 days ago The problem is Trump is using the type of tariffs that don't have precedents to cover his ass. Some of them like the metals tariffs do have precedents. He declared a state of emergency/state of war for some of his tariffs for example and some retard from the Heritage Foundation told him it is 100% SCOTUS-proof. Heritage fags are fucking retarded. Whomever advised him to use that method was a fucking retard. Trump and his people didn't do their due diligence and they only have themselves to blame if SCOTUS rules against him. Don't be surprised if even Alito and Thomas vote against him. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 2 points 6 days ago If SCOTUS screws Trump on tariffs, I'm preparing for a long and tumultuous next few decades. That's been the only thing going for him, outside of a few other economic factors. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard -2 points 6 days ago Money the root of all evil.
