He will be sentenced in February and faces up to 30 years in prison. He posted this deranged video running away from police claiming they won\u2019t catch him. This didn\u2019t age well! https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1986822538496733600 New Hampshire transgender Rep Stacie Laughton just pleaded guilty to child exploitation charges. He will be sentenced in February and faces up to 30 years in prison. He posted this deranged video running away from police claiming they won\u2019t catch him. This didn\u2019t age well! He was first elected to the Nashua Board of Selectmen in 2012, becoming the first transgender elected official in New Hampshire. Criminal History and Resignations : In 2012, Laughton resigned from the New Hampshire House of Representatives after it was revealed he had a felony conviction and had not completed his sentence, making him ineligible to hold office. He was later arrested in 2015 for making a bomb threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, receiving a six-month jail sentence. In 2021, he was arrested for sending false emergency texts to the Nashua 911 system. 2022 Stalking Charges : Laughton was arrested in November 2022 for violating a restraining order against a woman, leading to his resignation from the state legislature just days after re-election. The incident involved repeated attempts to contact the victim despite the court order. 2023 Child Pornography Charges : On June 23, 2023, Laughton was arrested on charges of distributing sexually explicit images of children.\nThe investigation began after a report of a juvenile incident, leading to a search of his residence and his subsequent arrest.\nHe was also charged with aiding and abetting in the sexual exploitation of children. As of July 2023, he was held in preventive detention and scheduled for arraignment. permalink parent award report block reply SaltyTitties4 11 points 5 days ago If this doesn\u2019t show yall that ALL elections are fixed, I don\u2019t know what will. permalink parent award report block reply Sgt_Hulka 8 points 5 days ago Fuck every democrat and New Hampshire moron who votes blue no matter who.

Does the wickedness of a person create the unpleasant physiognomy or does the unpleasant physiognomy assist in creating the wickedness? Wicked thoughts morph the face into ugliness Or an ugly face morphs the thoughts into wickedness permalink parent award report block reply Lol_Garrus 8 points 5 days ago I believe its the wickedness. When you void your soul of the Holy Spirit, you don't have the Holy Spirit's lifeforce within you. Thus, your body ages and degenerates much faster, you lose interest in taking care of your body, no self-respect, etc. I have the Holy Spirit within my body and soul, and He limit-breaks my immune system, allowing it to go Super Saiyan. permalink parent award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 6 points 5 days ago I agree.

AmarilloArmadillo 4 points 5 days ago I think the second point has merit, but I'd word it differently. I don't think being ugly makes them evil, but being a certain kind of ugly may be associated with a certain predisposition to evil. I think evil changes the outward to match the inward (eventually anyway) too, so it might be a distinction without a difference. I don't trust people that look like this, and they'll never be near my kids even if they aren't evil. I also just generally don't trust my kids to anyone but immediate family. permalink parent award report block reply Decepticons-superior 2 points 5 days ago This is like when Palpatine became deformed while fighting Mace Windu.

The actor who played the role, Ian McDiarmid, seems to agree with your first option: The uglier form of Palpatine was \"what he always looked like\" due to his evilness; the kind, non-disfigured-looking form was a disguise that was no longer needed upon his ascension to the throne. permalink parent award report block reply Yignuced 10 points 5 days ago Shocked permalink award report block reply tt777 2 points 5 days ago Not shocked. permalink parent award report block reply toofdood1993 9 points 5 days ago woman? that's a fucking dude, call it what it is, not what it wants to be this is why you don't let these faggots around your children.

High T men can block out the noise and live their own lives, but weak white men cannot live their lives through the shame and insults, and so they turn to transgenderism as a way to virtue signal. permalink award report block reply anotherrandomname 1 points 5 days ago They're degenerate fetishists.

He was first elected to the Nashua Board of Selectmen in 2012, becoming the first transgender elected official in New Hampshire. Criminal History and Resignations : In 2012, Laughton resigned from the New Hampshire House of Representatives after it was revealed he had a felony conviction and had not completed his sentence, making him ineligible to hold office. He was later arrested in 2015 for making a bomb threat to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, receiving a six-month jail sentence. In 2021, he was arrested for sending false emergency texts to the Nashua 911 system. 2022 Stalking Charges : Laughton was arrested in November 2022 for violating a restraining order against a woman, leading to his resignation from the state legislature just days after re-election. The incident involved repeated attempts to contact the victim despite the court order. 2023 Child Pornography Charges : On June 23, 2023, Laughton was arrested on charges of distributing sexually explicit images of children.\nThe investigation began after a report of a juvenile incident, leading to a search of his residence and his subsequent arrest.\nHe was also charged with aiding and abetting in the sexual exploitation of children. As of July 2023, he was held in preventive detention and scheduled for arraignment. permalink parent award report block reply SaltyTitties4 11 points 5 days ago If this doesn\u2019t show yall that ALL elections are fixed, I don\u2019t know what will. permalink parent award report block reply Sgt_Hulka 8 points 5 days ago Fuck every democrat and New Hampshire moron who votes blue no matter who.

I don't think being ugly makes them evil, but being a certain kind of ugly may be associated with a certain predisposition to evil. I think evil changes the outward to match the inward (eventually anyway) too, so it might be a distinction without a difference. I don't trust people that look like this, and they'll never be near my kids even if they aren't evil. I also just generally don't trust my kids to anyone but immediate family. permalink parent award report block reply\nDecepticons-superior 2 points 5 days ago This is like when Palpatine became deformed while fighting Mace Windu. I always wondered if he was hiding his true face or if the evil of what he was doing in that moment mutated him. permalink parent award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 3 points 5 days ago Like with his refusal in naming Yoda's alien species, George Lucas will probably never provide clarification on Palpatine's transformation. The actor who played the role, Ian McDiarmid, seems to agree with your first option: The uglier form of Palpatine was \"what he always looked like\" due to his evilness; the kind, non-disfigured-looking form was a disguise that was no longer needed upon his ascension to the throne. permalink parent award report block reply\nRememberCharlieKirk 3 points 5 days ago Like with his refusal in naming Yoda's alien species, George Lucas will probably never provide clarification on Palpatine's transformation.

A lot of it starts with how the left demonizes white men as the root of all evil (heaven forbid you\u2019re straight, Christian, etc.). High T men can block out the noise and live their own lives, but weak white men cannot live their lives through the shame and insults, and so they turn to transgenderism as a way to virtue signal. permalink award report block reply anotherrandomname 1 points 5 days ago They're degenerate fetishists.
