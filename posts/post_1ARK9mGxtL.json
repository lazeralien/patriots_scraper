We are talking about the most advanced fighter jets in the world. Large corporations hiring these H1B's are ALWAYS taking a job from an American.  Every single time.  There is NEVER a case where an American isn't smart enough to do a job within a short training period.  These companies COULD train their workers but prefer to pay foreigners less. permalink award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 11 points 7 hours ago Look at people around Trump who have his ear.  It\u2019s a lot of guys who benefit from illegals or H#Bs. No one wants to hire Americans, they do want your money though.  Society without God, consumes itself in greed. permalink parent award report block reply Train_w_no_brakes 6 points 7 hours ago It\u2019s also indentured servitude. The attrition is next to nothing for H1-Bs because they get deported if they don\u2019t work. permalink parent award report block reply 45fan 4 points 6 hours ago Bingo. Employers want to have their cake and eat it to. They would train, but then you could move to another position at a competitor if your employer treats you poorly. Not so with H1B. It's effectively modern indentured servitude where the worker is wedded to the business. permalink parent award report block reply someguy7738 1 points 3 hours ago A good chunk of the time the Americans being replaced are forced to train their replacements. This whole thing is bullshit. permalink parent award report block reply MAG-n-KAG 24 points 8 hours ago Trump brokered the peace deal between India and Pakistan.  Then the next week announced we're taking in hundreds of thousands of H1B street shitters.  Coincidence? Thats the thing about all these peace deals he's brokering.  Peace is nice and all, but how's he getting all these countries to agree?  What is he offering?  Nothing comes free.  It seems like he's offering pieces of our ass to get all these deals done.  We the people, our country, our way of life, are the cards in his hands, and he's playing them, whether we consent or not. permalink award report block reply sun_wolf -6 points 7 hours ago I think there is more going on here and that it\u2019s stupid the way people always want to jump to \u201cTrump betrayed us\u201d and \u201cTrump hates America\u201d. It\u2019s like every time he\u2019s proven himself, it\u2019s never enough. For example, if foreign nations like China or India are sending spies into these programs, could the military or CIA have some way of flipping them into double agents? If anything like that was going on, it would defeat the purpose for a President to explain it publicly. permalink parent award report block reply BarrensChat 5 points 6 hours ago 2 more weeks, patriots are in control! permalink parent award report block reply TheDevilMonkey 1 points 3 hours ago You are a fucking mongoloid. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpPl4yedU 2 points 7 hours ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply PatriotSkorzeny 21 points 7 hours ago I guess the midterms are written off. No third term. Dem 2028. It\u2019s a shame. permalink award report block reply current_horror 13 points 6 hours ago It\u2019s a cycle. Populist conservatives rise up, maybe win an election, and then the establishment neocons take the party back and run it into the ground. Then a leftist wins, the country sinks further into gay race communism, and the great replacement accelerates. We fall for the same shit every time. permalink parent award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 3 points 6 hours ago Somehow throughout all that crap, corporations and stock markets grow, because all these destructive policies are made to benefit them. permalink parent award report block reply Tellmeboutit2 17 points 12 hours ago 70% of postdocs aren't American. permalink award report block reply sleepinggiant 11 points 6 hours ago Dont forget this is his second attempt at this shit. He tried this bait and switch right after the election. permalink award report block reply dems_be_crazy 10 points 6 hours ago Easy way to kill H1B program without limitations or fines. For every H1B position a company hires, there must be an American citizen hired and trained for that position. Call their bluff. If the issue is that America doesn't have people qualified for the position, force them to use the \"qualified\" H1B labor to train them. Everybody gets what they want. Nobody can complain they don't have access to the labor they need. If it is truly a unique position that they cannot find local labor for, then give them the quick option and force them to bring that knowledge home. permalink award report block reply Nibba2 1 points 26 minutes ago The government allegedly already has this. My company doesn\u2019t hire H1-B for my field. Not because they wouldn\u2019t in a heartbeat, but because the government will not allow them to sponsor people from out of country. permalink parent award report block reply dems_be_crazy 1 points 8 minutes ago They do not have that. There's various reasons why a company cannot sponsor H-1B: job doesn't qualify, not a valid \"H-1B employer\", labor compliance issues and there is a cap. For those that can hire H-1B, there's no requirement to train. There is a requirement to show they can't fill the position with citizens. For this, they simply post the job to obscure websites with vague terms so nobody can find the position. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 5 points 5 hours ago Replacement immigration is NON NEGOTIABLE. You can't vote on this issue. permalink award report block reply Train_w_no_brakes 4 points 7 hours ago No one seems to give a shit about very good paying jobs getting stolen by foreigners under this programs. Everyone cry\u2019s about illegal aliens stealing low paying jobs from Americans who, in many cases, are net negative tax payers even if the had said job. These foreigners are stealing low to high 6 figure jobs from Americans and Brokies, blinded by envy, don\u2019t give a shit because they make half that. Sorry to break it to you, middle class pays the taxes, not you brokie dipshits. permalink award report block reply Nibba2 1 points 23 minutes ago You must not be a strong reader if you actually think this about H1-B. permalink parent award report block reply GoBigly 4 points 8 hours ago Trump has been corrupted since January 6th 2021. They found enough on him to own him and his family. Hence why his family have been awfully quiet this administration. Their plan is to split the base enough for the Dems to regain the house and senate next year.

The total ignorance and lack of perspective displayed is why most politicians don't care what you think, and why should they since you can be manipulated in a single news cycle. Trump put a $100,000 fee for new H1B applications after Sept 21, 2025. No other politician would have done that, but go ahead and be ungrateful and ignorant. permalink award report block reply FaustyArchaeus 16 points 12 hours ago So a bad policy that might be better than the alternative. Fuck that permalink parent award report block reply dunkeaters 1 points 11 hours ago How is a $100,000 fee for the application a bad policy? permalink parent award report block reply SmallestShil 11 points 9 hours ago It means something wholly unwanted is now legal for a price. How much is America worth to you ? Would you sell it to India if they paid you enough? permalink parent award report block reply dunkeaters 1 points 10 minutes ago That's just naive. It's not \"selling America\", it's making hiring foreigners expensive so that companies don't do it just to undercut American wages. permalink parent award report block reply It_takes_10_years 5 points 7 hours ago Because that's a 1 time fee. Not recurring. So If I hire an Indian for 3 years at 86k instead of paying an American 120k it pays for itself. permalink parent award report block reply dunkeaters 1 points 10 minutes ago Ok, so it's a good policy, but you want more of it. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I think it\u2019s something that Trump needs to take more credit for; right now there are disaffected young people who feel that they are being passed over for jobs in favor of foreigners, and that\u2019s causing them to do insane things like voting for communists. Team Trump needs to stomp on the leftist lies these people are being fed with the truth of what is being done to put Americans first. permalink parent award report block reply dunkeaters 3 points 11 hours ago Same. It completely removes the incentive for companies to undercut American workers, and is only viable when the person is talented enough to justify the expense. Meanwhile we've had over 2 million jobs added for American born workers this year. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 2 points 5 hours ago It would completely remove the incentive if it were payable on every visa renewal. As a one-time fee, it can be paid for by hiring a jeet for $33k/year less than an American (which is fine, since undercutting American  workers is the whole entire point of the program). permalink parent award report block reply jcd_007 2 points 4 hours ago Yes, it absolutely needs to apply to renewals. permalink parent award report block reply dunkeaters 1 points 7 minutes ago Then acknowledge the progress and lobby for more. Instead we get braindead takes that Trump's \"as bad as it gets\" on H1B visas. The point of the program is that it makes American companies more competitive to be able to hire anyone. Tech companies are not like manufacturing, you can't tariff their imports and we would lose jobs if we forced companies to limit their workforce. It's a balance between staying attractive as the tech leader of the world and protecting American workers. Look at Canada's inability to hold onto their tech companies if you don't believe me. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -11 points 12 hours ago Fuck Gen Z. They are the most libshit generation in history and they aren't \"turning on Trump\" because they never voted for Trump. Also Gen Z wants Trump to do socialist price controls on housing and food and healthcare. Fuck Gen Z.

We are talking about the most advanced fighter jets in the world. Large corporations hiring these H1B's are ALWAYS taking a job from an American.  Every single time.  There is NEVER a case where an American isn't smart enough to do a job within a short training period.  These companies COULD train their workers but prefer to pay foreigners less. permalink award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 11 points 7 hours ago Look at people around Trump who have his ear.

For every H1B position a company hires, there must be an American citizen hired and trained for that position. Call their bluff. If the issue is that America doesn't have people qualified for the position, force them to use the \"qualified\" H1B labor to train them. Everybody gets what they want. Nobody can complain they don't have access to the labor they need. If it is truly a unique position that they cannot find local labor for, then give them the quick option and force them to bring that knowledge home. permalink award report block reply Nibba2 1 points 26 minutes ago The government allegedly already has this.

There's various reasons why a company cannot sponsor H-1B: job doesn't qualify, not a valid \"H-1B employer\", labor compliance issues and there is a cap. For those that can hire H-1B, there's no requirement to train. There is a requirement to show they can't fill the position with citizens. For this, they simply post the job to obscure websites with vague terms so nobody can find the position. permalink parent award report block reply\nNibba2 1 points 26 minutes ago The government allegedly already has this.
