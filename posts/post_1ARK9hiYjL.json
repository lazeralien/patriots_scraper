Why did it take Steve Baker, a citizen journolist to get to the bottom of this? Dan??? Kash???

I was on the fence about it until the part about FBI released a video that was edited to make the suspect harder to identify.  The only reason to do that is because the FBI doesn't want the suspect caught since they know the suspect is one of them but knew they had to play along with the investigation for optics.    It's like why they had an \"interview\" with Ray Epps.  They know who he is, why he was there on J6 but had to pretend they were taken accusations seriously. permalink award report block reply bananaguard62 1 points 2 days ago Hate to break it to you,  but Epps was not a Fed. There were feds, Epps wasn't one of them. The evidence against him, including the Big Bang Breach Team theory, fizzled. People think he's guilty simply because they want to at this point. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 2 days ago I'm pretty sure he wasn't a careerist in the FBI if that's what you're saying or any other law enforcement.  However, yes, I do think he was working with them as a CHI. permalink parent award report block reply bananaguard62 2 points 2 days ago Well, he wasn't that either. He was just a dude,  saying the same thing that was said all over this site and in DC leading up to the 6th. Protest a stolen election by storming the capital... peacefully. I was next to him on the 5th and 6th, talked with him, and after being arrested used access to discovery to investigate him, hoping to argue entrapment. It was very clear that he is just a dude. Is say to research it, because most of what I saw is public now,  but it's not really worth the effort at this point.

Dan/Kash, don't investigate it go arrest her, she obviously did it. Leap now, no need to win a court case or anything..  I get it, I want her arrested if she did it, but let's at least make sure it's accurate and that we can use her to flip on the real criminals. permalink award report block reply corporateshizer 2 points 2 days ago The Feds have had 5 years to arrest one of their own capital-city comrades.
