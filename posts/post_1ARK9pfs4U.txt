24 Marx was wrong about many things.  But he was right to oppose Malthus' view-- that famine, disease, war, abortion, & incels-- are "positive checks" against humanity.  Today's celeb "marxists" like Greta, Hasan Piker, Destiny-- are really Malthusian Death Cheerleaders. They hate humans, esp. whites.
