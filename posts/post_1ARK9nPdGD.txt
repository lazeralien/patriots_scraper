10 Hunting on Eastern Shore of MD? posted 5 hours ago by merica 3 comments award share report block Hey gents -- I moved to  Annapolis MD area and want to see if I can go hunting on the eastern shore.  I'm very experienced with upland out west and deer hunting, as far as ducks and geese more intermediate.  It's super expensive to go through a farmer to do geese, I tried it once and was like shooting fish in a barrel.  Limited out in 30 minutes and then had to pay like $400+.  Not really worth it or all that fun.  None of my buddies really hunt though they are interested.  I have 2 gun dogs, 1 mostly retired and 1 puppy who I'm getting trained up now.  Anyone got a group 1-2 of us can join or any other advice?  Frankly I'd love to hear from someone who's figured out upland in the area or would be willing to show me the ropes for geese and ducks.
