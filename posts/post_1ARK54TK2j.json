I say deport them all, they both want Sharia law for this country and hate all Christians. Sharia Law in the US: The implementation of Sharia law as a legal system in the U.S. has been a topic in political discourse, primarily driven by concerns from some conservative pundits and politicians. However, these concerns focus on the perceived threat of its adoption rather than any actual widespread movement to replace U.S. law with Sharia. The U.S. legal system is based on the U.S. Constitution, which establishes a secular government and the separation of church and state, making the implementation of a religious legal system like Sharia unfeasible and unconstitutional. this IS why they want our constitution GONE permalink parent award report block reply SorosHasBallsackEyes 1 points 5 days ago The only way to find out may be via post-mortems permalink parent award report block reply Psarg 0 points 5 days ago Somalia has clans, which are groupings based on ancestry, not tribes, which are based on territory. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 38 points 5 days ago Import the third world, become the third world. permalink award report block reply Bullet_Tooth_Tony 8 points 5 days ago Americans have clans on SOCOM and Call of Duty.

The Afghans, pretty much all men, were so bad the Syrians had to keep their women, in particular, away from them and their children. These men would otherwise straight up target the Syrians and pretty much anyone in the camps. There is a YouTuber called Lubna, who is a Pakistani-Brit and she has literally spoken to a Pakistani woman living in one of these refugee camps in Germany, filled to the brim with Afghan and Pakistani men and they're all moaning about when they get to participate in their jihad and begin their wars.

The clash was the latest in a string of incidents at such events in Germany and elsewhere, with fights breaking out between Eritrean government supporters and opponents.

I genuinely do see Civil Wars within 5 to 6 yrs and I said, Civil Wars, not Civil War because it's going to be Balkanized wars happening between multiple different communities pitching themselves against each other. A different kind of horror is then having multiple countries across the planet try and either fund their community's side or worse, send in troops to allow their side to win or bring back the balance and keep the truce. Whatever happens, it's not going to go well for the US or the world in the next coming decade. permalink award report block reply NewBurner04 3 points 5 days ago Nig no like Nog! permalink award report block reply KeepingAmericaGreat 3 points 5 days ago Oh, brother! permalink award report block reply Weneverleft 3 points 5 days ago X, Balkanization is the process by which a country or region breaks apart into smaller, often unfriendly political units, typically along ethnic, cultural, or religious lines. The term originated from the fragmentation of the Balkan Peninsula in the early 20th century following the breakup of empires like the Ottoman Empire. This fragmentation can result in ethnic conflict and political instability within the newly divided areas. permalink award report block reply Weneverleft 2 points 5 days ago All by design,  Destroy America from within.

The Somalians control Minnesota district 5 because that's where they all are. And by controlling that one district, now the entire state is blue. Seriously, look at the electoral maps. The rest of Minnesota is either red or leans red. But district 5 is big enough (it's the core of the twin cities) to move the entire state solidly blue. thats why there is so much fraud and it's tolerated: Somalians give Minnesota to the Democrats. Without them, Minnesota goes Republican. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 3 points 5 days ago Good to know there is at least ONE functional division on the left that can result in electoral losses.

African tribal warfare in the streets? permalink award report block reply\nMakingArrowsOrange 4 points 5 days ago No Daarood sandstorm. permalink award report block reply\nMediaBro 4 points 5 days ago You mass import the third world, you get third world politics. This will get even worse, by the way. The Hindu v Muslim v Sikh wars are coming to your local neighborhood very soon. Your country will become a blend of South African, Indian and Pakistani politics. I genuinely do see Civil Wars within 5 to 6 yrs and I said, Civil Wars, not Civil War because it's going to be Balkanized wars happening between multiple different communities pitching themselves against each other. A different kind of horror is then having multiple countries across the planet try and either fund their community's side or worse, send in troops to allow their side to win or bring back the balance and keep the truce. Whatever happens, it's not going to go well for the US or the world in the next coming decade. permalink award report block reply\nNewBurner04 3 points 5 days ago Nig no like Nog! permalink award report block reply\nKeepingAmericaGreat 3 points 5 days ago Oh, brother! permalink award report block reply\nWeneverleft 3 points 5 days ago X, Balkanization is the process by which a country or region breaks apart into smaller, often unfriendly political units, typically along ethnic, cultural, or religious lines. The term originated from the fragmentation of the Balkan Peninsula in the early 20th century following the breakup of empires like the Ottoman Empire. This fragmentation can result in ethnic conflict and political instability within the newly divided areas. permalink award report block reply Weneverleft 2 points 5 days ago All by design,  Destroy America from within.

The Somalians control Minnesota district 5 because that's where they all are. And by controlling that one district, now the entire state is blue. Seriously, look at the electoral maps. The rest of Minnesota is either red or leans red. But district 5 is big enough (it's the core of the twin cities) to move the entire state solidly blue. thats why there is so much fraud and it's tolerated: Somalians give Minnesota to the Democrats. Without them, Minnesota goes Republican. permalink award report block reply\nbooblitchutz 3 points 5 days ago Good to know there is at least ONE functional division on the left that can result in electoral losses. They caucus together even when half of them want to kill all Jews and the other half ARE Jews. permalink award report block reply\nPhantomShield72 3 points 5 days ago Darude Sandstorm Tribe permalink award report block reply\nPappy_Gunn 3 points 5 days ago I say build a fence around it and dump 500 machetes in there.

So long as they were slaughtering each other, things were relatively peaceful elsewhere.

Somalia changed that.  Here you have a country where just about everybody is caught up in hatried and fighting.  You stop and old lady on the street and ask her if she wants peace, and she'll say, yes, of course, I pray for it daily.  All the things you'd expect her to say.  Then ask her if she would be willing for her clan to share power with another in order to have that pease, and she'll say, 'With those muderers and thieves?  I'd die first.'  -- Blackhawk Down. permalink award report block reply\ntdee3000 1 points 5 days ago skinny on skinny violence permalink award report block reply\nGtsx 1 points 5 days ago Welcome to the old world.
