He has to navigate the swamp and it may not always go our way. Deals need to be made because he is not the king. Not happy about it but I have no problem with people calling him out either. permalink award report block reply mojorisen -7 points 2 hours ago I dont even know what this forum is anymore. Looks like the concern trolls, undercover leftists and bots have taken over the forum. READ THE RULES:  Be here for MAGA and Trump There are countless forums for concern trolling, anti-Trump sentiment etc.  You might even try Hasan Piker's stream.  It seems to align more closely to your feelings on Trump. permalink award report block reply Goozmania 13 points 2 hours ago Trump is currently not here for MAGA or Trump. permalink parent award report block reply EuphoricTrillby 7 points 2 hours ago We’re not a cult. Stop acting like how Leftists talk about Obama. permalink parent award report block reply mathteach314159 2 points 39 minutes ago If we want to keep cheering for Trump, he needs to not do this kind of shit with no explanation as to how it might be necessary to open up 50 year mortgages and bring in more chinese spies to our universities. At least on the H1b topic he told us why, and apparently its because we is retarded and sheeet. permalink parent award report block reply YaharaRiver -20 points 3 hours ago fag Cry harder that Trump has completely confused you. I’m thrilled that the trolls are completely COMPLETELY! out of the loop and have no idea what he will do or suggest next. Remember: All his remarks are 100% LEGAL, thx to the GAY muslim Kenyan fucking with Smith-Mundt 😆 permalink award report block reply brutustyberius -20 points 3 hours ago Since when is this an anti trump site. Almost worse than CNN. What the fuck people? Through thick and thin. Don't you think he needs a little support right now. Don't you think that you, yourself could be doing more instead of piling on. Summer soldiers, all of you. permalink award report block reply Datamancer 25 points 3 hours ago Cheerleading for loser policies is not 'pro Trump'.  Getting him to course correct is. permalink parent award report block reply LiquidSun 17 points 3 hours ago We're not married to the fucking guy. We've been duped. permalink parent award report block reply mathteach314159 1 points 38 minutes ago I agree with the sentiment that this last week has been pretty tough, but I think your comment is an over reaction. permalink parent award report block reply Rydanovich 15 points 3 hours ago Nobody is above criticism. If he suddenly turned around and say whites are born evil and this is a black world, would you still blindly throw in with him? permalink parent award report block reply mojorisen -9 points 2 hours ago While this may be true, you are in the wrong forum.  Follow the rules or be exported. Either find another forum (maybe r/politics) or start your own forum called "I like Trump when he does exactly what I want" forum. permalink parent award report block reply Rydanovich 3 points 1 hour ago Too much of a democrat in you.

This most recent interview has been a catastrophy, but most of what's happening now is outside of what he campaigned on. He hasn't spoken negatively about H1B since 2019 or so; Trump 2.0 is a tech-bro, and "loooves" H1B; that certainly doens't mean we have to. permalink parent award report block reply Be_The_Change 1 points 3 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply
