But the pro-globalist needs change a lot because they\u2019re factionated and their plans never work perfectly when they aren\u2019t blowing up in their face. permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 3 points 2 days ago I am always wondering why they are idiots to be honest. I mean if the globalists truly wanted their government they would have pushed for space colonization because that gives them one avenue that they can trick the bigger idiots to be their workforce while implementing what they want. They get their own little kingdom in space that they can then leave the solar system without anybody stopping them. It really does boggle the mind they can't even figure that out, and that is using their logic. permalink parent award report block reply MSG1000 1 points 2 days ago It would undermine their control with current technology the same way overseas colonies did. And the innovations would solve problems they want to continue to exploit. permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 2 points 2 days ago I mean they could easily make themselves be viewed as champion of the people, but then again we are talking about people that hate the common people.
