Fuck commies. permalink award report block reply Viewer01 61 points 5 days ago It is the most criminal thing. Faggots in Cali and nyc purposely cause massive inflation in their states. Then these fucks sell their inflated assets and go to more fiscally responsible states and inflate shit there too. All because we are captured by usurers who swapped us off the gold standard and onto fiat. permalink parent award report block reply Easzq8 2 points 5 days ago Do you suggest a ban on buying houses for investment purposes? That would be a fairly overreaching legislation, would it not? permalink parent award report block reply StruggleSession 8 points 5 days ago A progressive property tax that makes home owners pay little or nothing for their first primary residence and then increases exponentially for each new house would discourage hoarding. Another option is just deporting immigrants to increase the supply of houses or ban foreigners from owning or purchasing US property. Anything is better than making it impossible for Americans to buy homes and raise families. permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 2 points 5 days ago I would say do all of that with the last one having monthly inspections if allowed. permalink parent award report block reply UpvoteBot 2 points 4 days ago This is exactly the solution. Particularly the deportation of ALL illegals and the majority of Visa holders. You can directly track the increase in real estate pricing to the increase in illegal immigration. All these brown folks have to live someplace. The same fact holds true with the price of groceries, healthcare, welfare spending, literally everything. The one thing that does not increase with the number of illegals entering the country, is prosperity and wealth. Deporting all illegals remains the number one most important thing that can be done to increase the quality of life for American citizens. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

Inflation is always too much money chasing too little a supply. It's kind of baked in to wherever you live. In NYC, there is almost no land available of new housing, so the price goes up. Due to the increases in prices, companies have to pay more for the best people so salaries go up. So it seems that this is mostly a function of land scarcity in mature markets. And you have the opposite going on in shitholes like West Virginia where housing is really cheap. But decent jobs are hard to come by and culturally, it's a fucking dump. And there is not exactly a rush of people moving to WV-  and there is a reason for that. permalink parent award report block reply EdgyUsernamexX69Xx 7 points 5 days ago The way markets actually work is not found in an economics textbook. permalink parent award report block reply ShitFromShinola -5 points 5 days ago Is that so, Professor.

ShadowInv 3 points 5 days ago Equity locusts permalink parent award report block reply ShitFromShinola 1 points 5 days ago What's the solution, shit stain? permalink parent award report block reply 420praiseit894 2 points 5 days ago People with a lot of money from NYC flee to states with cheaper living, driving demand in those areas up past reasonable price levels for natives. Government policy also affects inflation. Hence, voting for leftist shit drives up cost of living in their own state, and then they flee like parasites to better states, which drives up costs there as well. Housing market costs are heavily influenced by expatriates from more expensive areas being willing to pay a lot more. permalink parent award report block reply ShitFromShinola -1 points 5 days ago So stop sniveling and move to West Virginia, then. Then those hillbillies will blame you for driving up the cost of a single wide trailer in Morgantown. See how this works? permalink parent award report block reply TrumpsBigBalls 1 points 5 days ago not sure why the downvotes as your statement is accurate. permalink parent award report block reply ShitFromShinola 1 points 5 days ago People need a scapegoat- someone to blame for their misfortune. Houses cost more in desirable places and less in shitholes. That's the way the world works. In markets where real estate is higher- so are salaries for most professions. A lot of it is that they resent the fact that Blue cities are so much more desirable (including better jobs)  due to the many things they offer above and beyond what is available in small town or rural America. But that is literally the way it is any you'd go in the entire world. permalink parent award report block reply AlmostFullyDilated -10 points 5 days ago lol what? as a American I can buy land wherever the fuck I want .

They could be supporters of Andrew \"how am I not in prison after purposefully leading NY grandparents to their deaths?\" Cuomo. Perhaps, even they think handing NYC to an unemployable, Karl Marx quoting, economically illiterate bum is a recipe for disaster. permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 2 points 5 days ago Your name is MEGA BASED!!!!

I\u2019m only familiar with Texas where I live, and the vast majority of people I know who lived here from CA or NY in last 5nywars have been conservatives. permalink parent award report block reply snoopy3210 4 points 5 days ago No the republicans in NY were the first to go to florida, and now the independents and the former democrats registered Republicans. Not bad. permalink parent award report block reply DeplorachuIChooseYou 4 points 5 days ago I just don't see it. especially when you look at CO, NM, NJ, and WA. Even if that is true, It's a ripple effect. those locusts will destroy that state so far that even the socialites will flee. Look at areas in Texas now. Look at Montana apparently becoming a hotspot for Californians, and what Idaho could become. permalink parent award report block reply BidensBodyDouble 2 points 5 days ago The state keeps getting more red. My county was reliably blue. Same with the neighboring. Both are purple now and lean red. There's some shitty local politics where dems win but that's more a result of Rs not getting involved in local politics. The fucking fear mongering is insane. As someone who's been here 15 years I've watched it turn. permalink parent award report block reply SarsourCuntReturns 1 points 5 days ago Can confirm about NM. A lot of people who moved from CA to NM stayed voting blue because they're retarded. permalink parent award report block reply Govtizbad 4 points 5 days ago Build the Florida wall edit: I'm being downvoted by feds and commies.

Your money is no one elses but your own, unless you choose to give it freely and it should be to someone deserving.  The money and property of others is not yours to give away. permalink parent award report block reply Paydro 0 points 5 days ago Dont worry, the faggots who leave NY cause of politics arent coming to FL to vote blue. We're in a suburb of Orlando and I'd say 90% of our neighbors are Christian and Republican. Every teacher our kids have had in public school so far (4  kids) has been a Christian and regular church goer.

Paid 128k for a property with my bitch ass ex wife when things were good.  It is worth 450k now.  We sold it for 138k in our divorce at that point in time. Fuck this shit man. permalink parent award report block reply BidensBodyDouble 2 points 5 days ago Been to a Home Depot lately? Can't do shit for 100k let alone build a house.

And unlikely these people end up anywhere north of Boca/Jupiter. More likely - they leave after their first hurricane. All those SoFL transplants from covid still haven't really had to go through one. I suspect a mass exodus if/when it happens.

Housing prices in other areas aren't necessarily going to follow suit. permalink parent award report block reply BidensBodyDouble 1 points 4 days ago Yea I agree that's prolly a factor but it's more likely the FHA loans that were getting bailed out by the Biden admin. For about the last 2 yrs of Biden they were paying people's mortgages to not cause a housing crash. FL had something like 3 cities who were in the top 5 recipients on that list. permalink parent award report block reply MudDog 1 points 5 days ago now?! permalink parent award report block reply Greenhills 9 points 5 days ago All the CEOs will work from billionaires bunker while their employees are required to be onsite five days a week at the Babylonian buildings they left behind permalink award report block reply JackLemon 7 points 5 days ago That was the psy-ops.

Inflation is always too much money chasing too little a supply. It's kind of baked in to wherever you live. In NYC, there is almost no land available of new housing, so the price goes up. Due to the increases in prices, companies have to pay more for the best people so salaries go up. So it seems that this is mostly a function of land scarcity in mature markets.
