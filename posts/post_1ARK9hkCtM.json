Vegas isnt really part of Nevada anymore. Clark county has been effectively colonized by LA.  It's not part of Nevada any more it's SoCal now.   Its been solid blue and dragging down the rest of the state for years. To be fair.  Vegas has already been wrecked by the left and is only riding what remains of a now popped tourism bubble. Products of the post war baby boom(45-65) boomers and generation Jones.  Are what built Vegas.  Gambling the kids college funds away, chasing the false hope of something for nothing. All the cheap rooms and free or at least cheap entertainment was being subsidized by boomers who seemed to enjoy loosing big at the tables.  They've been ageing out and are no longer footing the bill. The currently emerging clientele is younger and primarily of a sensation seeking motive.  Flashing lights and feels.  Sensory overload is thier high.  They aren't as interested in gambling as they are in night clubs, 'hangover' style buffoonery and 'cool story bro' shenanigans. Those things are getting more and more expensive as the subsidies previously provided by boomers eager to loose at the tables dry up. The other issue is all of the transplants living there as part of some bucket list, \"wouldn't it be cool to live there,\" side quest.  The population there has exploded, and not because of any tangible or real economic opportunity. The place got crowded up because of all the people who just want to say they've lived there.  People who show up willing to pay anything for the privilege, but still haven't lined up a job to pay for the adventure and the bragging rights they crave.  Most of those folks only last 3yrs before returning to where they came from.  Like so many destitute and broken prodigal sons.  But that revolving door of suckers and wild eyed dreamers has wildly inflated the housing market and driven down wages. Vegas has never been a secure or predictable thing.  It's always wobbled between boom and bust.  But the last 20yrs has seen the place arrive at its least stable and most likely to catastrophically collapse condition yet. Trump doesn't need to do anything.  Nevada's cash cow has already been teetering on the brink.  For a while.  It's actually very likely to fall over all on its own. permalink parent award report block reply BoomShtick 5 points 2 days ago Same can be said with Washoe county permalink parent award report block reply Steve56775 3 points 2 days ago Have to agree, the California libtards moved here to escape Commiefornia and turned the population centers into California.
