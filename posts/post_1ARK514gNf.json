Killing is the point of Lindsey Graham's political career.

But your observation makes quite a bit more sense \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 permalink parent award report block reply Throwingway22 3 points 6 days ago If you want to get rid of Graham, you should look at why Graham has the influence he does instead of complaining about what he leverages that influence towards. You can like everything that Thomas Massie and Rand Paul say they support, but their actions are the reason that people like Graham have so much power. Rand Paul got kicked out of the negotiations for the BBB because he was being an incalcitrant pain in the ass. Instead of getting something, anything at all, he gained precisely zero ground--in fact you can argue he lost ground--in pursuit of his goals. Because he was a guaranteed no vote, someone like Graham's vote is more valuable and Graham knows that he can get a little something for voting yes. And then, what, it gets floated that it's Nancy Mace that is going to challenge Graham for his seat? Just a waste of time. Demand better representation from the people you think are better than Graham and Graham will have a lot less influence. permalink award report block reply keeman 1 points 6 days ago The compromise between poison and food is just poison.  The reason conservatism constantly loses ground is that progressives and globalists never moderate their demands.  No matter how much you give them they demand more.  Compromise is the slow road to communism. permalink parent award report block reply Throwingway22 3 points 6 days ago Progressives took everything in increments for decades. They slowly took over by compromising over and over and over again until we get to the point of sterilizing teens. Barack Obama was running on a platform of civil unions, opposed to gay marriage. It's just complete ignorance of how we got where we are to say what you said. Massie and Pauls solution to your food analogy is that it's better to starve demanding a steak than be satisfied with a bit of spam for a meal. permalink parent award report block reply snoopy3210 0 points 6 days ago Graham is CIA.
