For example, in the Arizona sector, ICE leadership in Phoenix is loathe to find, arrest and deport any illegals who haven’t committed crimes in the US other than illegal entry. Constantly moaning that it’s wrong to arrest and detain/deport “non crim” aliens (those whose only crime is illegal entry itself).  This is one big reason deportations are lower than expected. It’s why changes by DHS are needed in regional ICE leadership. permalink award report block reply PlantTrees 1 points 6 hours ago Guess they showed him the error of his ways :D permalink award report block reply
