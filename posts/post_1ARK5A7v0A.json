HillarysFUPA 38 points 3 days ago Dumbass here... I don't get it either... I have some guesses that are probably all wrong. permalink award report block reply kestral 46 points 3 days ago The heatmaps are from a real 2012 study on \"moral circles\" by psychologists Peter Singer and others. The graph is a polar-area plot where the circles represent \"rings of relational distance\" from the self (inner rings = immediate family/close friends; outer rings = distant strangers, all humans, animals, or even the environment). Participants rated how much they care if harm happens to people/groups at each distance. Heat intensity (red/yellow = high concern; blue/green = low) shows where empathy peaks. Key findings were: on average, Conservatives' concern drops off sharply after close kin/nation (inner 4-5 rings), focusing empathy narrowly (e.g., \"my family first\"). Liberals' primary concern extends farther out (to ring 10+ like \"all people\" or global issues). permalink parent award report block reply SickOfNeoPolitics 38 points 3 days ago The reach of the areas is not the concern so much as where the focus is. Liberals literally care more about rocks and trees than their own families. Fundamentally mindbroken people. permalink parent award report block reply bigdickhangsright 16 points 3 days ago I'd posit that they don't care about anything other than controlling what others think. And they're a bunch of lazy asses so if you combine these you will see why they become actors, professors, teachers, etc. permalink parent award report block reply kestral 4 points 3 days ago Nothing matters to them except what they think they're supposed to say matters permalink parent award report block reply HillarysFUPA 2 points 3 days ago That's why they abandon people who don't think like them and only try to associate with like-minded people .. the like-minded are already under control, so they can try to focus on others they don't have control of yet. permalink parent award report block reply DatabaseCentrals 6 points 3 days ago The thing is they would always be chasing something they'll never see. If they became close to the people far off then they would stop caring about them due to the pattern. It means they care about nothing other than themselves and want the worst for those directly around them. permalink parent award report block reply SickOfNeoPolitics 2 points 3 days ago The outer rings do not represent people. Hell, anything past ring 9 isn't even mammals. permalink parent award report block reply learntocode 2 points 3 days ago This is EXACTLY what happens.

I would rather die than have my kid seriously hurt. Not a hard concept. permalink parent award report block reply glasses2020 2 points 3 days ago An important note is that they only had 100 \"moral units\" to allocate to the circles. permalink parent award report block reply Piglips 0 points 3 days ago Pseudo-science. Now do phrenology, engrams, palm-reading, corprlite-reading, astrology, chicken feet and engrams. permalink parent award report block reply Moose_Antlers 2 points 3 days ago It's normal to care about those closest to you first. Liberals tend to have wildly dysfunctional relationships with those people so they align themselves with larger and wider groups. If you've heard the expression in-group preference or out-group preference, the normal human has an in-group preference. We're biologically hardwired, it is instinctual, for us to prefer and maintain high loyalty to those who are most like us: family, extended family, local community, etc. That's in-group preference. Liberals reject all of those things and prefer the other. They specifically prefer people and objects that are different or abnormal or unfamiliar. Its why liberal white women fetishize black and brown people and hate white men. Out-group preference. This heatmap should look like a dart board or a bullseye in a normal person, focused around the center. Sweeney's does. That's normal. The Leftist's looks like a comet, wildly off-center and facing away from the center. That's this out-group preference visualized. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 28 points 3 days ago You got a shit ton of con inc boomers falling into the top category. Historians are going to debate forever on a generation so wealthy but seemingly hated their children. permalink award report block reply TNfootDoc 13 points 3 days ago Probs 50/50.

At least in my experience. permalink parent award report block reply lul_cheto 2 points 3 days ago , I guess his family sucks like mine does, who are greedy and poor. But my wife's family works hard, has tons of money, and helps everyone, even putting a down payment for a newlyweds house they knew from church. permalink parent award report block reply heavyD 6 points 3 days ago Not all children, just children like you that blamed them for your fck ups. permalink parent award report block reply Iremembermypassword 9 points 3 days ago Our society used to have Elders, now we only have the Elderly. permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 5 points 3 days ago And spinsters.

A lot of boomers in general are greedy and hoarding well to blow it on a nursing home.

Case in point. Irrational dickhead that takes zero accountability for the last 35 years of politics. My family was extremely gracious in my younger years and this has helped me get into the top 5-10% of incomes and net worths by age. I do however look at others my age who could have gotten this help but did not. These are the odious sort I refer to and they are deserving of the freshest h1b Indian drs and Jamal at the nursing homes. permalink parent award report block reply heavyD 1 points 3 days ago So you are saying you wouldn't have shit if they hadn't have given you some of what They earned?

Loser. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 0 points 3 days ago I own five houses lmao. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying this. My folks were gracious and relatively I\u2019m thriving. Whereas I look at my cohorts and see them being told to bootstrap in an unfair system by malicious boomers. It\u2019s funny watching the boomers melt down because they know they were shitty parents. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments... heavyD 1 points 3 days ago Your parents would probably enjoy the indians more than you. permalink parent award report block reply Moose_Antlers 2 points 3 days ago That generation didn't hate their children. They hated their parents and resolved to be radically different from them when they themselves became parents. They rejected the values their parents had instead of passing them on. Instead, they were hyper-permissive and indulgent of their children, failed to lay down moral boundaries and normal discipline, taught \"tolerance\" and \"acceptance\" that they'd learned in their 60s-era rights protests. They taught their kids communist values and rejected traditional morality. That's where a lot of the issues post-boomer comes from. Obviously, it's not all boomers. It's heavily driven by the hippie types. But that's the origin. This generation hated their WW2-era parents who had literally lived through hell (Great Depression + world war) and tried to pass on those lessons during a time of absolute economic plenitude. The kids couldn't understand, and were often downrage of repressed anger/rage/PTSD. The kids (boomers) hated their parents, not their children. permalink parent award report block reply drattastic1 2 points 3 days ago How crybabies turn this into a gen-war is beyond me.

Conservatives have more empathy and moral allocation for friends, family and community. You couldnt get it without the study so not fair to say someone doesnt get it without having seen the source. Study just supports what we have known for a long time and backs up the concept of suicidal empathy and white liberal women being the only people ever to have outgroup preference.

The graph is a polar-area plot where the circles represent \"rings of relational distance\" from the self (inner rings = immediate family/close friends; outer rings = distant strangers, all humans, animals, or even the environment). Participants rated how much they care if harm happens to people/groups at each distance. Heat intensity (red/yellow = high concern; blue/green = low) shows where empathy peaks. Key findings were: on average, Conservatives' concern drops off sharply after close kin/nation (inner 4-5 rings), focusing empathy narrowly (e.g., \"my family first\"). Liberals' primary concern extends farther out (to ring 10+ like \"all people\" or global issues). permalink parent award report block reply SickOfNeoPolitics 38 points 3 days ago The reach of the areas is not the concern so much as where the focus is.

They hated their parents and resolved to be radically different from them when they themselves became parents. They rejected the values their parents had instead of passing them on. Instead, they were hyper-permissive and indulgent of their children, failed to lay down moral boundaries and normal discipline, taught \"tolerance\" and \"acceptance\" that they'd learned in their 60s-era rights protests. They taught their kids communist values and rejected traditional morality. That's where a lot of the issues post-boomer comes from. Obviously, it's not all boomers. It's heavily driven by the hippie types. But that's the origin. This generation hated their WW2-era parents who had literally lived through hell (Great Depression + world war) and tried to pass on those lessons during a time of absolute economic plenitude. The kids couldn't understand, and were often downrage of repressed anger/rage/PTSD.

Case in point. Irrational dickhead that takes zero accountability for the last 35 years of politics. My family was extremely gracious in my younger years and this has helped me get into the top 5-10% of incomes and net worths by age. I do however look at others my age who could have gotten this help but did not. These are the odious sort I refer to and they are deserving of the freshest h1b Indian drs and Jamal at the nursing homes. permalink parent award report block reply heavyD 1 points 3 days ago So you are saying you wouldn't have shit if they hadn't have given you some of what They earned?

They hated their parents and resolved to be radically different from them when they themselves became parents. They rejected the values their parents had instead of passing them on. Instead, they were hyper-permissive and indulgent of their children, failed to lay down moral boundaries and normal discipline, taught \"tolerance\" and \"acceptance\" that they'd learned in their 60s-era rights protests. They taught their kids communist values and rejected traditional morality. That's where a lot of the issues post-boomer comes from. Obviously, it's not all boomers. It's heavily driven by the hippie types. But that's the origin. This generation hated their WW2-era parents who had literally lived through hell (Great Depression + world war) and tried to pass on those lessons during a time of absolute economic plenitude. The kids couldn't understand, and were often downrage of repressed anger/rage/PTSD. The kids (boomers) hated their parents, not their children. permalink parent award report block reply\ndrattastic1 2 points 3 days ago How crybabies turn this into a gen-war is beyond me.

Conservatives have more empathy and moral allocation for friends, family and community. You couldnt get it without the study so not fair to say someone doesnt get it without having seen the source. Study just supports what we have known for a long time and backs up the concept of suicidal empathy and white liberal women being the only people ever to have outgroup preference. This is also why they are more common victims of crime. permalink award report block reply\nNADSAQ 1 points 3 days ago i thought this was a map of eye-tracking movement, as in the host was so repulsive that people looked away permalink award report block reply\nExileOnClownStreet 0 points 3 days ago If only they had left out 6, 7, 8 and 9, I'd be down with the whole list.
