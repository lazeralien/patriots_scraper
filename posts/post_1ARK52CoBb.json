Not sure what AIPAC did for your intel agency to invite a murderous radical Islamist and welcome him with open arms after helping open the border. permalink parent award report block reply ReleasetheList 8 points 6 days ago Seriously? The only reason he was installed is because he agreed to open up dialogue with Israel and agreed to certain terms. Do you not know anything about geopolitics?

Define_Assault 31 points 6 days ago We already are\u2026but only one side is fighting permalink award report block reply josiborg 6 points 6 days ago Not even one side permalink parent award report block reply StCharlie 5 points 6 days ago Paint the british crusade flag and Christ is King on the street in high population Muslim areas.  Swap out a DEI or foreign countries flag for it and install signage.  Sending a message is important.  Muslims have spent years fighting a atypical war versus the U.S.  The strategy to combat Muslims overtaking cities must be fought in an atypical way as well.  Psychological.  Anonymous.  Unexpected.  Exploitable.  The men gather at mosques, their call to prayers should have to compete with Christ is King over an intercom.  Draw your best Muhammad contest.  Your goal is not to fight your enemy but bait them into a fight.  Make sure you pick someone that looks easily angered.  They will be the most exploitable to move to an action that they will regret.  You need to draw out their darkness for everyone to see.  And remember the most important part:  ABR - Always be recording. One last thought.  Make your bait easy for you to do.  Don't make it too complicated.  A simple picture of Muhammad drawn on the wall or a notepad with the name Muhammad at the top to be clear on the intention that you are drawing him.  We don't have laws against drawing a picture.  Draw to your hearts content.  If your identity revolves around your prophet being so sacred that he can't be criticized then that is a huge weakness.  Have some fun with it.  Pork>Muhammad.  The Bacon gods killed Muhammad.  Let's have fun, ok?  Just like in any competition, there are head fakes, unexpected plays, getting in your opponents head and rattling them, if you have to show your plan make it a fake one, watch videos, find out who you are dealing with and why they are here.  Use AI to slander them.  Video of your opponent saying something bad about Muhammad and how much they love Jesus Christ. permalink parent award report block reply Afeazo 5 points 6 days ago Exactly, one side is just going to roll over and allow it to happen. \"Sharia is preferable to avoiding violence on the street, just give them what they want\" permalink parent award report block reply jcd_007 4 points 6 days ago The left openly welcomes that evil. permalink parent award report block reply Chad_Prime 19 points 6 days ago If that happens, God forbid... Because there will not be an off switch. We will not stop until all Muslims and their enablers are 100% cleansed from our land. permalink award report block reply The_Bloofy_Bullshark 17 points 6 days ago If a modern SS-type organization was formed to wipe out Muslims, I would immediately join. 100% serious. Every last one of them. Never saw them as people, especially when overseas. permalink parent award report block reply Saltish 7 points 6 days ago I know this will probably put me on a list, but I actually 100% understand how people supported the Nazis in Germany. All I have to do is replace Jews with Muslims. I'd prefer exporting them back to their countries because I'm not inherently cruel, but if the only options are a.) ovens, or b.) letting them take over our civilization, I'm with a.) all the way, no apologies. So sorry that I want my civilization and culture to survive and don't want all future White women to be subjugated by a barbaric cult. I'm quirky that way. permalink parent award report block reply Probably_tryna_sleep 2 points 6 days ago Meh, we\u2019re probably all already on watchlists anyways. I have no problem with the casual Muslim who likes a BLT and drinks some beers while watching the game. The extreme ones though that want to impose their own wild rule of law on the rest of society? Nah, fuck em. If we\u2019re going to do a crusade here, then say when lol permalink parent award report block reply Seeker_17 2 points 6 days ago Yes, same here. permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 6 points 6 days ago There's gonna be so many vengeance killings on both sides due to the amount of personal grievances that have built up. permalink parent award report block reply Seeker_17 3 points 6 days ago Yes. The sooner the better. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply magnokor 17 points 6 days ago The USA has been at war with moslems for 249.4 years. Most have only noticed it for a few years during that span. The moslems have been at war with everyone since around year 600. A region can only ever have two possible numbers of them, 0% or 100%. It will be good news for many countries when one country ignites, with the locals versus the invading heathens. Of course, the UN and their media and the invaders want to keep that from happening, as they know they would lose and they are guaranteed to win as long as the countries allow them to stay and also have open borders legal mass immigration so they can continue to bring in their invading army. permalink award report block reply gillonba 7 points 6 days ago \"From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli!\" Iirc the Marine Corps was basically created to deal with Mohammedan slavers in Africa.  (Still waiting for my reparashuns) edit: The moslems have been at war with everyone since around year 600. You are spot on correct.  It is really disappointing to see so many people here who pretend that this isn't the case permalink parent award report block reply Seeker_17 7 points 6 days ago America was discovered the same year the Spaniards kicked the last muzzie out. Columbus was looking for new routes to India to avoid the Barbary pirates and Ottomans. They never tell you that little detail. permalink parent award report block reply josiborg 3 points 6 days ago Andrew Jackson fought war against Islam. They are used by joos to kill Christianity permalink parent award report block reply Nachos_and_cheese 13 points 6 days ago I have been saying the same thing for years. Every mosk has weapons in the basement, an armory for when they take up arms. I have uncles in the RCMP and there is a big mosk near toronto and they know its full of enough weapons to start an army. But they are not allowed to talk about it let alone raid the place. I was told that like 15 years ago, i cant imagine how bad it is now with all the trudeau human trash he imported. permalink award report block reply Groomerboomer 2 points 6 days ago Mosk permalink parent award report block reply FrankDuncan 2 points 6 days ago Alon? permalink parent award report block reply Nachos_and_cheese 1 points 4 days ago huh? permalink parent award report block reply Groomerboomer 1 points 4 days ago You wrote mosk instead of mosque permalink parent award report block reply Nachos_and_cheese 1 points 3 days ago i also write moslem instead of muslim because they dont deserve respect and it might trigger the goat fuckers. Much like i put ham/bacon in the halal coolers in the supermarket every time i am there, sometimes next to a muzzie lol permalink parent award report block reply Saltish 10 points 6 days ago And half the country will be fighting on BEHALF of the Muslims. Because they need to oppose \"Nazis.\" Mark these words as well. permalink award report block reply Rope_Tree_Journalist 2 points 6 days ago I'm okay killing them too. permalink parent award report block reply Nellie_the_Beaut 1 points 6 days ago Daniel Pearl comes to mind.

I want every single one of them gone, I don't give a shit about freedom of a religion. I am an atheist but it is very clear what religions stand for what values, and Islam is a cancer on every population it touches. permalink award report block reply Seeker_17 4 points 6 days ago Islam isn't even a religion, it's more like an ideology or all encompassing system that also regulates the lifes of unbelievers. The way around the freedom of religion thing is to treat Islam as something else . permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply 1_Badcop 7 points 6 days ago Um, pretty sure muslims are already killing us here from time to time...or does he just mean at some point we'll be allowed to fight back? permalink award report block reply SpaceWizard 7 points 6 days ago And who can we thank for that? permalink award report block reply Seeker_17 4 points 6 days ago Catholic charities and other woke churches. permalink parent award report block reply SpaceWizard 2 points 5 days ago That's true, they had major contributions to the destruction of our country. They brought in TONS of illegals permalink parent award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 4 points 6 days ago The real question isn\u2019t \"who gets blamed,\" but why anyone thinks importing or incubating irreconcilable conflicts is sustainable. Blame follows power and narrative control, but the root cause would be decades of policy failures,  unchecked migration without assimilation, foreign policy blowback, and domestic polarization weaponized by elites. No group \"deserves\" this future. The way to avoid it isn\u2019t more blame, it\u2019s ruthless pragmatism about borders, culture, and security. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply Thomm 7 points 6 days ago That day is today my friend. permalink award report block reply Hallelujah_Jesus 6 points 6 days ago I hope it doesn't come to that. permalink award report block reply 1_Badcop 5 points 6 days ago Too late. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply GeorgeBailey 6 points 6 days ago Kill the goats first so that they can\u2019t try to reproduce. permalink award report block reply Khryn_Tzu 6 points 6 days ago Exodus 22:2 -  \"If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed.\" DEUS.

The deep state overlooked the fact that the 3rd worlders that they flooded us with are majority Roman Catholic.   Also many of the Muslims in America when they have kids the kids inevitably get more exposed to western values.  With each generation.  Western values destroy religion even Islam.  If you just cut them off from\nEntering the organic growth will be pretty tame religiously after a couple generations.  And Christianity will still be around. permalink award report block reply gaijin_ronin 4 points 6 days ago Yes and in a relatively short time too.  In addition white liberals (especially women) will also come to their aid (or rather be useful idiots to the slaughter).  It's going to start with some Weather Underground type shit and escalate. permalink award report block reply 2025WhatIsTrue 4 points 6 days ago Stay/get physically fit.  Go to the range regularly.

Time to get rid of the cancer permalink award report block reply Diversity_Fire 2 points 6 days ago It will likely immediately follow us bailing Europe out permalink award report block reply Shih_Tabed 2 points 6 days ago No they won't.  Everyone will sit back thinking things will be under control.  Eventually there will be concentrated mobs of 100s or 1000s of muslims walking right into homes and dragging people into the street for execution.  The only way they get pushed back is if they are killed.  Incendiaries are generally the best option for dealing with crowds and they are easy to craft.  There needs to be a massive movement that doesn't care about being called racists, nazis, all the fun words and gets the job done.  The movement needs to not care about the purge of all things left being called \"censorship\".  Everyone worried about their kids hating them.  They already do.  Its time to take back society for ourselves so we can get something out of it before we die. permalink award report block reply Megaboom2025 2 points 6 days ago One day?

Starting in NYC, Minnesota, Texas, Michigan, etc... Need to nip this shit in the bud now... permalink parent award report block reply Unboosted 2 points 5 days ago We already are. It was about 10 years ago that the NYC media said it would stop reporting on muslim attacks in NYC. There was an epidemic of muslim renting uhaul trucks and running over anyone they could. The last one I can remember being reported on was a uhaul barrelling down a bike path and like 9 ppl died. Its only gotten worse since then, but muslims are a protected class so go fuck yourself you filthy American I guess.

Shit, we should be doing it every day! permalink award report block reply Nellie_the_Beaut 1 points 5 days ago Yep. I dreamt about that very thing the night of 9/10/2001. Swarms of Arab men capturing and killing Americans on the grounds of Central Park. It was at night, I watched in horror from the woods lining the park with a small group of people running stealthily to escape. I was frozen in terror watching the carnage until a stranger grabbed me and pulled me along. \u201cC\u2019mon, we have to go! You can\u2019t help them now! Save yourself before they see you!\u201d  I looked up and the buildings all around the park were on fire, including two very tall skyscrapers.  We were able to escape and jumped into a car and drove off and I turned around and watched the chaos behind us. There was so much fire the sky looked like daytime. It was the worst nightmare I have ever had and I woke up yelling and in a sweat around 4am PT on 9/11/2001, and my husband asked me what was wrong.  I told him \u201cI just had the most awful nightmare\u2026 people were being massacred by Arab men in those white robes, it was so terrible\u2026 where did that come from??\u201d He patted me and said it was only a dream and to go back to sleep. I have never been to Central Park or New York.

It will be good news for many countries when one country ignites, with the locals versus the invading heathens. Of course, the UN and their media and the invaders want to keep that from happening, as they know they would lose and they are guaranteed to win as long as the countries allow them to stay and also have open borders legal mass immigration so they can continue to bring in their invading army. permalink award report block reply gillonba 7 points 6 days ago \"From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli!\" Iirc the Marine Corps was basically created to deal with Mohammedan slavers in Africa.

The way to avoid it isn\u2019t more blame, it\u2019s ruthless pragmatism about borders, culture, and security. permalink parent award report block reply\nnewdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\nThomm 7 points 6 days ago That day is today my friend. permalink award report block reply\nHallelujah_Jesus 6 points 6 days ago I hope it doesn't come to that. permalink award report block reply 1_Badcop 5 points 6 days ago Too late. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\n1_Badcop 5 points 6 days ago Too late. permalink parent award report block reply\nnewdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\nGeorgeBailey 6 points 6 days ago Kill the goats first so that they can\u2019t try to reproduce. permalink award report block reply\nKhryn_Tzu 6 points 6 days ago Exodus 22:2 -  \"If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed.\" DEUS.

The deep state overlooked the fact that the 3rd worlders that they flooded us with are majority Roman Catholic.   Also many of the Muslims in America when they have kids the kids inevitably get more exposed to western values.  With each generation.  Western values destroy religion even Islam.  If you just cut them off from\nEntering the organic growth will be pretty tame religiously after a couple generations.

Everyone will sit back thinking things will be under control.  Eventually there will be concentrated mobs of 100s or 1000s of muslims walking right into homes and dragging people into the street for execution.  The only way they get pushed back is if they are killed.  Incendiaries are generally the best option for dealing with crowds and they are easy to craft.  There needs to be a massive movement that doesn't care about being called racists, nazis, all the fun words and gets the job done.  The movement needs to not care about the purge of all things left being called \"censorship\".  Everyone worried about their kids hating them.  They already do.  Its time to take back society for ourselves so we can get something out of it before we die. permalink award report block reply\nMegaboom2025 2 points 6 days ago One day?

It was about 10 years ago that the NYC media said it would stop reporting on muslim attacks in NYC. There was an epidemic of muslim renting uhaul trucks and running over anyone they could.

Swarms of Arab men capturing and killing Americans on the grounds of Central Park. It was at night, I watched in horror from the woods lining the park with a small group of people running stealthily to escape. I was frozen in terror watching the carnage until a stranger grabbed me and pulled me along. \u201cC\u2019mon, we have to go! You can\u2019t help them now! Save yourself before they see you!\u201d  I looked up and the buildings all around the park were on fire, including two very tall skyscrapers.  We were able to escape and jumped into a car and drove off and I turned around and watched the chaos behind us. There was so much fire the sky looked like daytime. It was the worst nightmare I have ever had and I woke up yelling and in a sweat around 4am PT on 9/11/2001, and my husband asked me what was wrong.  I told him \u201cI just had the most awful nightmare\u2026 people were being massacred by Arab men in those white robes, it was so terrible\u2026 where did that come from??\u201d He patted me and said it was only a dream and to go back to sleep. I have never been to Central Park or New York.
