Which is only under consideration because Russia looked at the second backbone of its economy, the UDWS and thought to itself: \"Just how much maintenance could a river possibly need.\" And since Putin finally gave the restoration of its canals a high priority in 2014 and the other Caspian countries never stopped nagging, Iran is pretty much back to loosing the same old battle that always plagued this region: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K44DriPrLUk permalink parent award report block reply Internet_hugs 19 points 23 hours ago Let's look at some of those favorites from yesteryear! 1992 Netanyahu told the Knesset that Iran was \u201cwithin three to five years\u201d of becoming autonomous in its ability to develop and produce a nuclear bomb. 1995 Netanyahu wrote in his book Fighting Terrorism that Iran would be capable of producing nuclear bombs within three to five years. 1996 Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak told the UN Security Council that Iran would be able to produce nuclear weapons within eight years. 1999 Israel warned that unless pressure was applied, Iran would possess a nuclear capability within five years. 2003 Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said Israel\u2019s estimate was that Iran would have a bomb around 2009-11, and \u201csix to nine months\u201d for the know-how to produce a bomb from the enrichment stage. 2004 Israel\u2019s Military Intelligence estimated that once Iran had the ability to produce sufficient enriched uranium, the first bomb could follow within 1-3 years. 2009 Netanyahu said that \u201cour experts\u201d believed Iran was probably only one to two years away from a nuclear weapons capability. 2012 At the UN General Assembly, Netanyahu displayed a cartoon bomb and claimed Iran was \u201cvery close\u201d and would finish the medium-enrichment step by next spring/next summer and move on to the final stage. 2014 Netanyahu told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) that Iran must be stripped of all technologies with bomb-making potential; implied that Iran was close to crossing threshold. 2015 Netanyahu told the US Congress that Iran was weeks away from having enough fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. 2018 Netanyahu presented purported evidence of Iran\u2019s continued weapons effort (the \u201cAMAD project\u201d), saying Iran had preserved the knowledge to make a bomb very quickly. 2021 Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said Iran\u2019s breakout time (for enough fissile material) was around six months; for an actual weapon \u201caround one or two years\u201d. 2025 Netanyahu publicly stated that if not stopped, Iran \u201ccould produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time\u201d (months or even less) and declared an Israeli operation to pre-empt this. permalink award report block reply GA_Logic 8 points 23 hours ago Putting the US taxpayer on a subscription plan...very clever indeed. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 4 points 23 hours ago Bookmark this post permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -10 points 23 hours ago Is it wrong?

PEACE So why exactly SHOULDNT a country want nukes when the nuclear armed countries are trying to instigate WW3 (NATO/EU) or have spent trillions bombing the Middle East (US/Israel)? I bet you Venezuela wouldn't be in the same position if they had nukes. So if everything you do is getting you to the opposite of what you say you want, then you're full of shit. They create the conditions for Iran to want nukes, then bomb them for trying to get them. Guess what? They just want to bomb and kill more people. They just want to bomb Iran.

If you are willing to start wars over someone who \"bothers you\", I don't know if you're a rational human. If that's your threshold for conflict, I would recommend anger management. It becomes far worse when a nuclear conflict can be potentially on the line. How would Iran attack us if Israel was not there? With what technology? Please present examples. Have you thought maybe people don't like us cause we keep bombing them? I have this radical idea... Why don't we just stop getting into wars and bombing people halfway across the world? What does it get us? It's dumb. It wastes our money and it makes people hate us. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments...\nlul_cheto 3 points 21 hours ago Dumb take.

You know who doesn't have a problem with globalists doing color revolutions and getting bombed every year? North Korea. They got to walk the DMZ with Trump. PEACE So why exactly SHOULDNT a country want nukes when the nuclear armed countries are trying to instigate WW3 (NATO/EU) or have spent trillions bombing the Middle East (US/Israel)? I bet you Venezuela wouldn't be in the same position if they had nukes. So if everything you do is getting you to the opposite of what you say you want, then you're full of shit. They create the conditions for Iran to want nukes, then bomb them for trying to get them. Guess what? They just want to bomb and kill more people. They just want to bomb Iran. They just want a regime change. It's not about defending americans.
