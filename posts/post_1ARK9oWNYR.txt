Uniformly 90% across the city use EBT to do drugs and their kids get fuckall from it. The kids have to eat in school or not at all. Call Dems out for turning a blind eye to this.

You can buy fake piss that beats lab tests for $20 and a box of handwarmers for $10. You can buy boxers with a hidden pouch to keep it in, if they even bother making you turn out your pockets and lift your pant legs. I doubt they are going to do hair follicle tests as they are more expensive. permalink parent award report block reply TheThreeSeashells 1 points 1 hour ago No alcohol either.  If they want to party, they don't get to do so while we're paying them. Not to mention, no job + alcohol will generally equate to bad behavior. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 1 hour ago That is welfare for the medical industry.

Zskills 24 points 2 hours ago It's incomprehensible that this was ever not the case. But all it's going to do is increase the already staggering number of no-call &  no-shows after they get called in for their first day of work. We see it a ton, they get interviewed and they're excited for work, then they just ghost us.

They all have to re-apply with proof of citizenship. I renewed my license at the DMV in Philly and there were 500 people in line, mostly EBTishas. permalink parent award report block reply ListenJack 4 points 49 minutes ago “EBTishas” lol permalink parent award report block reply SaltyTitties4 16 points 2 hours ago I got let go of a manager job I had, in 2008 or 2009, when shit was happening, and the owner of the company sold it and the new owners were bringing their own people in.  So I applied for unemployment and got it…but every single week I had to send in three places where I applied, or I wouldn’t get the unemployment.  I had to list the name of the company, the position for which I applied, the phone number and address of the place, and the name of the person with whom I spoke or communicated. absolutely SNAP should have those same strict requirements. permalink award report block reply Fusion360 8 points 2 hours ago Most of the time, no one checks on that shit though. permalink parent award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste 1 points 1 hour ago During the great recession of 09 I was laid off.

The blue city narcopolies are ENTIRELY dependent on federal EBT handouts for their black money revenues. That's how the idea that there could be an urban gibs rap culture of black anarchists who spit in the face of society evolved. All of that dies out now.

We've seen it play out. The kangs are in control, because they'll riot and cause chaos if Trump does anything to threaten their welfare scam. The crux of it is, Trump isn't willing to do what it takes to control violent kangs. So they have the power, not him. Everyone knows this will be toothless. permalink parent award report block reply Here_we_go 2 points 1 hour ago Fake and ghey tweet. Zero sauce. 80 hr work volunteer was already agreed to in the bbb.

Love it! 😁 permalink award report block reply friedchicken 7 points 2 hours ago This is great. I will repeat: my local butcher has astronomical prices for food on SNAP's dime.  The rest of us are priced out while all the SNAP recipients buythe very expensive quality meats. permalink award report block reply Scot 6 points 2 hours ago Until an unelected leftist judge says no. These judges that have taken over the presidency need to be removed. permalink award report block reply Greenhills 6 points 2 hours ago Great. Now we’re wasting business’s time considering people who will never show up to work permalink award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 4 points 2 hours ago We have to make it so that if they get a JOB OFFER, then HHS/USDA is notified so they can be removed/reassessed for SNAP. permalink parent award report block reply trumpORbust 4 points 2 hours ago Ask business to share who declines a job offer -- good data to have, maybe they have better offer and employer needs to step up permalink parent award report block reply MySidesGoUp 4 points 2 hours ago The same business are cherry picking women and brown people because of tax credits. Ask them and hr and the irs for the fact- to hang… permalink parent award report block reply Krat 6 points 2 hours ago And when the corrupt commies just ignore this ? When they just blanket approve people anyways? Then what? Who will not get arrested this time ? permalink award report block reply Grond999 3 points 2 hours ago Business as usual. The swamp rolls on and on. permalink parent award report block reply aloha_snackbar22 5 points 2 hours ago I mean if its like unemployment benefits, all you gotta do is check a box saying "yes, I am looking for a job" and write down some random places that you "inquired" on. permalink award report block reply Patriot4TN 0 points 1 hour ago I see this trend rolling over to SNAP as well... ugh permalink parent award report block reply TheTelltaleFly 4 points 2 hours ago I hope they can cram some battery-making courses so they stand a chance.

Do you even hear yourself?  This is not what we voted for.  Cope. permalink award report block reply Zskills 5 points 2 hours ago I think most people are pro safety net, not pro hammock. But I totally agree that long term, all gibs need to be phased out, slowly, so local communities have a chance to develop that infrastructure to support people in need with private charity. permalink parent award report block reply Decepticons-superior 2 points 1 hour ago You're a true classical liberal. So am I. It's nice to see. Government should step in when the free market can't solve a problem. But only then. And it's never ideal. But necessary. permalink parent award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 2 hours ago Think it through. This is going to weed out about 80%.

SuperHonkey OP 10 points 2 hours ago Let's hope it has some teeth, from what I understood something to this end was already in place permalink parent award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 3 points 2 hours ago It was in place but Biden made it optional for the states to do it, so only the reddest states have it still in place. permalink parent award report block reply JesusTheOnlyWay 1 points 1 hour ago We already know it won't have teeth. We've seen it play out. The kangs are in control, because they'll riot and cause chaos if Trump does anything to threaten their welfare scam. The crux of it is, Trump isn't willing to do what it takes to control violent kangs. So they have the power, not him. Everyone knows this will be toothless. permalink parent award report block reply
