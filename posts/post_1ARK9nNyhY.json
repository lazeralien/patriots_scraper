Between this and off shore Americans are done permalink award report block reply Tmntnyc 1 points 8 hours ago If we want home-grown STEM talent in America, parents need to push their kids to study and test better. Due to grade inflation, this country's academic rigor has gone down the shitter. The worst culprit for grade inflation is that school funding is directly related to state test scores and graduation rates. So to secure funding, they will pass students that deserve to fail. The No Child Left Behind act is one of the causes. I kind of agree with Trump. Look at test scores nation wide, kids suck at math and science. In Asia they gruelingly study and test for higher level math and science and are extremely competitive. Average high schoolers in America now can barely read at a 5th grade level and nobody knows math beyond arithmetic anymore. Industry poachers engineers from Asia because they're disciplined and have more raw competency in math and science than Dennis from Pittsburg permalink award report block reply\nWizard_Glick 6 points 9 hours ago Trump is wrong... permalink award report block reply\nJustjayce 3 points 9 hours ago I'm sorry..
