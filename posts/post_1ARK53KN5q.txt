When I am dead, I will be alive in my new body in heaven and I will know it. permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 2 points 5 days ago Let's watch you do your mental gymnastics for this one... Faggot. Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 KJV
[5] For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. [6] Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. permalink parent award report block reply Ronaldus 0 points 5 days ago King Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes before Jesus died on the cross and paid for the sins of believers and then rose from the dead, defeating death. It's completely irrelevant and needs no mental gymnastics to explain. It requires mental retardation to be confused by it. It's funny that you thought this was confusing. 2 Corinthians 5:8 (LSB Strong's) 8 we are of good courage and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord. Luke 23:43 (ESV) 43 And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” permalink parent award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 0 points 5 days ago Typical papist propaganda. The entirety of the Bible supports soul sleep after death and before the resurrection. Your quote in Luke doesn't account for the fact that there was no punctuation in the original text. Therefore you can put the punctuation anywhere you like, as you have done. Here's where I put it. “Truly I say to you today, you will be with me in paradise.” Big difference, and it doesn't go against the rest of scripture. permalink parent award report block reply Ronaldus 0 points 5 days ago I merely quoted you a couple Bible verses that you hate. I can't help it that you don't like them. Oh, so you get to make up where punctuation goes? And lie about me doing it? Again, I merely cut and pasted text from Scripture. No changes. No punctuation movement or edit. I can't help it you hate God's Word. But your argument is with God, not with me. Here it is again: Luke 23:43 (ESV) 43 And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” And here is the only mistake I made. I accidentally quoted the ESV for some reason, which isn't my default text. Normally I default to the LSB. Luke 23:43 (LSB Strong's) 43 And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.” Thank you for admitting that you can squeeze out a meaning that is more suited to your heretical views if you just rewrite Scripture and move punctuation around. That was the most blatant and admitted form of projection I have ever seen in my life! You rock! Hey look! KJV! Luke 23:43 (KJV) 43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise. Watch this, heathen... https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm Look! Every version of the Bible on earth has the comma where I quoted it. Oh! Except for one Bible that a crackpot translated in 1933 from an Aramaic translation, so it is double translated, unlike any normal Bible. And it's done by a single retard. Dude, I just destroyed you so bad, you should learn the Law of Holes and run away. today: σήμερον (sēmeron) ADVERB - Today, now. Neuter of a presumed compound of the article ho and hemera; on the day; generally, now. It is an ADVERB in Greek. It modifies a VERB. There can be no comma between the adverb and verb, moron. Here is the VERB modified by the adverb: you will be
ἔσῃ (esē)

Strong's 1510: I am, exist. The first person singular present indicative; a prolonged form of a primary and defective verb; I exist.
