(Try This at Home) HaloGrow MemeWarsVet OP 7 points 3 hours ago Pretty much a year in now and, boy, does this sequel suck.  It started off with a flurry of feel-good EAs then, slowed way down. 1.  Deportations: Far, far below the rate implied during the campaign.
2.  The Economy: Everything, except gas, is still expensive as fuck.
3.  Deep State Arrests: Zero arrests for Deep State crimes.
4.  Election Integrity: As it stands, elections can, and will, still be stolen. And this foreign worker bullshit is not America first, to say the least. So far, he gets a B- from me overall and that's being generous. Really pretty disappointed. What's your grade? permalink award report block reply Deep_Croak 2 points 3 hours ago Deportations: Accelerating to fulll speed takes time. The Economy: Inflation down, Eggs -85%, Durable goods down Deep State Arrests: Patience grasshopper, the charges have to stick Election Integrity: They are building the case, we have time
I think the  H1B is a ruse, but could be wrong. Military recruiting at all time high! Solid A+ and expect him to kick it up a notch. permalink award report block reply
