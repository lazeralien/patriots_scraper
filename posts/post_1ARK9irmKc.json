Republicans aren't good by default, despite so many people believing what they're fed online. It's not that there are RINOs, it's that people don't want to actually pay attention to the republicans. They get mad when they don't act like their idealized version of them that they built through media manipulation and social media circle jerking.

You have to understand, it's so bad for so many people, that her plight is actually understandable and probably is the reason why they voted for her. There are more people between 20 and 40 now being supported by their parents because of how many jobs are being lost and how bad the economy is getting. Don't get mad that people are voting for Socialists. They don't have much of a choice otherwise. permalink award report block reply Snek_Plissken 3 points 2 days ago Washington is done for and nothing is going to change that. There might be a few changes if removing minority districting can be challenged. They basically took Seattle votes to cut from the extreme north and south. Cutting huge swathes from anyone that would potentially vote anything but the left. There isn't even a racial gerrymander there. It's just eliminate anything that isn't left. I don't know who is even voting for the fentanyl army, but hopefully they have good handwriting. permalink award report block reply Galahad175 3 points 2 days ago Wait til they figure out chief Seattle was a slave owner permalink award report block reply Easzq8 3 points 2 days ago \u201cWe count the votes until we get the correct outcome.\u201d permalink award report block reply hey_spike 2 points 2 days ago There have been socialists on the city council, so this is no surprise. permalink award report block reply DanIsSwell 2 points 2 days ago Annoying that the article never mentions her first name, keeps calling her \u201cWilson\u201d. permalink award report block reply KennyKetchem 1 points 2 days ago https://ballotpedia.org/Mayoral_election_in_Seattle , Washington (2025) Katie Wilson permalink parent award report block reply Porkchop-express 2 points 2 days ago I really feel like teaching communist and socialist classes in college is really hurting America permalink award report block reply SALTYinSeattle 2 points 2 days ago by an incredibly slim margin of 65 votes LMAO WUT?! \ud83e\udd23 permalink award report block reply thp2034 2 points 2 days ago In Seattle it may well be fraud. The Democrats have a very well oiled election machine in Washington and it hinges on all mail-in voting & the I-5 corridor from Vancouver in the south to Bellingham in the north. The Dems control the corridor and hence control the entire State. it sucks.... permalink award report block reply starjello 1 points 2 days ago Democrats got all major elections last Tuesday.

Consider doing this to every single registered member of the DSA. permalink award report block reply TerdBergler 1 points 2 days ago If only the right would be active instead of demanding the government, that serves the communist revolution, fix itself. I did see some stuff for people talking about getting into election monitoring and the like, but we've got to be more active. When the left and the government are working together against us, we can only rely on our side doing something. permalink award report block reply RockFlagAndEagle2020 1 points 1 day ago Boomers - don't get your panties all twisted.

You have to understand, it's so bad for so many people, that her plight is actually understandable and probably is the reason why they voted for her. There are more people between 20 and 40 now being supported by their parents because of how many jobs are being lost and how bad the economy is getting. Don't get mad that people are voting for Socialists. They don't have much of a choice otherwise. permalink award report block reply\nSnek_Plissken 3 points 2 days ago Washington is done for and nothing is going to change that. There might be a few changes if removing minority districting can be challenged. They basically took Seattle votes to cut from the extreme north and south. Cutting huge swathes from anyone that would potentially vote anything but the left. There isn't even a racial gerrymander there. It's just eliminate anything that isn't left. I don't know who is even voting for the fentanyl army, but hopefully they have good handwriting. permalink award report block reply\nGalahad175 3 points 2 days ago Wait til they figure out chief Seattle was a slave owner permalink award report block reply\nEaszq8 3 points 2 days ago \u201cWe count the votes until we get the correct outcome.\u201d permalink award report block reply\nhey_spike 2 points 2 days ago There have been socialists on the city council, so this is no surprise. permalink award report block reply\nDanIsSwell 2 points 2 days ago Annoying that the article never mentions her first name, keeps calling her \u201cWilson\u201d. permalink award report block reply KennyKetchem 1 points 2 days ago https://ballotpedia.org/Mayoral_election_in_Seattle , Washington (2025) Katie Wilson permalink parent award report block reply\nKennyKetchem 1 points 2 days ago https://ballotpedia.org/Mayoral_election_in_Seattle , Washington (2025) Katie Wilson permalink parent award report block reply\nPorkchop-express 2 points 2 days ago I really feel like teaching communist and socialist classes in college is really hurting America permalink award report block reply\nSALTYinSeattle 2 points 2 days ago by an incredibly slim margin of 65 votes LMAO WUT?! \ud83e\udd23 permalink award report block reply\nthp2034 2 points 2 days ago In Seattle it may well be fraud.
