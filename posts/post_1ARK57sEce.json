However, based on Elon's Rogan podcast, it seems that the real story is that DOGE caught the fraud that was funding the illegal alien invasion. Now all these democratic states are going bankrupt because they lost their gravy train but still need the money. So them asking for money for illegals directly as part of their demands, instead of using the old method of funneling the money is the only way these states aren't completely fucked.

We know they're going to do that shit no matter what whenever they get into power.  Trump could very well get impeached for real this time if we lose the midterms.  It's insane that we're at this point, but there's no returning things back to sanity when you have a voterbase that is bringing in more and more extreme candidates like Mamdani and Jay Jones.

They've already shown that they will rewrite morality, ethics, science, whatever the fuck they need to in order to justify doing what they believe is necessary to win.

Banning illegals from voting and harsh penalties who enable them or enter votes on their behalf.  It's already illegal, but put a finer point on it to shut up dems promoting it. Codifying into law that the cartels as international terrorist organizations would provide impeachment protections for Trump's actions so far in thwarting them. Restoring the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act, and increase penalties for violating it, whether you believe it's part of the problem or not, it draws attention to propaganda issues. Pass laws against media selectively or deceptively editing content that push a biased narrative vs. reporting. Pass laws requiring the media to clearly label their broadcasts as either option or news, laws that define each and establish penalties for violation. None of these are a guarantee, but if passed and the dems take the house they're going to be spinning their wheels trying to undo all of it rather than pushing their BS for a while. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

And even then, Democrats will sue to make sure they can still rig state elections, as well as do the insane redistricting bullshit. We can't afford to keep playing to a set of arbitrary rules that Democrats haven't been playing by to begin with.  You can't argue morality/ethics with those who will simply redefine those values should they get in power again. permalink award report block reply bearhugprolapse 6 points 4 days ago can i crack dat dawg? permalink award report block reply DingleBalls 5 points 4 days ago Crack that dog! permalink award report block reply bumpman 3 points 4 days ago The filibuster preferably should be ended, if not, there needs to be stronger rules written that the democrats can\u2019t end it next time they are in power. This needs to be settled, we can\u2019t trust democrats permalink award report block reply grad16uc 1 points 4 days ago Let them have it. If whatever they do is a catastrophe, they have to own it then. The filibuster serves literally one purpose for both parties - an excuse to not do anything. permalink parent award report block reply ReallyGayMods 3 points 4 days ago It seems like all of you are saying \"Nuke the filibuster, no more mail ballots, one day voting\" Mail in and voting month is all set by the states, not the federal government. So that won't work. And now dems would have the filibuster gone and once they take over, they have permanent rule Getting rid of the filibuster is a terrible idea permalink award report block reply thunderpussy 3 points 4 days ago Indeed. We don't really even have 50 votes on most issues currently, and believe me, there is at least a third of the Senate that hide behind Murkoski's, Collins, and Paul's, \"no\" votes. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 3 points 4 days ago And covers way more then the \"Good shit\" people want. The argument that the dems next win will tear down the fillibuster is an assumption; the reality that tearing down the fillibuster means people will be constantly getting fucked via see-saw however is a certainty. permalink parent award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 1 points 4 days ago Exactly this. It's been my main point in every argument about the filibuster. Sure, it locks down government on some issues, but it also helps ensure that neither side rams through a bunch of bullshit to fuck over the general populace. Without it, none of us would have guns right now. permalink parent award report block reply True_Curmudgeon 2 points 4 days ago This place isnt suitable for a constitutional republic anymore permalink award report block reply ShotgunParade69x 2 points 4 days ago Everyone contact your representative and DO THIS!!  It\u2019s really our last chance at moving things in the right direction - permalink award report block reply ckover9000 2 points 4 days ago I keep losing track of what side of the filibuster I'm supposed to be on. Since the GOP is actively opening the door to losing the House next year aren't we probably going to need it? I'm not counting on this clownass \"majority\" to get enough done to sit comfy. permalink award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 2 points 4 days ago That's been my take as well. permalink parent award report block reply BlackFolk 2 points 4 days ago DO IT ALREADY AND QUIT YAPPING ABOUT IT permalink award report block reply Light_HIV_Effect 2 points 4 days ago I don't know. Do you want to be powerless when democrats take back control of the senate? Of course, none of this would probably be happening now if the leadership in the senate actually supported the candidates from swing states that Trump won. We'd be looking at 58 seats, and I'm sure you could pick off one senator aside from Fetterneck. permalink award report block reply ReallyGayMods 2 points 4 days ago Terminating the filibuster is an awful idea permalink award report block reply TheJakeFroggy 2 points 4 days ago I will continue to scream it from the rooftops: If the Republicans just flat out refuse to work with Trump and enact his agenda, then at that point Trump will have literally no other choice but to invoke the Insurrection Act and get the military to perform a swift takedown of the corrupt people in government. He knows that option exists. He mentioned it in a few interviews last month and even said he'd be up to using it if he had to. And it's why I won't rule it out and believe there may very well be a chance that he uses it as a last resort. permalink award report block reply Ghostphaez 6 points 4 days ago Dude, stop living in fantasy land! Trump will never, ever do this. permalink parent award report block reply noPTSDforMePlease 2 points 4 days ago I.wonder if the filibuster termination is real, or just leverage to get what he wants out of the shut down. Probably a mix of both. permalink award report block reply MAGALADON9 2 points 4 days ago We don't have 51 votes though   \ud83d\ude22 permalink award report block reply MasterChief08 2 points 4 days ago ABOLISH THE FILLIBUSTER AND PACK THE COURTS permalink award report block reply 2008RonPaul2012 2 points 4 days ago If there is one things dogs are known for its how often they crack.

It's not a matter of figuring out how to do it, they simply don't want to do it. permalink award report block reply BidensPrisonWallet 2 points 4 days ago What position is Cruz/AIPAC Spokesman taking on this ? permalink award report block reply AlvinOfTheTrumpmunks 2 points 4 days ago Still need to deal with the RINOs in the senate. permalink award report block reply Justjayce 1 points 4 days ago Our RINOS will fuck it up even without the filibuster permalink award report block reply Forty_Five 1 points 4 days ago Too bad most of the republicans are losers. permalink award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 1 points 4 days ago If we pass national voter ID and abolish unsolicited mail-in ballots, the entire country will shit towards Republicans, because many Dems are only in power due to fraud. Republicans would get a majority so big throughout the country, we might even be able to pass constitutional amendments and fix some serious problems. permalink award report block reply Tacitus1963 1 points 4 days ago The problem with blowing up the filibuster is that the RINO party is almost as bad as their Demtard buds. They would continue to slow walk all of Trump's agenda. They don't like that he's back in office as it cuts into the status quo of laundering our tax dollars back to all of them. That's the inherent risk in the RINO party getting rid of it.\nThe Demtards will have no problem getting rid of it.\nLook at all the damage they did for 4 years after they stole the election with nary a peep from the RINOs. permalink award report block reply Drdonaldjtrump1776 1 points 4 days ago News flash, the Republicans are stupid permalink award report block reply Silentbutdeadly 1 points 3 days ago The Democrats would do it.  They would do ANYTHING they could think of to gain the advantage and wouldn\u2019t give a shit about the optics or of it hurt Republicans feelings. permalink award report block reply Beardholder 1 points 4 days ago Loser???

Explain to me how this works... permalink award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 1 points 4 days ago No. Getting rid of the filibuster only requires 51 votes. Getting rid of the \"cloture\" rule requires 60. permalink parent award report block reply mikejones 1 points 4 days ago Trump going to make it so voters have a say again. permalink award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 4 days ago Well...unless you voted for the other guys that won... permalink parent award report block reply possibletower 1 points 4 days ago Murkowski/Collins/Rand Paul will vote no to this though. Hopefully the other 50 GOP senators finally get their heads out of their asses and nuke the filibuster. They only need 50 plus the VP. permalink award report block reply astralentity 1 points 4 days ago This is the way. permalink award report block reply BlueKentuckyGirl 1 points 4 days ago It\u2019s about giving billions to insurance companies money without them competing in the marketplace.

The Republicans are telling us they are filibustering but they are actually just threatening to do so. permalink award report block reply SavingPrivateGrace 1 points 4 days ago Keep it shutdown.  The Republicans should sleep with these mad dogs for at least 30 days.  Hold the line.  No healthcare for illegals period. permalink award report block reply Snerdley 1 points 4 days ago Nuke the filibuster, then immediately pass voting reforms to prevent a democrat (cheating) surge. This HAS to be done just to get the voting reforms. If not, they will eventually cheat and surge and then THEY will nuke the filibuster. Its time has come. Kill it. permalink award report block reply SquirreleeDan 1 points 4 days ago Can anyone care about the class that\u2019s being completely fucked for the last 10 years for fucking once? permalink award report block reply canadianhere 1 points 4 days ago So what happened with that guy who said they were prepared to give the Democrats everything?

Right!? permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 2 points 3 days ago I mean its right up there with essentially insulating the US from the world markets by tossing up massive trade barriers - I mean US deficit on trade is almost 1 Trillion this year...so even if we use the optimistic number that's a 200 billion shortfall after tariffs - and that's only going to worsen. The thing is the government has a really bad habit of not being able to admit when its probably wrong - I don't think the solution is to make it impossible for it to walk back from when it fucks up. Trump isn't infallible and I hate that his solution to his inability to negotiate with the democrats is to simply cut them out of the process entirely - I assumed the US practices democracy but it really does seem more and more like Trump has no time for that. permalink parent award report block reply the_new_one 2 points 4 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink award report block reply TheDarkEmperor 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply TheGoyimWhisperer 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink award report block reply\nBeachboy1b 76 points 4 days ago They NEED to do that at this point.

However, based on Elon's Rogan podcast, it seems that the real story is that DOGE caught the fraud that was funding the illegal alien invasion. Now all these democratic states are going bankrupt because they lost their gravy train but still need the money. So them asking for money for illegals directly as part of their demands, instead of using the old method of funneling the money is the only way these states aren't completely fucked. Which means that the power is on our side, not on their side. permalink parent award report block reply Skogin 17 points 4 days ago They are ridiculously overextended, and the music has stopped. permalink parent award report block reply minttea2 5 points 4 days ago CNN: \"So I actually am not going to be a hack for the Democrats or the Republican right now.

The morality or being \"better\" argument is also dangerously ignorant in the wake of Charlie Kirk's public execution. We know they're going to do that shit no matter what whenever they get into power.  Trump could very well get impeached for real this time if we lose the midterms.  It's insane that we're at this point, but there's no returning things back to sanity when you have a voterbase that is bringing in more and more extreme candidates like Mamdani and Jay Jones. It's now or never to secure our Constitutional Republic.  Otherwise they will force their Multicultural Democracy upon us because they do not give a shit about ethics, morality, or anything of that sort.  History is written by the victors, and they know that full well.  They've already shown that they will rewrite morality, ethics, science, whatever the fuck they need to in order to justify doing what they believe is necessary to win.  And they are not above killing people to get their way, either.

Codifying into law that the cartels as international terrorist organizations would provide impeachment protections for Trump's actions so far in thwarting them. Restoring the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act, and increase penalties for violating it, whether you believe it's part of the problem or not, it draws attention to propaganda issues. Pass laws against media selectively or deceptively editing content that push a biased narrative vs. reporting. Pass laws requiring the media to clearly label their broadcasts as either option or news, laws that define each and establish penalties for violation. None of these are a guarantee, but if passed and the dems take the house they're going to be spinning their wheels trying to undo all of it rather than pushing their BS for a while. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...\nBuild_Back_Bankrupt 4 points 4 days ago I'm not so sure the country can handle more rounds of impeachment proceedings, and it might be what some of the RINO's want too.

Explain to me how this works... permalink award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 1 points 4 days ago No. Getting rid of the filibuster only requires 51 votes. Getting rid of the \"cloture\" rule requires 60. permalink parent award report block reply\nConfusedAngryArmed 1 points 4 days ago No. Getting rid of the filibuster only requires 51 votes.

Hopefully the other 50 GOP senators finally get their heads out of their asses and nuke the filibuster. They only need 50 plus the VP. permalink award report block reply\nastralentity 1 points 4 days ago This is the way. permalink award report block reply\nBlueKentuckyGirl 1 points 4 days ago It\u2019s about giving billions to insurance companies money without them competing in the marketplace.

It's not even the case that they are filibustering. The Republicans are telling us they are filibustering but they are actually just threatening to do so. permalink award report block reply\nSavingPrivateGrace 1 points 4 days ago Keep it shutdown.  The Republicans should sleep with these mad dogs for at least 30 days.  Hold the line.  No healthcare for illegals period. permalink award report block reply\nSnerdley 1 points 4 days ago Nuke the filibuster, then immediately pass voting reforms to prevent a democrat (cheating) surge. This HAS to be done just to get the voting reforms. If not, they will eventually cheat and surge and then THEY will nuke the filibuster. Its time has come. Kill it. permalink award report block reply\nSquirreleeDan 1 points 4 days ago Can anyone care about the class that\u2019s being completely fucked for the last 10 years for fucking once? permalink award report block reply\ncanadianhere 1 points 4 days ago So what happened with that guy who said they were prepared to give the Democrats everything?

Right!? permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 2 points 3 days ago I mean its right up there with essentially insulating the US from the world markets by tossing up massive trade barriers - I mean US deficit on trade is almost 1 Trillion this year...so even if we use the optimistic number that's a 200 billion shortfall after tariffs - and that's only going to worsen. The thing is the government has a really bad habit of not being able to admit when its probably wrong - I don't think the solution is to make it impossible for it to walk back from when it fucks up. Trump isn't infallible and I hate that his solution to his inability to negotiate with the democrats is to simply cut them out of the process entirely - I assumed the US practices democracy but it really does seem more and more like Trump has no time for that. permalink parent award report block reply\nKlaus73 2 points 4 days ago Aye - unimpeded government is a awesome idea! permalink parent award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 1 points 4 days ago What could possibly go wrong, right?
