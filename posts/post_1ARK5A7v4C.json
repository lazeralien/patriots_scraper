You would want to know a 1 hour 555 timer wasn't triggered and has been slowly draining the capacitor for the last 50 minutes. Here, the kitchen timer can be the better choice. An esties rocket igniter works for low explosives. but I rolled my own rocket igniters (for model rocketry) out of thru-hole resistors back in the day. Too bad ping-pong are no longer made of nitrocelulose. You would need a detonator for high explosives (ammonium nitrate, etc) nitric acid is cheaper to buy, but seems easy to make.
