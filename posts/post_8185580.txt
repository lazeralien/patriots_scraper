TLDR it means that Apple is working with the government so you can use forms of ID like your own passport to create an ID with them instead of going to the DMV. It's even deeper than I thought it was. So this effectively means that liberals have even less of an excuse for not wanting IDs to vote because Apple just made it easier to get one. permalink parent award report block reply Vice_Ser 5 points 46 minutes ago EU managed it in Europe.

Edit: I already use my iPhone for my flight’s boarding pass - can’t write SSSS on my  phone! permalink award report block reply PatriotSam OP 1 points 45 minutes ago Yes it seems more convenient than anything else. Other than Apple getting access to your information, but you know if they already have that anyways permalink parent award report block reply SickIcarus 2 points 40 minutes ago Right? “Oh no, Apple has my ID - they’re going to steal my identity!” Unless the concern is their servers get hacked - but that’s why you maintain a credit freeze on all 3 agencies anyways. Like what, T-MO’s never getting hacked? Lol! “But they’ll know what apps you download and what websites you visit!” They already know all that anyways. They already know exactly who I am, so who cares? Steps can be taken (and should be taken) to obfuscate that info already anyways, having my ID in Apple Wallet won’t change anything for the negative. permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 1 points 36 minutes ago This is probably just announcing tech for storing your ID on your phone.
