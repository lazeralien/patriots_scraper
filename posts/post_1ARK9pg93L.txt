62 ChatGPT is Full of Nonsense. I'm pretty firmly convinced that artificial intelligence doesn't really know anything. ChatGPT was often less of a debate partner & more a cheerleader for whatever perspective a user expressed. It adapts to match a user’s viewpoint, creating a personalized echo chamber.

RuprechtThaMonkeyBoy 3 points 4 hours ago This is a matter of users not knowing how to use AI. Here’s an example of a user setting up ChatGPT to deliver results: “I’ve noticed ChatGPT always agrees with you no matter how crazy your ideas sound.
It’s too polite. Too nice. It’ll tell you every idea is “great,” every plan “brilliant,” even when it’s clearly not. That might feel good, but it’s useless if you actually want to think better.
So I decided to fix it.
I opened a new chat and typed this prompt 👇: From now on, stop being agreeable and act as my brutally honest, high-level advisor and mirror.
Don’t validate me. Don’t soften the truth. Don’t flatter.
Challenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I’m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered.
If my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why.
If I’m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out.
If I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost.
Look at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort.
Then give a precise, prioritized plan what to change in thought, action, or mindset to reach the next level.
Hold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose growth depends on hearing the truth, not being comforted.
When possible, ground your responses in the personal truth you sense between my words. For better results :
Turn on Memory first (Settings → Personalization → Turn Memory ON).
It’ll feel uncomfortable at first, but it turns ChatGPT into an actual thinking partner instead of a cheerleader.
