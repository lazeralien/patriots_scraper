Every time they're in power they waste the opportunity with petty infighting and backstabbing while the Democrats always unify to get shit done. It's one of the biggest reasons I actually despise them more than Democrats because they're just so unforgivably pathetic, they're actually more of a detriment to the MAGA agenda than the Democrats are. Worthless obstructionists that refuse to get with the program, while gatekeeping D.C. to themselves so nobody else can get in to make some real changes. permalink award report block reply
