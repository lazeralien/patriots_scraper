Be respectful and do your duty. permalink parent award report block reply mikethemarine 4 points 5 hours ago I submitted my letter permalink parent award report block reply congruent 0 points 4 hours ago Dear long-time Trump supporters. Did you or did you not read Sun-Tzu's the art of war? Trump is playing the long game. One very real possibility: By saying \"yay H-1Bs\" Trump presents a target to his enemies. His divided base. N.B. a target of HIS OWN CHOOSING! Entirely possible, even probable, that he wants the country and his enemies focused on this issue while he continues to plan and scheme to make America great. And there are many, many other possibilities. Eg, making a deal with India which ends the threat China poses to the world. Eg 2, posturing that you're making a deal with India to make China play their trump card (no relation) before they're read. And many, many, many other scenarios that we probably can't even imagine. permalink parent award report block reply fallhollow 3 points 4 hours ago it will amount to nothing if we lose the midterms permalink parent award report block reply congruent 0 points 3 hours ago This could be part of winning the midterms. It's not like this issue and its fallout and corollaries is stuck in this one position now forever. It can and will change many times between now and Nov 2016. And not even clear if \"winning the midterms\" is that important. None of those elected officials have any power. They're just names on doors. If Trump has their donors cowed, doesn't matter who gets elected. permalink parent award report block reply Drekken- 2 points 4 hours ago Stop it. He's the best President of our lifetime but let's not pretend he doesn't get bad advice and runs with it. The Chinese students and H1B comments were devistating to anyone that has supported him. I thought he knew his base better. I'll give him the benefit of a doubt but don't pretend like this isnt a huge fuck up. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 2 hours ago If Trump were to solve a trillion dollar trade deficit and shore up the USD remaining as the global reserve currency by accepting a few hundred F-1 Chinese students, that would be an incredibly good deal.  The GOP loses perpetually because they are idealist and purists. Trump is neither. That is why, for the first time since the New Deal, we are turning the ship around.  Stay the course. Trump's worst deal is 100 times better than Kamala or Jeb. permalink parent award report block reply Drekken- 2 points 1 hour ago I'm in it to win it.

I'm sure I'll get hate, but you are right. permalink parent award report block reply congruent 1 points 3 hours ago It's a strategic decision from the most strategically gifted president in 50 years, maybe the entire nation's history. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 2 hours ago \ud83d\udc46 permalink parent award report block reply PepeWashington OP 57 points 7 hours ago Please be civil.

This forum is full of uncivilized racist people. White Americans need to stop whining about stolen jobs and work harder. Maybe if you get properly educated and work hard, you can join the workforce. In good old fashioned capitalism style. Funny how the group that rails against govt handouts wants the govt to handout jobs despite being lesser qualified. permalink parent award report block reply PMSocks 40 points 5 hours ago Trump needs a rally so we can boo him like we did for the vax permalink award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 22 points 5 hours ago Not gonna happen anytime soon.

Indians are ashamed to be \u201cyou guys\u201d. I would rather die than be white. My culture is superior and you can choose to assimilate into superior merit, or fuck off back to Europe. \u201cActual MAGA\u201d seems to believe that the group that\u2019s supporting the dead US economy is somehow bad. Yeah. Make your country great again by throwing out the only productive people.

CrossTheRubixCube 38 points 6 hours ago Sending now. Will be civil. permalink award report block reply Lol_Garrus 26 points 5 hours ago America is a country, not an economic zone. We are supposed to be a peoples of shared heritage, values, and beliefs. Not worker bees to be used as needed and disgarded when something cheaper comes along. permalink award report block reply Repentnow 6 points 5 hours ago That requires free market. Our current Neomercantilist system is a distorted departure from our nation's free market capitalism. permalink parent award report block reply anishr -2 points 48 minutes ago Your ancestors did not follow any of those principles by assimilating into the host country Most Indians and H1Bs actually do assimilate pretty well despite the fact that the host country\u2019s culture is non-existent/worse. Despite assimilating and contributing way more than whites (double the average median household income), they still get looked down upon. permalink parent award report block reply Lol_Garrus 5 points 44 minutes ago okay, Pajeet. permalink parent award report block reply anishr -3 points 42 minutes ago Thanks. You just used an honorific that\u2019s higher than \u201csir\u201d. That just goes to show how retarded/illiterate you guys are. permalink parent award report block reply Grindelwald 18 points 7 hours ago Ok. Dear Mr. President.  I do not like foreigners taking jobs that Americans can do.  I do not like companies in America hiring cheap labor. But, since our educational system has been so bad for so long and we have an urgency for expertise, please limit it for temporary talent. Then fix the G*$ Damn schools and build talent here at home. permalink award report block reply auntjemima 26 points 5 hours ago I remember when lack of talent drove salaries up and led to college graduates migrating to said jobs to meet the demand.  Doesn't work that way with H1B's flooding the talent pool. permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 15 points 5 hours ago Yeah but now we have endless pajeets with fake degrees who think you're so fucking stupid for letting them get away with it. Haha only I redeem now!!! permalink parent award report block reply SpellingContable 9 points 4 hours ago There are 4 Jeets for every American, and also 4 Chinamen for every American.

Updooted permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 5 points 4 hours ago It\u2019s just a full on lie. Almost every business that starts hires someone off the street and they figure it out as they go along. Go drag boomers out of retirement and have them teach. Saying we don\u2019t know how to ship build while having the best navy is farcical. permalink parent award report block reply Grindelwald 4 points 4 hours ago Boomers for the win permalink parent award report block reply Parabellum76 12 points 5 hours ago Guys I\u2019m utterly demoralized with this administration, it seems Trump has completely turned his back on his base and surrounded himself the Neocons and deep state elites. permalink award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 10 points 5 hours ago A lot of things changed when Charlie was murdered. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 4 points 4 hours ago That seemed to be the turning point...and not the right one. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 4 hours ago That's BS.

He apparently thinks Americans don't have \"talent\".  What a patriotic thing to say. permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments... Repentnow 10 points 5 hours ago My President, Please reconsider your stance on H-1B visas. These are not being issued for highly skilled personnel.  I understand that you might be using immigration as a leverage position with India (H-1B visas) and China (F-1 visas), but if that is the case, please be transparent with your base. MAGA wants as close to zero immigration as possible.  This is non-negotiable to your MAGA base. The midterms will be a disaster if you ignore immigration. Respectfully, your most loyal constituent. permalink award report block reply Awan-CIA-Car-Lot 5 points 4 hours ago Excellent message \ud83d\udc4d permalink parent award report block reply Justjayce 2 points 11 minutes ago I steals.. Thank you permalink parent award report block reply anishr -4 points 46 minutes ago Just because you think they\u2019re not highly skilled, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t. That\u2019s not how capitalism works. I guess you guys just cannot fathom why other cultures like Indians are superior in many ways to your \u201cculture\u201d. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 2 points 38 minutes ago Then please, by all means go back to your superior culture and stfu. We literally hate you. permalink parent award report block reply NamendaBiden 8 points 5 hours ago Message sent.  Piece of cake.  EVERYONE needs to do this asap. permalink award report block reply rezimx 7 points 4 hours ago H1B is the dumbest shit ever.  There are Americans with tech skill sets that cant get jobs because they are being undercut by cheap foreign labor.  Tie the number of H1Bs to the number of US citizens in each field looking for work.  Lots of citizens = no H1Bs. permalink award report block reply Eyepatch_McCain 7 points 5 hours ago I'm a lot more concerned with offshoring right now. permalink award report block reply bejeavis 2 points 4 hours ago Two sides of the same coin permalink parent award report block reply mytummyhurts 6 points 5 hours ago I'm doing my part! permalink award report block reply h3xAd3c1m4L 6 points 5 hours ago \u201cLack of US based talent\u201d my ass. permalink award report block reply UncleTrumpsBand 5 points 5 hours ago I did my part!! permalink award report block reply tarballs 5 points 5 hours ago Wrote a few paragraphs and copied them to the vice president as well. permalink award report block reply NYRepublican72 5 points 4 hours ago Done.

They say get a physics degree, we have a severe shortage.  Yet the university is making deals with industry to place their F1/OPT intl students and ignoring domestic.  Going to industry for jobs,  even with professor's inside contacts, will just teach you about H1B.  Get around that, you still have to overcome DEI hiring policies. permalink award report block reply MkultraUSA 3 points 4 hours ago I did it pede!

Life isn't the internet, retard. Go outside. permalink award report block reply Danofdestiny 3 points 5 hours ago Done. permalink award report block reply call-it-like-i-sees 3 points 5 hours ago done - I wrote his words back to him.  Let's see what Trump and Noem do with this. permalink award report block reply Tacitus1963 2 points 1 hour ago I just sent a lengthy comment using this WH site. permalink award report block reply barwhack 2 points 5 hours ago Do it. He'll Epstard, but do it anyway. Maybe God will bloody give FURTHER weight to the words. permalink award report block reply BTWiuseArch25 2 points 5 hours ago OP I would recommend that you add \"in a civil manor\" to your title. permalink award report block reply TheJakeFroggy 2 points 4 hours ago For a bit of nuance, I remember when Trump used to push for the covid vaccines, and then eventually stopped doing that after he was booed in a rally about it. I even heard that someone directly confronted him about the covid vaccines and told him the truth about it, and it horrified him. Which shows that he has listened to his base before, theoretically we'd just have to do the same about the Chinese student issues and the H-1B issue. permalink award report block reply ILoveSilk 1 points 2 hours ago Can you write a template for us? permalink award report block reply redditadminssuckit 1 points 5 hours ago This is a good post. I'm tired of the whining here on this forum and the complete lack of gratitude for the things Trump has accomplished. He's not perfect and he's going to make mistakes, but he's the closest thing to a perfect president that you will ever see in your life. So, if you have something critical to say, have some fucking balls and say it to him directly on the White House website. This site is not intended to be a non-stop doomer whine fest about every Trump misstep permalink award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 8 points 5 hours ago It's a free country, dude. We can complain wherever we want, especially when we feel betrayed. That being said, this is a way we can (hopefully) get our message through to him. permalink parent award report block reply redditadminssuckit 5 points 5 hours ago Understood but that's not what I'm seeing here. People are basically saying that Trump played us, they're not just saying he's making a mistake or he shouldn't be doing this or that. They're basically completely turning on him and those are the kind of posts I'm talking about. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 2 points 5 hours ago I understand that Doomerism won't solve anything. But some people will call some of us antisemites for questioning why we're giving funds to Israel. People will call us liars when we point out that groceries are still expensive (and have increased in price), all because Trump said that they're more affordable in a tweet. He's done so well in many cases, but has fumbled so much that it's become difficult for many of us not to feel like he's played us. I don't think he has; we're asking one man to basically become a dictator for many of the things we're asking for, and what he's up against. The problem is that this place is so high-energy and intense that if Trump doesn't give us 100% what we want, he's compromised. Or, if he says something that we point out is against what his initial beliefs and promises were, we get the response, \"Are you against Trump? Cry more, faggot.\" permalink parent award report block reply redditadminssuckit 3 points 5 hours ago You're forgetting he's only been in office actually working for about 9 months. You're forgetting the pardoning of the January 6th defendants, the appointment of headsseth and the purging of our military, the elimination of a variety of money laundering and wasteful agencies with the help of musk, the elimination of the Department of education, the pulling of funding from transgender ideology universities essentially reversing that trend. You've completely forgotten the influence he has had on private Industry and eliminating their DEI programs, I can go on and on and on. Jesus people support our president or get the hell off of this website. A complaining is fine but acting as though he's failing us overall is just wrong permalink parent award report block reply NebraskanPatriot 0 points 4 hours ago He knows how you feel.  But, he already tricked you out of your vote, so you've been discarded.  Back to the Globalist Agenda, folks. permalink parent award report block reply aphoticamy 4 points 5 hours ago LOVE this post. Sent a respectful, short and to the point message. This post needs to be stickied and if not re-posted daily.

Try again retard. He's done nothing to work with congress to fix our immigration system. He's brought no charges against these people in a meaningful way. He has not gone after any of the employers employing these illegals. I'd rather see the CEO of tyson foods perp walked , charged and convicted then some random ass beaners pulled off the streets giving democrats good PR. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 1 points 4 hours ago What gives you the idea that congress is interested in fixing it? permalink parent award report block reply berserkerbarrage -2 points 5 hours ago Lol. H-1B has existed for over 35 years, and Trump has made it more difficult and expensive to abuse than ever before. Now he's \"one of the worst\" because he doesn't believe that we should take random, uneducated blacks off the unemployment line and have them start building missiles and car batteries. permalink parent award report block reply RockFlagAndEagle2020 4 points 5 hours ago I would shut the program down. Fuck you permalink parent award report block reply berserkerbarrage -1 points 5 hours ago No, you wouldn't, because you wouldn't have the authority. H-1B was created and can only be ended by Congress, and Trump is already being sued over the restrictions that he has implemented. permalink parent award report block reply try4gain PRO -2 points 4 hours ago the crashing out and crying all over social media is unreal today.  trump has always said 1 dumb thing per month then walked it back later. ffs are people literally brand new permalink award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste -2 points 5 hours ago Be careful, might put you on a list.

Be respectful and do your duty. permalink parent award report block reply\nmikethemarine 4 points 5 hours ago I submitted my letter permalink parent award report block reply\ncongruent 0 points 4 hours ago Dear long-time Trump supporters. Did you or did you not read Sun-Tzu's the art of war? Trump is playing the long game. One very real possibility: By saying \"yay H-1Bs\" Trump presents a target to his enemies. His divided base. N.B. a target of HIS OWN CHOOSING! Entirely possible, even probable, that he wants the country and his enemies focused on this issue while he continues to plan and scheme to make America great. And there are many, many other possibilities. Eg, making a deal with India which ends the threat China poses to the world. Eg 2, posturing that you're making a deal with India to make China play their trump card (no relation) before they're read. And many, many, many other scenarios that we probably can't even imagine. permalink parent award report block reply fallhollow 3 points 4 hours ago it will amount to nothing if we lose the midterms permalink parent award report block reply congruent 0 points 3 hours ago This could be part of winning the midterms.

He's the best President of our lifetime but let's not pretend he doesn't get bad advice and runs with it. The Chinese students and H1B comments were devistating to anyone that has supported him.

Lots of citizens = no H1Bs. permalink award report block reply\nEyepatch_McCain 7 points 5 hours ago I'm a lot more concerned with offshoring right now. permalink award report block reply bejeavis 2 points 4 hours ago Two sides of the same coin permalink parent award report block reply\nbejeavis 2 points 4 hours ago Two sides of the same coin permalink parent award report block reply\nmytummyhurts 6 points 5 hours ago I'm doing my part! permalink award report block reply\nh3xAd3c1m4L 6 points 5 hours ago \u201cLack of US based talent\u201d my ass. permalink award report block reply\nUncleTrumpsBand 5 points 5 hours ago I did my part!! permalink award report block reply\ntarballs 5 points 5 hours ago Wrote a few paragraphs and copied them to the vice president as well. permalink award report block reply\nNYRepublican72 5 points 4 hours ago Done.

They say get a physics degree, we have a severe shortage.  Yet the university is making deals with industry to place their F1/OPT intl students and ignoring domestic.  Going to industry for jobs,  even with professor's inside contacts, will just teach you about H1B.  Get around that, you still have to overcome DEI hiring policies. permalink award report block reply\nMkultraUSA 3 points 4 hours ago I did it pede!

I even heard that someone directly confronted him about the covid vaccines and told him the truth about it, and it horrified him. Which shows that he has listened to his base before, theoretically we'd just have to do the same about the Chinese student issues and the H-1B issue. permalink award report block reply\nILoveSilk 1 points 2 hours ago Can you write a template for us? permalink award report block reply\nredditadminssuckit 1 points 5 hours ago This is a good post. I'm tired of the whining here on this forum and the complete lack of gratitude for the things Trump has accomplished. He's not perfect and he's going to make mistakes, but he's the closest thing to a perfect president that you will ever see in your life. So, if you have something critical to say, have some fucking balls and say it to him directly on the White House website. This site is not intended to be a non-stop doomer whine fest about every Trump misstep permalink award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 8 points 5 hours ago It's a free country, dude. We can complain wherever we want, especially when we feel betrayed. That being said, this is a way we can (hopefully) get our message through to him. permalink parent award report block reply redditadminssuckit 5 points 5 hours ago Understood but that's not what I'm seeing here. People are basically saying that Trump played us, they're not just saying he's making a mistake or he shouldn't be doing this or that. They're basically completely turning on him and those are the kind of posts I'm talking about. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 2 points 5 hours ago I understand that Doomerism won't solve anything. But some people will call some of us antisemites for questioning why we're giving funds to Israel. People will call us liars when we point out that groceries are still expensive (and have increased in price), all because Trump said that they're more affordable in a tweet. He's done so well in many cases, but has fumbled so much that it's become difficult for many of us not to feel like he's played us. I don't think he has; we're asking one man to basically become a dictator for many of the things we're asking for, and what he's up against. The problem is that this place is so high-energy and intense that if Trump doesn't give us 100% what we want, he's compromised. Or, if he says something that we point out is against what his initial beliefs and promises were, we get the response, \"Are you against Trump? Cry more, faggot.\" permalink parent award report block reply redditadminssuckit 3 points 5 hours ago You're forgetting he's only been in office actually working for about 9 months. You're forgetting the pardoning of the January 6th defendants, the appointment of headsseth and the purging of our military, the elimination of a variety of money laundering and wasteful agencies with the help of musk, the elimination of the Department of education, the pulling of funding from transgender ideology universities essentially reversing that trend. You've completely forgotten the influence he has had on private Industry and eliminating their DEI programs, I can go on and on and on. Jesus people support our president or get the hell off of this website. A complaining is fine but acting as though he's failing us overall is just wrong permalink parent award report block reply NebraskanPatriot 0 points 4 hours ago He knows how you feel.
