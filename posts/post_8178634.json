Best case it's workable for the small fraction of men capable of being the patriarch of multiple whole families (as in separate households). It may also be workable for the small fraction of women who can handle a second matriarch in the home. And at a societal level it can only work when there's an excess of single women. permalink parent award report block reply Floppybutthole 3 points 3 days ago Agreed polygamy can only work if men died at twice the rate of women.  Even then, most tribes the woman would be married to her brother in law and the original wife had clear social power in the family unit and the new wife was thankful for her children getting fed. Of course the chances of one wife killing the child of the other increases significantly.    And having a society based around men dying all the time doesn't often advance beyond hunting and gathering. And when it does it quickly collapses or adopts a monogamous culture.  Or.... when it does become more successful, like Islam it gets pretty retarded because the average man is marrying his ugly cousin and the rich guys have 100 wives.   And men there still die like crazy. Either way you gotta ask yourself do you want to live in a western society or do you want to stick your dick in 100 women? Personally,  I'm not to fond of most western women.  But I'm not to fond of the current western culture either so... permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B 1 points 3 days ago the rich guys have 100 wives Yeah but the Biblical guidelines for divorce are very clear that there are almost no times it is allowable... one of the only exceptions is when the woman is not getting enough food, clothing, and sex.  So that limits even wealthy men who don't have time for tending to each wife. permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B -4 points 3 days ago Churches are full of excess single women pining away for a marriage. It isn't about the overall gender populations of the nation, it's about the overall populations of grounded responsible men v. excess women. permalink parent award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 6 points 3 days ago By \"excess single women\" i mean not picky women but rather women for who couldn't find a single man even if she lowered her standards and took whoever was willing to wife her up. permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B -2 points 3 days ago I understand that, but it's already happening.  There are way, way more women who want to be married in a stable relationship then men who feel the same way. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Reassess_Reevaluate 3 points 3 days ago Churches are full of women over the age of 30 who had their hoe phase and are looking for a boring nice guy to settle for since Chad Thunderstoke Poundermuffin the 3rd wouldn't commit to her. Then they suddenly \"Find Jayyysus\" so they won't be alone. If they show up at the door of the church for the first time after the age of 30, single, or even worse, single mom, then you better inspect her past with an electron microscope before you make any commitments. If she puts you off or says stuff like, \"body count doesn't matter, cause I've been born again!\"  Then good luck to you my brother in Christ. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 2 points 3 days ago Are you mormon? permalink parent award report block reply load 7 more comments... hillaryforprison 3 points 3 days ago That's so hot right now permalink award report block reply KeepingAmericaGreat 3 points 3 days ago Creepy meme permalink award report block reply The_Emperor 3 points 3 days ago Creepy?  Mayhaps you read too much into it?  Girls like stable providers of resources as potential mates, to ensure a future for their kids.  Tale old as time, and I thought the meme a bit clever, given the times. permalink parent award report block reply OGTsince1992 3 points 3 days ago I think it is creepy as well, and not because of the message. It\u2019s the fact that those girls look about 14 years old. permalink parent award report block reply KeepingAmericaGreat 2 points 3 days ago Exactly. permalink parent award report block reply Mungo 3 points 3 days ago In cash! permalink award report block reply Pied-Trumper 3 points 3 days ago These meme makes me realize how old we all are.

If he had a large homestead, knew how to build cabins, was a master craftsman with furniture, grew his own produce, had plenty of livestock, had a large arsenal of guns (that avoided boat accidents) for hunting game, and kept the household supplied with fish and fresh seafood (having a boat would be great, too), then, yes, please give me his satellite phone number. \ud83d\ude1c permalink award report block reply bicentennial_john 1 points 3 days ago Any other requirements? permalink parent award report block reply walls4america 1 points 2 days ago I\u2019ll have to watch some more homesteading shows and see if I can think of anything else. \ud83e\udd23 Until age 6 we lived on a farm in the South, so the homesteading shows with the flocks of chickens and home gardens and canning make me nostalgic. Then on RAV this weekend Ted Nugent was showing off results of his latest hunting, boasting of saving grocery money on meats. Despite my ability to cook all sorts of international meals from scratch and make bread, pasta, desserts, etc. (even biscuits & bacon gravy!!) from scratch, there\u2019s another level to being self-sufficient in raising one\u2019s own food. So in contrast with the meme, my thought was, why be 100% dependent on food from the store if most can be raised at home? permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B 1 points 3 days ago Hmmm.

It isn't about the overall gender populations of the nation, it's about the overall populations of grounded responsible men v. excess women. permalink parent award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 6 points 3 days ago By \"excess single women\" i mean not picky women but rather women for who couldn't find a single man even if she lowered her standards and took whoever was willing to wife her up. permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B -2 points 3 days ago I understand that, but it's already happening.  There are way, way more women who want to be married in a stable relationship then men who feel the same way. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Reassess_Reevaluate 3 points 3 days ago Churches are full of women over the age of 30 who had their hoe phase and are looking for a boring nice guy to settle for since Chad Thunderstoke Poundermuffin the 3rd wouldn't commit to her. Then they suddenly \"Find Jayyysus\" so they won't be alone. If they show up at the door of the church for the first time after the age of 30, single, or even worse, single mom, then you better inspect her past with an electron microscope before you make any commitments. If she puts you off or says stuff like, \"body count doesn't matter, cause I've been born again!\"  Then good luck to you my brother in Christ. permalink parent award report block reply\nFloppybutthole 3 points 3 days ago Agreed polygamy can only work if men died at twice the rate of women.  Even then, most tribes the woman would be married to her brother in law and the original wife had clear social power in the family unit and the new wife was thankful for her children getting fed. Of course the chances of one wife killing the child of the other increases significantly.    And having a society based around men dying all the time doesn't often advance beyond hunting and gathering. And when it does it quickly collapses or adopts a monogamous culture.  Or.... when it does become more successful, like Islam it gets pretty retarded because the average man is marrying his ugly cousin and the rich guys have 100 wives.   And men there still die like crazy. Either way you gotta ask yourself do you want to live in a western society or do you want to stick your dick in 100 women? Personally,  I'm not to fond of most western women.  But I'm not to fond of the current western culture either so... permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B 1 points 3 days ago the rich guys have 100 wives Yeah but the Biblical guidelines for divorce are very clear that there are almost no times it is allowable... one of the only exceptions is when the woman is not getting enough food, clothing, and sex.  So that limits even wealthy men who don't have time for tending to each wife. permalink parent award report block reply\nFriendly_B 1 points 3 days ago the rich guys have 100 wives Yeah but the Biblical guidelines for divorce are very clear that there are almost no times it is allowable... one of the only exceptions is when the woman is not getting enough food, clothing, and sex.
