I mean between 40 to 50 years the difference in monthly payments would be like $50, except you'd pay another half a million on the loan. A 50 year loan means you take out a $500,000 mortgage and end up paying like 4 million+. All this would do is make our country even more indebted to the banks than they already are and it'd take you 20 years before you saw any real equity gains on your home. Even a 35 year mortgage is bad. The solution isn't just longer loans. The solution is higher wages and more demand in our country. You know what would REALLY help drive prices of housing down a bit though? If the rental market wasn't so strong because we were importing 10 million people a year that needed to be housed. Imagine if the US kicked out 30 million illegal aliens from our country and all that housing opened up. Maybe then there wouldn't be so much pressure on housing. permalink award report block reply starjello -5 points 4 days ago The electoral asskicking last Tuesday is making Trump start to look desperate. Down vote away cultist zombies.\nNovember 7, 2025\nElection Results Show The Left Getting Away With Murder\nBy Jared Kardon There are many conclusions to be drawn from resounding Democrat victories in Tuesday\u2019s elections, but perhaps none is sadder than this: the left suffered little blowback from the assassination of Charlie Kirk. In the aftermath of Kirk\u2019s killing, there was a sense that it could be a momentous event in U.S. history, and a wake-up call for the right and the country as a whole. Not only had extreme anti-conservative rhetoric culminated in the murder of arguably the GOP\u2019s brightest young star, but platforms like Bluesky and Reddit showcased the left immediately reveling in the gruesome shooting of an innocent man. permalink parent award report block reply GeneticsGuy 5 points 4 days ago Uh, you mean the Democrat  strongholds that 95% of the time vote Democrat?
