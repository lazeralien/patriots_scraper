That incident is the one that comes up the most when trying to search for it.  News reports say the teens tried to rob the homeowner in the front yard, but the video clearly shows them breaking down a door.  The video also shows a condo or apartment in Neptune Beach, Florida while that article is from Georgia in a city near Atlanta.  None of the news articles specify 28 bullets were found in the autopsy reports. The video is likely clickbait garbage.  No real details are provided, like the names of the "accused" or the victims.  If there was a trial, they could easily provide the homeowner's name.  The mixed footage doesn't align with news reports, and seems to be of several different incidents. After doing more research, I found two other videos that use the same exact audio clip as the opening line in this video, but the woman is different in each.  That part of the video is likely AI-generated.  I attempted to use the name provided in one of the videos to validate the story, and came up with nothing. https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQ6oF-MDrMg/ https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQ7RDUmjCn6/ u/KuzoKevin the video is fake garbage.

That event happened at 4am in the front lawn of the house.  No one broke through a door at 3pm in the event you are referencing. I can't find anything that lines up with what is in this TikTok video, so I think it's just random events thrown together into a fake video to create outrage and clicks, and part of the sourcing for it is the underlying story from the event you have referenced, but only parts of it (the homeowner being sued in 2025 for it specifically). permalink parent award report block reply MinnieWhittaker 9 points 1 day ago Ah, so the criminals brought at least one gun?

Stand Your Ground law is used as such a fear-mongering thing.  It only applies to person who are lawfully present in a public place. These armed individual broke into someone's home.

The door was locked. They didn't like that. So, they kicked the door in. Not satisfied with just breaking the door, they entered. Once you break the plane of the threshold it's on you to figure out if it's worth your life. Obviously, they thought it was. Not expecting resistance they charged in, 3 teens on 1 old man. I would say they deserved anything that came their way. Remember, the old man wasn't at their house. The old man wasn't trying to break their door. The old man wasn't entering their home. He was on his property, in his home and the he didn't invite them in. The door was shut and locked. Clearly, he wanted to be left alone ,but here he is. Now, he will have to battle in court for the sole reason that he is not the same color as the intruders. permalink award report block reply Blackmore 1 points 18 hours ago Still stands>>Do the crime, pay the fine…. permalink award report block reply Judgejude 1 points 21 hours ago The breaking and entering trespassers were actively threatening his life and received a valid response- Which was defense of his home and property and life. He had every right to defend himself against Armed robbery. permalink award report block reply cardinaldrones 1 points 17 hours ago We need some white ptsd trigger happy veterans spaced out in the hood for population control.  Like dropping a cat into a rat infested house.  Get enough veterans on one street and they can start flipping the neighborhood white.  The home appreciation also would make them millionaires.  I’ve seen burned down houses in a white area sell for way  more than a similar house in a black area.  Which means your house burning down isn’t the end of the world.  But there’s no recovering from demographic change. permalink award report block reply RudeFrog 1 points 10 hours ago It's disgusting that any court would even humor such a case. permalink award report block reply Blackmore 1 points 19 hours ago When you decide to break into another man’s home to kill him, what did you expect to happen if you got stupid and shot? permalink award report block reply Moose_Antlers 1 points 16 hours ago Stupid woman should have been a decent mother. She wasn't, and a veteran had to clean up her mess. permalink award report block reply yowieman 1 points 16 hours ago The real crime is charging the guy for murder when its an obvious  case of self-defense.

You do what you have to do, until it is over. This is a false choice they want us to make.

brassmule 7 points 24 hours ago The video is AI BS.   Stand Your Ground law is used as such a fear-mongering thing.  It only applies to person who are lawfully present in a public place. These armed individual broke into someone's home.  Once you cross that threshold, in literally any state in the US, then you are forfeited your life, particularly if you are armed or have a disparity of force (1 old guy vs 3 young individuals). These criminals got what they deserved. permalink award report block reply

Counterwhat 2 points 24 hours ago They came calling to his house. The door was locked. They didn't like that. So, they kicked the door in. Not satisfied with just breaking the door, they entered. Once you break the plane of the threshold it's on you to figure out if it's worth your life. Obviously, they thought it was. Not expecting resistance they charged in, 3 teens on 1 old man. I would say they deserved anything that came their way. Remember, the old man wasn't at their house. The old man wasn't trying to break their door. The old man wasn't entering their home. He was on his property, in his home and the he didn't invite them in. The door was shut and locked. Clearly, he wanted to be left alone ,but here he is. Now, he will have to battle in court for the sole reason that he is not the same color as the intruders. permalink award report block reply

Judgejude 1 points 21 hours ago The breaking and entering trespassers were actively threatening his life and received a valid response- Which was defense of his home and property and life. He had every right to defend himself against Armed robbery. permalink award report block reply
cardinaldrones 1 points 17 hours ago We need some white ptsd trigger happy veterans spaced out in the hood for population control.  Like dropping a cat into a rat infested house.  Get enough veterans on one street and they can start flipping the neighborhood white.  The home appreciation also would make them millionaires.  I’ve seen burned down houses in a white area sell for way  more than a similar house in a black area.  Which means your house burning down isn’t the end of the world.  But there’s no recovering from demographic change. permalink award report block reply
