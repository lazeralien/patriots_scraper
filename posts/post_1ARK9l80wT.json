Not sure the best way to go about it, but banning corporate firms from buying out of state properties is probably a good start. This is especially important for \"poorer\" or lower cost of living states, when rich out of state corps can buy up everything for basically pennies (from their POV, what were reasonable/affordable prices from the people of that state's POV) and jacking them up to the ridiculous norms back in their super high COL states. There's a reason most countries ban foreign interests from buying up real estate.
