They prefer people who are coachable in new methods and can pay them LESS permalink award report block reply DeePlorable 3 points 2 days ago You are right. I once took a part time job as a cashier in a big box store to make a little mad money because I was a housewife. They fired all the 40-50+ something year old experienced store managers across my region. Then they hired all young 20 something year olds fresh out of college to be the new managers in all the local chains. Some of the old, loyal managers they tossed out were great and had over 25+ year store managerial experience and the stores were clean, stocked right and well run. I knew they did that so they could pay half the salary to make more profit. I was in my late 40s at the time. The new 23 year old store manager took me on the side and said \"Not to be ageist, but if I had a choice I would only hire 18-20 year olds with no prior work experience because they can be molded into what we want them to be\". I was taken aback as she also retorted that people my age or older were set in their ways and could not be taught to drink the corporate cool aid. She then told me if I weren't already hired she would have never hired me. All my co-workers were lazy kids who every other day would call out sick and they would hide and vape weed in the back all day while I did the work of 3 people, but was not appreciated. I quit and the store went to shit. The Yelp reviews after the newbies and young kids were running the stores were all 1 star complaints about rudeness, lack of customer service, dirty stores, no stock on the shelves, etc. permalink parent award report block reply frothy 1 points 2 days ago Came here to say similar.  If he had just changed the name and the experience up / down a year, then he'd have better proof of his claim. But changing 20 years to 5 years... 5 years = They see someone they can mold and will be a go getter, and will stick around. 20 years experience = Someone typically ingrained in their ways, probably looking towards retirement in 5 - 10 years. The company doesn't want to invest in someone that's going to be out the door sooner and / or someone that just does just above the minimal amount of work because they are 'over' working, just cruising to retirement. permalink parent award report block reply JimmyRussler 8 points 2 days ago Its been shit since they took the cocaine out of it anyway. permalink award report block reply NoMaskNoMaster 8 points 2 days ago They only buy grape drank A subsidiary of DOW chemical permalink award report block reply TiggerLovingPooh 7 points 2 days ago Cocer-Coler These racists deserve that hard R. permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey 7 points 2 days ago DaShawn \ud83e\udd8d permalink award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 7 points 2 days ago Every job application I submit is as Hispanic. permalink award report block reply DeePlorable 2 points 2 days ago My best friend checked off African American on her high school valedictorian son's college application and they offered him a $12,000 scholarship. She figured since her Italian grandfather was born in Africa and immigrated up to Italy, before coming to the USA, it's not lying. When they met him and saw he was pasty white, suddenly they did not have enough money in the \"budget\" and rescinded. She called them out and said they were racists and suddenly they found $2,000 they could afford to get from their \"budget\". permalink parent award report block reply Redeemable 1 points 2 days ago Do you have Hispanic heritage? permalink parent award report block reply worldowedexplanation 8 points 2 days ago If men can be women then we\u2019re all Indigenous BIPOC whatever the fucks now permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 8 points 2 days ago My grandmother's German birth certificate says she was born in Cuba to parents that were in the German Army in 1942.

They prefer people who are coachable in new methods and can pay them LESS permalink award report block reply DeePlorable 3 points 2 days ago You are right. I once took a part time job as a cashier in a big box store to make a little mad money because I was a housewife. They fired all the 40-50+ something year old experienced store managers across my region. Then they hired all young 20 something year olds fresh out of college to be the new managers in all the local chains. Some of the old, loyal managers they tossed out were great and had over 25+ year store managerial experience and the stores were clean, stocked right and well run. I knew they did that so they could pay half the salary to make more profit. I was in my late 40s at the time. The new 23 year old store manager took me on the side and said \"Not to be ageist, but if I had a choice I would only hire 18-20 year olds with no prior work experience because they can be molded into what we want them to be\". I was taken aback as she also retorted that people my age or older were set in their ways and could not be taught to drink the corporate cool aid. She then told me if I weren't already hired she would have never hired me. All my co-workers were lazy kids who every other day would call out sick and they would hide and vape weed in the back all day while I did the work of 3 people, but was not appreciated. I quit and the store went to shit. The Yelp reviews after the newbies and young kids were running the stores were all 1 star complaints about rudeness, lack of customer service, dirty stores, no stock on the shelves, etc. permalink parent award report block reply frothy 1 points 2 days ago Came here to say similar.  If he had just changed the name and the experience up / down a year, then he'd have better proof of his claim. But changing 20 years to 5 years... 5 years = They see someone they can mold and will be a go getter, and will stick around. 20 years experience = Someone typically ingrained in their ways, probably looking towards retirement in 5 - 10 years. The company doesn't want to invest in someone that's going to be out the door sooner and / or someone that just does just above the minimal amount of work because they are 'over' working, just cruising to retirement. permalink parent award report block reply\nDeePlorable 3 points 2 days ago You are right.
