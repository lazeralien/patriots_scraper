I have been dissapointed one too many times. No arrests. No midterm vote.

Yes she goes on Fox news every 5 mins but she has still done a great job with the number of indictments in a short period of time.

All just pyrrhic victories so far. And since Republicans become complacent after nearly nothing but rhetoric their enemies just continue on with their schemes like nothing has changed. Because it hasn't. Not really. Bondi and Patel are literally living in fear for their safety and that of their loved ones are are the entire admin. There is not enough protection for them to follow through and then keep their families safe forever. Trump is the start. The real change has to come after a few more rounds of pain. Maybe in a generation. If millions of us are not eagerly ready to risk our lives then we are not at that critical moment. Deep State Globalism is not beaten with an election. It is beaten by making examples being made out of its ring leaders and their families. Our generation is not ready for that, but the next, after a lifetime of poverty, just might be. Freedom is never given. It is only taken by force, every 4-6 generations. permalink award report block reply HumblePepe 4 points 1 hour ago Trump had 1 year to prove he was serious.
