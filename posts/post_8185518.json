Susie is the gatekeeper who decides what information is passed to Trump and who gets an audience with him. Remember all the people that thought Mattis and kelly were \"based\" and some of us intuitive people said dont trust them, along with Pence.  i'm one of them and i'mtelling you that this women is up to no good. Blondi is just a useless beauty queen. permalink award report block reply Belleoffreedom 4 points 7 hours ago Dunno about Susie, but who the hell do you think is responsible for all those wins at the appellate level and the SCOTUS?  I love DJT to pieces, but the legal mind that is winning these cases and who set up DOGE to be bulletproof sure as hell was not him. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 3 points 6 hours ago We can get messages to him through the post i just did. permalink parent award report block reply Callsign_Fox1 11 points 7 hours ago She ain't going anywhere. permalink award report block reply spez_this 3 points 6 hours ago Yeah.

She has Trump hermetically sealed in a jar. Sure no leaks, but nothing goes in either without going through her. And well, we all know how that's going. permalink parent award report block reply South_Florida_Guy 3 points 6 hours ago Women don't belong in these positions at all permalink award report block reply DirtyDiaperJoe 2 points 6 hours ago I'm a woman and I completely agree with you.
