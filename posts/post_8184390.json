Currently most of the way though Return of the King. The second and third books are voiced by Andy Circus (the actor who played Golem) and it's absolutely great. Definitely helps to have the visuals from the movies, even if there's a lot they had to leave out for time. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 13 hours ago Is the author ever going to finish it?

That's how the left fights. permalink parent award report block reply RolandDelacroix 1 points 4 hours ago It's gonna take the Boomers dying off and the Zoomers rising up to change things. Zoomers and Alphas at least can admit some of the problems.  I'm hopeful for 2028 because Boomers are gonna fall off a cliff, but Zoomers need to get in the game to offset the retarded Millenials. permalink award report block reply Megaboom2025 1 points 12 hours ago Israel marches permalink award report block reply KOMMISSARofMAGA -1 points 8 hours ago Not a great meme, respectfully. permalink award report block reply Washingpede -4 points 15 hours ago Fuck outta here with this bullshit permalink award report block reply\nCovidrrhea 10 points 15 hours ago ngl just makes me wanna watch lotr again, it's been a couple years permalink award report block reply NoticesBugleOWO 6 points 13 hours ago I've been listening to the books for the first time during my commute to and from work.
