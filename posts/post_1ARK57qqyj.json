If every person draws from the treasury the amount that he has put in it, it is true that the law then plunders nobody. But this procedure does nothing for the persons who have no money. It does not promote equality of income. The law can be an instrument of equalization only as it takes from some persons and gives to other persons. When the law does this, it is an instrument of plunder.

We must make our choice among limited plunder, universal plunder, and no plunder. The law can follow only one of these three. Limited legal plunder: This system prevailed when the right to vote was restricted. One would turn back to this system to prevent the invasion of socialism. Universal legal plunder: We have been threatened with this system since the franchise was made universal. The newly enfranchised majority has decided to formulate law on the same principle of legal plunder that was used by their predecessors when the vote was limited. No legal plunder: This is the principle of justice, peace, order, stability, harmony, and logic.

It\u2019s like healthcare 401k lets you save for old age and rewards responsible use.

Take insurance companies out of the equation completely. Honest cash pricing for all services. Every provider pays for an army of employees to process paperwork for insurance companies. The cost of a service is never the cost the insurance company actually pays. It\u2019s a shell game of discounts (kickbacks) and service rationing for people who have already paid 10x over for coverage what the honest cash price would have been. But insurance is a trillion dollar industry and would never allow this. permalink award report block reply Danofdestiny 5 points 4 days ago Or just stop taking it out of my paycheck every payday and let me spend my money as I wish. permalink award report block reply DITTOPatriot 5 points 4 days ago LOL, you send that money to those who take from the makers, and we all know it\u2019s not going to be spent responsibly. But hey, who needs accountability when you can throw money around? The amount of people taking this subsidy is astronomical. They will never fess up, but a simple calculation is all that\u2019s needed to identify your neighbors on the dole. permalink award report block reply The_RedWolf 1 points 4 days ago This is a negotiation tactic and nothing more, and to be honest it's a poor one because the threat isnt real and even if it was, is short sighted for that immediate dopamine hit. The only exception would be is if the start date is pushed back to 2027, because it would take far too long to implement and the gap of coverage would be massive with only ~50 days until the next coverage year, you're not getting any cash subsidy out in time, nor will insurance companies drop prices that fast. You can argue all day about \"I shouldn't have to pay for others\" all you want, and philosophically I agree with you despite using the ACA myself since I'm a 1099, but if people who use the ACA suddenly lose coverage because of a Trump/Republican Senate policy, they're all voting Democrat, and they'll retake congress in 2026. Leading to the democrats using the \"no filibuster\" against us immediately, and probably implementing something far more destructive than the current ACA. Despite Republicans distaste of it (64% unfavorable opinion of the ACA), the overall is at 64% favorable due to 94% Democrat and 67% Independent favor ability, and the uncomfortable part.... ACA usage is 45% Republican, 35% Democrat, 20% Independent Simply put, it wont happen because it would be only net negatives for the Republican Party once the feel good moment ends. I agree something needs to change, but Trump is just blowing smoke here. permalink award report block reply HankScorpio -1 points 4 days ago Yawn. I went EVERYTHING cut. But when you are cutting healthcare while increasing the militarys budget and giving Isrl billions thats just disastrous politically. And if you terminate the filibuster, what do you do when they get in power and theres no filibuster? Dumb. permalink award report block reply spinometer2 OP 4 points 4 days ago If they don't terminate the filibuster they will terminate it after winning the midterms in 2026, win 2028, and then we are all dead (not you of course, because you're one of them) permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 2 points 4 days ago Whoever said you let the Dems regain power when that time comes? Why not use the military to block them? permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 -3 points 4 days ago Guys im only paying 167.00 a month for hc. Geez. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 6 points 4 days ago No you\u2019re not. You\u2019re probably paying 167 per paycheck and then have a $3k+ deductible, which means before the insurance pays a penny you have to fork over $3k if you need anything. permalink parent award report block reply onemanshow 6 points 4 days ago Try 5k for single and 7500 for couple deductible. Basically we never use the insurance at all except for annual checkup. The direct deposit from govt to insurance companies every month guaranteed is the most brazen theft. Shameful. That\u2019s why Dems are digging in. This is a BIG cash cow for their buddies. Nothing to do with actual healthcare permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 2 points 4 days ago All kinds of insurance are too big to be reformed.
