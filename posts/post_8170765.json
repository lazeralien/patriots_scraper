They didn't fix shit, they just promised a lot of free stuff for the workers and then paid for it by pillaging neighbor countries (western Europe).  It all fell apart when they invaded a country too poor, too backward, and too far down the socialist trail themselves to be a profitable colony: the USSR. permalink parent award report block reply Made_in_America 1 points 6 days ago Germany got a pretty shitty deal after WW1. They were split into pieces and forced to pay reparations that left them broke. On top of that they were getting eaten alive by parasitic usury and a Bolshevik-like coup attempt similar to what happened in Russia in the 1920s. Say what you will about their approach to solving things but the Nazis grievances against Jews were 100% legitimate. Their society was being morally eroded with child prostitution and gender affirming theory and economically destroyed just as America is today.

WHADDYOO SAY ABOUT THAT?\" I said, \"That is the most fucking retarded thing I have heard you or anyone ever say. Seriously? That's your beef with Elon? Because that proves that you need to turn off that giant TV and get a clue again.\" He looked red and angry. No one talks like this to Dems, but you all need to. Straight talk.

And lays in the sun on cut grass in my yard until one of my humans show up and feeds me or throws my ball.  It's the best life. permalink parent award report block reply TexasBrowncoat 7 points 6 days ago That used to be the normal salute for the Pledge of Allegiance in America before the Nazis got hold of it. It was called the Bellamy Salute and was used from 1892 to 1942. But since these pictures are after 1942, these people are doing a Nazi salute. permalink award report block reply Tyrone_biggums 7 points 6 days ago It\u2019s called a Roman salute.

They are demons. They just mimic human speech for the desired outcome. You're not in an argument. They elect people who fantasize about killing you and watching your wife hold your dying child in her arms, and they call you the violent extremist. What they say is never what they mean. What they mean is always that they want you dead. permalink award report block reply obamagavemeaphone 4 points 6 days ago Heil lo permalink award report block reply RogueLeaderX 4 points 6 days ago Zohrsn did it too!

Yes, that was what it was.  He tapped his heart twice and then pantomimed sending it into the crowd. K, weird story.  When that happened, my nephew who was homeschooled by my based sister, was at his first year of college.   He started texting his mother about how she could and his dad could be so evil as to support a nazi for president.   My sister isn't online and doesn't really keep up with politics that much and she started texting me frantically asking me what this was about.    I was able to get the vid from here P.W. and send it to her showing Elon did the \"my heart goes out to you\" action.    Then I texted her oodles of pics, also which were on this forums, showing dems doing the Nazi salute that is roman salute or appearing to do it. I'm still just shocked TheNews\u2122 would go to those lengths based on an obvious lie.  I'm even more shocked that people believed that would be a thing.  I don't even think actual neo-nazis give the Roman Salute at this point. permalink award report block reply CrabbyTurtle2 1 points 6 days ago you forgot mandami permalink award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 1 points 6 days ago \"No, the Democrats are the real nazis/racists/bigots/sexists.\" - Republicans A winning strategy, surely! permalink award report block reply Bullet3250 1 points 6 days ago A fair media would have put all these photos on the Front page/vCover with the headline \"Mein Fruher?\" permalink award report block reply Nomad899 1 points 6 days ago Seig Hail permalink award report block reply Amway 1 points 6 days ago I guess Native Americans do the Nazis salute left handed. permalink award report block reply mikejones 1 points 6 days ago All about the Right Angle. permalink award report block reply L74ge9wr 1 points 6 days ago The right initially believed this was a simple wave/appreciation gesture, the left quickly clarified this as a Nazi salute.

They know what they're doing. permalink award report block reply Tacoboutit 1 points 5 days ago You forgot the Mandami one. permalink award report block reply Lurker404 1 points 6 days ago Fun fact: a German AfD politician was recently convicted for posting such an image, not because HE did a Nazi salute but because he showed that government officials were doing it (in response to the left accusing everyone on the right of doing it). permalink award report block reply YT45 1 points 6 days ago Look at all that naziism! permalink award report block reply ancroidubh 1 points 6 days ago Indian Betty can\u2019t even get the correct arm for the salute\u2026 permalink award report block reply knnbccb 1 points 6 days ago The liberal lunatics are absolutely convinced that 'Nazi ideology' or fascism comes from our side.

Hitler reunited Germany with wealthy Bavaria, invested in industry and created real jobs that moved the economy forward whereas FDR created a lot of wasteful \"make work\" positions that critics called \"boondoggle\". But the best thing Hitler did was to kick the Rothschild banks out of Germany. If FDR had ended the Fed, he'd have been more economically successful. permalink parent award report block reply\nJimmyprawns 2 points 6 days ago They were socialists who ran out of other people's money and had to invade and colonize Europe just to cover the enormous costs of their rampant social spending.  They didn't fix shit, they just promised a lot of free stuff for the workers and then paid for it by pillaging neighbor countries (western Europe).  It all fell apart when they invaded a country too poor, too backward, and too far down the socialist trail themselves to be a profitable colony: the USSR. permalink parent award report block reply Made_in_America 1 points 6 days ago Germany got a pretty shitty deal after WW1. They were split into pieces and forced to pay reparations that left them broke. On top of that they were getting eaten alive by parasitic usury and a Bolshevik-like coup attempt similar to what happened in Russia in the 1920s. Say what you will about their approach to solving things but the Nazis grievances against Jews were 100% legitimate. Their society was being morally eroded with child prostitution and gender affirming theory and economically destroyed just as America is today. And it's the same people doing it. permalink parent award report block reply Jimmyprawns 1 points 6 days ago \"Nazis grievances against Jews were 100% legitimate.\" Cope and seeth storm fag. Hitler and Stalin were fellow travelers and the east front was a lovers quarrel between ego maniacal dictators. permalink parent award report block reply\nMade_in_America 1 points 6 days ago Germany got a pretty shitty deal after WW1.

It was called the Bellamy Salute and was used from 1892 to 1942.

Yes, that was what it was.  He tapped his heart twice and then pantomimed sending it into the crowd. K, weird story.  When that happened, my nephew who was homeschooled by my based sister, was at his first year of college.   He started texting his mother about how she could and his dad could be so evil as to support a nazi for president.   My sister isn't online and doesn't really keep up with politics that much and she started texting me frantically asking me what this was about.    I was able to get the vid from here P.W. and send it to her showing Elon did the \"my heart goes out to you\" action.    Then I texted her oodles of pics, also which were on this forums, showing dems doing the Nazi salute that is roman salute or appearing to do it. I'm still just shocked TheNews\u2122 would go to those lengths based on an obvious lie.  I'm even more shocked that people believed that would be a thing.  I don't even think actual neo-nazis give the Roman Salute at this point. permalink award report block reply\nCrabbyTurtle2 1 points 6 days ago you forgot mandami permalink award report block reply\nRememberCharlieKirk 1 points 6 days ago \"No, the Democrats are the real nazis/racists/bigots/sexists.\" - Republicans A winning strategy, surely! permalink award report block reply\nBullet3250 1 points 6 days ago A fair media would have put all these photos on the Front page/vCover with the headline \"Mein Fruher?\" permalink award report block reply\nNomad899 1 points 6 days ago Seig Hail permalink award report block reply\nAmway 1 points 6 days ago I guess Native Americans do the Nazis salute left handed. permalink award report block reply\nmikejones 1 points 6 days ago All about the Right Angle. permalink award report block reply\nL74ge9wr 1 points 6 days ago The right initially believed this was a simple wave/appreciation gesture, the left quickly clarified this as a Nazi salute.
