This isn't about humanitarianism. This is using demographics as a weapon and that is a human rights violation. It rises to the level of genocide. If one third to a quarter of the country is trying to replace me, I don't care about elections anymore. Life and death means I win at all costs even if it requires cheating. I will fully support any non leftist cheating to take power away from my enemies. If a conservative cheats in an election, every sane voter should vote to acquit. permalink award report block reply\nCommanderComadant 1 points 1 day ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink award report block reply"
