But that doesn't change the fact that the shoes she was wearing are rare AND the time stamped surveillance video shows when and where she was on the phone. They have more than enough evidence to get a warrant for Geolocation, which will narrow down the people in that location at that time. They can narrow down further based on gender. The shoes aren't really necessary but would be icing on the cake if she still has them or if they have evidence of them being sold after. Legit collectors actually keep track of purchasing history and receipts. permalink parent award report block reply SwampRangers 1 points 5 days ago The bomber had all three phones' data spoofed by AT&T so had some connection to pull. The bomber had an Outback Wilderness just like Capitol Police officer Shauni Kerkhoff. There is an emoji floating around of a hoodie wearer that looks like Shauni Kerkhoff. The bomber had the rough height and build of Shauni Kerkhoff. The bomber on J5 caused a distraction that caused Shauni Kerkhoff's police force to be dwindled on J6. intense popcorn-munching sounds permalink parent award report block reply barefootozark 21 points 6 days ago Interesting.

But let's be real.... The sad truth is that under no circumstances will a DC jury convict this terrorist. The only shot is a change in venue, but it will be the same outcome in a Democrat city. permalink award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 5 days ago It is treason so the way to make sure the Dems don't turn her loose is that ALL Dems who touched this go to GITMO. Death penalty. Capitol Police = treason = capital offense = death penalty/low to no appeals. This is stuff that needs a military tribunal. It qualifies. There was a declared national emergency, the legal pretext besides declared war, to use the military judicial system for a domestic enemy.
