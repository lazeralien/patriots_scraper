I will try to find some quotes. I was frustrated with her because she's apparently great friends with Pam Bondi and lindsey graham. I'm also frustrated with JD Vance because of the dinner he had with that hindu coalition, where they gave him a little statue of some hindu god, but I can't post frustration about that, because he's vice pencedent and some people still like him. Even I liked him, but I don't want any more individuals coming over here and taking entry level jobs or any other kind of jobs,
particularly muslims + hindus which are not races, but religions or political parties. edit
