There are female-only chess events and championships, however the major chess championships are open to males and females alike. It just happens that males dominate the open gender events. Statistics of gender IQ are interesting. If I recall correctly (feel free to flame me if I get this wrong), females have a slightly higher IQ than males AS A POPULATION AVERAGE. However males have greater variability. Therefore males have more idiots and also more geniuses. A truly merit based recruitment of top scientists, engineers, executives, and other top performers will mostly recruit men, for that reason, with some exceptions. To put it another way, the IQ bell curve for women is taller and narrower, and that for men is more sprawled out with more populations in the tails on both sides -- again, idiots and brainiacs. permalink parent award report block reply BoatingAccident 13 points 2 days ago TLDR, your village idiot is probably a dude permalink parent award report block reply Donnie_Bro 8 points 2 days ago As is the chief. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 3 points 2 days ago And so is your village genius, but that's clearly because the patriarchy keeps the smarter women down permalink parent award report block reply Agenda47 6 points 2 days ago There are female-only chess events and championships, however the major chess championships are open to males and females alike. It just happens that males dominate the open gender events. That's the case with most athletic sports too though. \"Male divisions\" typically didn't need to ban females, they just weren't ever good enough to join. permalink parent award report block reply Major_Nutt 3 points 2 days ago Never ever hear about that bullshit in football especially cause even the \"all sexes are equal\" crowd knows to shut up before 120lb Brittany gets turned into people-pudding at the 20yd line by 375lb DeMarcus. permalink parent award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste 1 points 2 days ago It's not 120 lb Brittany, but rather 5'5\" 170 pound Karen getting creamed permalink parent award report block reply c9AfEoF1StU7C2j2ZUv1 2 points 2 days ago Statistics of gender IQ are interesting. If I recall correctly (feel free to flame me if I get this wrong), females have a slightly higher IQ than males AS A POPULATION AVERAGE. I don't think there's substantial evidence pointing to a slightly higher average with women.  The mean for both men and women are extremely, extremely close. You've of course already added that the range of distribution isn't the same. permalink parent award report block reply tradcathbugman 2 points 2 days ago To add to both your points, most sports actually technically have \"women's\" and \"open\" categories, the effect is almost always the same, though much less surprising for most sports. The IQ bell curve pointiness thing also generalizes to most characteristics, probably because having two X chromosomes instead of one normalizes any characteristic that the X chromosome can affect.  The generalized idea is called \"Greater Male Variability Hypothesis\", it got memory holed for a while during the worst of the culture war stuff, but I hope we see more interesting research results soon as the pendulum swings back. permalink parent award report block reply UntakenUsername 22 points 2 days ago Yeah, right.

The problem comes from the fact that these pro leagues are pretty much exclusively performance selected and women would not be able to out compete men until there\u2019s no spots left. You could have a woman linebacker next pick on any NFL team for example, but there\u2019s guaranteed to be enough dudes lining up for that same open position that a woman wouldn\u2019t be near the top spot to be selected. But if she somehow managed to do better via some super human capability then she\u2019d be put on the team. permalink parent award report block reply bidensmissingbrain 7 points 2 days ago There's a reason the women who made it onto college teams were all kickers. And most only lasted a season permalink parent award report block reply Jimmyprawns 3 points 2 days ago They all peaked in highschool or junior highschool because they got a head start at puberty and finished puberty a bit sooner than the dudes.  But after a year of college, the dudes had all blown right past the hand full of females who were able to kind of keep for just a minute during jr or senior highschool.  And for that brief period, only as kickers. permalink parent award report block reply Dev404 12 points 2 days ago This is going to make the feminists shake their female testicles in anger. permalink award report block reply Strzok 2 points 2 days ago lmao permalink parent award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste 1 points 2 days ago Pretty sure they are tucked and there won't be any shaking permalink parent award report block reply Calumet57 10 points 2 days ago Don't be alarmed.

And maybe it doesn't increase muscle mass or anything like that, it still specifically affects performance. permalink award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste 2 points 2 days ago Huh, so those fat guys with lot of aromatase activity going on have a performance advantage of some sort over leaner dudes? permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 2 points 2 days ago LOL!

On the latter, which led to immense controversy at the boxing at Paris 2024, the future landscape is less clear. It is understood that a rule change around DSD athletes is considered likely in the long run, but faces internal opposition, according to Daily Mail Sport sources. That separate branch of the debate led to fury in Paris last year when Algeria's Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won boxing gold medals after being disqualified from the World Championships in 2023 for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests. So if I'm reading this correctly, the olympic committee won't consider somebody a tranny if they were transed early enough, they would then fall into this \"DSD\" category and be allowed to compete as women even though they're men. Too much to hope for that they wouldn't keep at least one foot in clown world, I suppose. permalink award report block reply Retard_Strength 1 points 2 days ago you'd think they would've figured all this shit out back when East Germany was injecting their women athletes with testosterone. permalink parent award report block reply boomerbutnotOKBoomer 1 points 2 days ago What the hell is \"DSD\"? permalink parent award report block reply dres3 2 points 2 days ago Olympics wants US taxpayer money, doesn't it? permalink award report block reply MAGA1773 2 points 2 days ago Oh wow who would have thunk it?

On the latter, which led to immense controversy at the boxing at Paris 2024, the future landscape is less clear. It is understood that a rule change around DSD athletes is considered likely in the long run, but faces internal opposition, according to Daily Mail Sport sources. That separate branch of the debate led to fury in Paris last year when Algeria's Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won boxing gold medals after being disqualified from the World Championships in 2023 for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests. So if I'm reading this correctly, the olympic committee won't consider somebody a tranny if they were transed early enough, they would then fall into this \"DSD\" category and be allowed to compete as women even though they're men. Too much to hope for that they wouldn't keep at least one foot in clown world, I suppose. permalink award report block reply Retard_Strength 1 points 2 days ago you'd think they would've figured all this shit out back when East Germany was injecting their women athletes with testosterone. permalink parent award report block reply boomerbutnotOKBoomer 1 points 2 days ago What the hell is \"DSD\"? permalink parent award report block reply\nRetard_Strength 1 points 2 days ago you'd think they would've figured all this shit out back when East Germany was injecting their women athletes with testosterone. permalink parent award report block reply\nboomerbutnotOKBoomer 1 points 2 days ago What the hell is \"DSD\"? permalink parent award report block reply\ndres3 2 points 2 days ago Olympics wants US taxpayer money, doesn't it? permalink award report block reply\nMAGA1773 2 points 2 days ago Oh wow who would have thunk it?
