The right needs its own antifa like faction. Intimidation clearly worked for the left. Clinton and Obama took down hundreds of right wing militia even when they obeyed every law. It's time to rebuild permalink parent award report block reply chickeninoven 17 points 3 days ago Democrats twists themselves into pretzels trying to pretend Antifa doesn't exist, while saying things like \"I don't see why we don't have uprisings all over the country\" (Nancy Pelosi). Meanwhile Repubes trip over themselves disavowing and condemning even the most innocent organizing on the right. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... ConfusedAngryArmed 14 points 3 days ago It will never happen for a lot of reasons, some of which you've mentioned. In general, people are too fat, happy, and comfortable for any meaningful revolution to happen. They also do not want to face the reality that doing so surely means killing other Americans, and particularly LEOs, feds, etc. TPTB will never let things get bad enough to actually urge people to make dramatic changes. We will continue to vote while the Overton Window shifts against us. It's like trying to push a massive boulder up a hill to keep from being rolled over; it's a losing endeavor. Additionally, we will likely never see an Antifa-like organization on the Right. 90% of people here would just call them feds. We saw the same with Patriot Front. And while I don't particularly trust PF, it's a good gauge for how the Right would treat any such organization. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 6 points 3 days ago Isn't that what the Proud Boys are supposed to be?

Insane. permalink parent award report block reply TheTruthAlwaysWins 14 points 3 days ago It's going to make 2020 look like a cake walk. They just ran a test run, 7 bomb threats in republican areas. This will be at scale at midterms. Midterm elections decides our fate, and if we fail, the entire world falls too, because we're the only country capable of keeping peace.  No other country has a constitution like ours. If the dems take midterms, they will immediately impeach Trump, charge and incarcerate him, if not outright murder him. You think 2020 was bad? Midterms and the leadup will make 2020 look like a walk in the park. The muslims are getting more bold, Antifa is still walking the streets, cartels are here, the chineese are here, and the dung of random illegals from across the globe.  It was just a week back that an October 7th (or whatever day it was) terrorist was caught in Louisiana. There's no way to eliminate the threats before midterms. The bad guys are constantly pushing violence. It will likely tone down now some until next spring. TrAntifa doesn't seem to like working at night in the cold. That's a pattern too. I expect all of next year to be a steady increase in violence from their usful idiots. Just my take. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 2 points 3 days ago Keep in mind u/maverick202 is a self-admitted redditor troll who comes here to insult \"incels\" and \"white trash\" (his words) permalink parent award report block reply clownworld30330 1 points 2 days ago And the GOP will let them. permalink parent award report block reply maverick202 -1 points 3 days ago Lol nice cope..

Worthless. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 46 points 3 days ago Right now, he's definitely right. If you're saying otherwise, you're either lying or coping. We have to play like we're ten points behind and actually start doing shit that matters, like decreasing inflation. Instead, we're spending millions on primarying fucking Thomas Massie and sending billions to Israel. If this continues, we deserve to lose. If the same results from this Tuesday happen next year, we could very well lose the Senate, too. MAGA has to get its shit together permalink award report block reply DrCowboyPresident 25 points 3 days ago Anytime Republicans get power through populism, MIGA and the Neocons try to hijack the movement and tear it apart. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 19 points 3 days ago That's why we have to destroy MIGA, vote out every single Randy Fine and tell Trump to fuck off when he's taking hundreds of millions of Miriam Adelson and selling us to the Jews. permalink parent award report block reply FaRmErX2000 11 points 3 days ago Separate church and state and separate tel aviv from wshjngton permalink parent award report block reply Goozmania 4 points 3 days ago Impossible when maga doesn't vote. 70% of Republicans don't vote in non-presidential general elections.

They're going back to low propensity permalink parent award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 12 points 3 days ago They don't just try, they succeed. But God forbid you mention the staggering control that Jews and Israel have over our country. It's getting better, for sure, at least now you can openly talk about it here without getting banned. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard -1 points 3 days ago Tea party for example was taken over by the Christian right when its a more libertarian movement. That killed support. And like sheep you follow and do their bidding. People are manlipulated and dont even know it. History repeats itself. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro -1 points 3 days ago Exactly. MAGA was supposed to be the moderate Right taking back the country. It's why ppl like RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard joined the movement. Then the White Christian Evangelical nutjobs decided to take control of the movement and they seemingly opened the door to the White Supremacists. Now you have ppl here shitting on Usha Vance for her being Hindu. Are we also going to shit on Tulsi Gabbard for being a Hindu? Faith has always been a private matter in the US and as long as you don't use religion to push your shit, no one gave a fk. Now apparently, if we're not all White Catholics or White Evangelicals, who don't believe Jesus is about to show up soon, apparently we don't get to be in the US or live and prosper, despite this being a thing for decades now. It doesn't work like that and all this will do will create an absolute hellscape for everyone permalink parent award report block reply LineInTheSand 5 points 3 days ago You have some very odd ideas of the MAGA movement and religion. Faith has not \"always been a private matter\".  People used to be very public and open about their faith.  In the 1950s, they even displayed crosses using the lights of skyscrapers in New York .  Over time, religion became taboo to express in public.  Now, Christians get arrested for praying within 150 meters of an abortion clinic in the UK. Like it or not, the US was founded on Christian values and principles.  We have strayed from those values, and let leftism take control of our cities and institutions.  Do you see the disaster the left has caused in every major city they control?  Do you see the corruption and rot our country endures because of people who live only for themselves and only preach about bettering society, but never give up their power or money like they tell others to do? I suggest you listen to Paul Harvey's \" If I Were The Devil \" speech from 1965.  It is scary how accurate he was about the destruction of America. \"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" - The Usual Suspects (1995) permalink parent award report block reply TheAttackTitan 4 points 3 days ago Considering it was D+10 nationwide this last election I\u2019d say we need to play more like we\u2019re 20 points behind permalink parent award report block reply starjello 1 points 3 days ago Stop that.

We just saw that no one turns out for republicans.  They do for Trump but congressional republicans continue to suck. Watch them cave in the shutdown.  By next year NPR will be getting more money than they were before. permalink award report block reply Executarian2 7 points 3 days ago Republicans CAN win if we put in common sense conservatives like Thomas Massie, actual populists who are America First. Instead, we put in Israel first shills like Randy Fine, who fucking hate America and would sell everything we have to the Jews. permalink parent award report block reply Chango3 7 points 3 days ago Massie has let us down on votes 100%. Prove me wrong. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 3 points 3 days ago Congress has let us down. Massie is one of the only truly America First Congressmen who isn't taking millions from AIPAC. permalink parent award report block reply Corse46 6 points 3 days ago Massie lol. The guy who helped out his buddy Kevin McCarthy, and voted in 2023 to COMPLETELY suspend the debt ceiling for Biden's entire term (ending Jan 2025). Yes, the man who walked around with a \"debt clock\" pin, helped add trillions of that debt himself. If Trump were a Democrat, Massie would've voted to raise (or suspend) the debt ceiling for him. permalink parent award report block reply wartooth6 6 points 3 days ago He also voted to honor George Floyd, but refused to do so for Charlie Kirk (because principles I guess) permalink parent award report block reply ragnarokrobo 2 points 3 days ago You mean \"my kevin\" Mccarthy as Trump called him? permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 2 points 3 days ago Massie hasn't been perfect, but he has one of the highest liberty scores and has never taken a cent from a foreign nation, something that almost no other Congressmen can say. permalink parent award report block reply Prof_Smith 3 points 3 days ago I wouldn\u2019t trust or vote for Massie at all. He\u2019s a theatre production for opposition to the republicans which makes him a democrat sympathizer in my book.   You cannot count on him. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 5 points 3 days ago Like we can trust the rest of the Republicans? permalink parent award report block reply Prof_Smith 2 points 3 days ago Nope.  Doesn't mean I trust Massie.  He's a fucking drama queen. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 0 points 3 days ago Apparently, the consensus here seems to be to not trust anyone. And this is why you dumbasses lose over and over again. Nobody gets 100% of what they want. You gotta understand that compromise has to happen. If neither side is compromising on anything, then its war. And I think ppl here want war. And with war, a new hell opens up. permalink parent award report block reply eclectic22 0 points 3 days ago lol, one asshole is not enough for you permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 17 points 3 days ago All hinges on whether America first purges Zionist neo cons or vice versa.

They are selling the country out and cannot get in on the grift if they enact stuff that literally makes America Great Again. They could end the filibuster and cancel all H1Bs from any nation that has scam call centers stealing from American retirees. (China, Singapore and the great scam king India). Then we also add in no H1Bs for any nation trying to change our culture - India, China, and all of the Middle East get hit with that one.

They are definitely prepping their base to fall in line in favor of something like this by making border security a political issue, as well. I would be genuinely surprised if the next Democrat administration doesn't do this, so we are really only one Democrat away from the brink at this point. permalink parent award report block reply Pats5x 1 points 2 days ago It's part of the GOP plan....they've been in total power since 1/20/25.

They all fucking hate us permalink award report block reply MediaBro 1 points 3 days ago He is right. The Dems have a goal now, with Mamdani's win and they're clear they have enough legal and illegals to help them win that vote. The MAGA base has gone after even the moderate Independents who voted for MAGA in 2024, especially the non-White voters who voted for Trump. In attacking everyone who is not a White Christian and allowing Nick Fuentes to become the voice of MAGA, you'll have galvanised the worst of the Marxists to become the voice of reason and empathy. And that's a horrifying thought. So, yes, the Dems are going to sweep the midterms and win in 2026 and 2028, if this current climate continues. The only way the GOP wins again in 2026 or 2028 is if there is a massive turn in the economy and you'll muzzle the dumbfucks spouting their asinine comments on X. Free speech, where everyone is just calling everyone names, isn't going to win hearts and minds. permalink award report block reply FlyCatcher94 1 points 3 days ago Right.

Republicans could have gerrymandered but chose not to out of principle after ungerrymandering the demo-rat mess.  Now they should do it for retaliation for the cheating in Commifornia. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 1 points 3 days ago Oh, did Texas undo their map change? permalink parent award report block reply DontTreadOnLego 1 points 3 days ago No, the new map that is ungerrymandered is in place currently.

This will be at scale at midterms. Midterm elections decides our fate, and if we fail, the entire world falls too, because we're the only country capable of keeping peace.  No other country has a constitution like ours. If the dems take midterms, they will immediately impeach Trump, charge and incarcerate him, if not outright murder him. You think 2020 was bad? Midterms and the leadup will make 2020 look like a walk in the park. The muslims are getting more bold, Antifa is still walking the streets, cartels are here, the chineese are here, and the dung of random illegals from across the globe.  It was just a week back that an October 7th (or whatever day it was) terrorist was caught in Louisiana. There's no way to eliminate the threats before midterms. The bad guys are constantly pushing violence. It will likely tone down now some until next spring. TrAntifa doesn't seem to like working at night in the cold. That's a pattern too.

The Dems have a goal now, with Mamdani's win and they're clear they have enough legal and illegals to help them win that vote. The MAGA base has gone after even the moderate Independents who voted for MAGA in 2024, especially the non-White voters who voted for Trump. In attacking everyone who is not a White Christian and allowing Nick Fuentes to become the voice of MAGA, you'll have galvanised the worst of the Marxists to become the voice of reason and empathy. And that's a horrifying thought. So, yes, the Dems are going to sweep the midterms and win in 2026 and 2028, if this current climate continues. The only way the GOP wins again in 2026 or 2028 is if there is a massive turn in the economy and you'll muzzle the dumbfucks spouting their asinine comments on X.
