Not bad. This would make HMOs much more competitive. A lot of them will instantly go out of business. Business practices will improve. Healthcare costs will go down. I don't need the $3k. I don't care. I just think we need to stop giving money to insurance companies to the tune of $1 Trillion per year. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver 10 points 4 days ago Words like this are considered Foreplay among MAGA women \ud83d\ude06 permalink award report block reply Awakened 7 points 4 days ago This would be a game changer. The media will report that he wants to take everyone's health care away and send them a small check that won't cover their costs. No one in the GOP will help pass it. At least that's been the last 10 months. Not Trump's fault. The swamp is just too deep. They fortified over the last four years. Him not getting ahead of election fraud in 2020 cost him dearly. I still don't see any real movements on the front. permalink award report block reply NotYourMan 7 points 4 days ago Its odd but the latest changes in the cost of my personal health insurance are four times more expensive then just going to the doctor and paying out of pocket.  I plan to cancel my health insurance and just go to see my doctor if the doctor agrees to this.  Its also possible that without health insurance if I have an emergency then the emergency room will not take me.  The entire thing seems like a scheme to take away my money. permalink award report block reply QSWO1 5 points 4 days ago Emergency room takes Ilegals by law. You will be fine, and charged less. permalink parent award report block reply semsem 2 points 4 days ago This. From experience, depending on the hospital, they may give invoices for the full billing initially, but there are almost always ways to get that reduced if you don't have active coverage. They'll end up invoicing less than they would invoice the insurance company- just a question of whether they'll do that themselves, or if you need to file in an additional process with their billing department to get it. permalink parent award report block reply Danofdestiny 4 points 4 days ago Bring back private practice doctors and medical facilities. permalink award report block reply 711WasAPartTimeJob 2 points 4 days ago Can\u2019t wait for shitlibs to do a 180 and try to explain why taking money from insurance companies is illegal and bad. permalink award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 2 points 4 days ago Replace all FSA with HSA and you\u2019ll see costs go down and savings increase.
