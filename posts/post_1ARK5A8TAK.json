It was reported he was collecting royalties in the past permalink parent award report block reply redinmn 2 points 3 days ago He cant get royalties from this, it went around back in 2018 I think and back then it was shown to be a non-starter.   I sure hope Trump doesnt get sucked into posting stuff like this.  As of now, his posts have meaning.

This claim came from a meme by the America's Last Line of Defense FakeBook page back in January or February. All that page does is put out satire and disinformation meant to trick people, so the left can say \"haha look how dumb they are for believing that\" Posts like this do nothing but give the left ammunition. permalink award report block reply War_Hamster 7 points 3 days ago If you\u2019re correct, and I think you are, this message needs to be spread rapidly. Obamacare is a disaster without kickbacks, but this kickback story is stealing the headlines in many feeds.
