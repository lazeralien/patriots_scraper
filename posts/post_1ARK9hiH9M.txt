I think he was piloting the SS Cat Stevens when it crashed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOaFHmMYikc permalink award report block reply edxzxz 3 points 2 days ago There's an interview Larry King did with Cat Stevens (Yusef Islam) after he got deported for supporting terrorist organizations, your comment triggered me to go look it up.  They edited the original interview, in which retard Larry King argues endlessly with Cat Stevens about his song 'Morning Has Broken' where Cat Stevens explains he did not write that song, it's a hymn, and Larry King presses him over and over with 'yeah, but WHO WROTE IT?' Now the edited version cuts all the stupid badgering about who wrote it out. permalink parent award report block reply PillarOfWisdom 2 points 2 days ago Woah...Larry King was a functional retard. permalink parent award report block reply FreedomLubber 4 points 2 days ago Split Rock lighthouse in Minnesota does a yearly memorial service for the Edmond Fitzgerald. permalink award report block reply Realassman 3 points 2 days ago It’s a scary lake. permalink award report block reply journalist 3 points 2 days ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV9PoWQVga0&list=RDtV9PoWQVga0&start_radio=1 permalink award report block reply YoopersGodsCountry 3 points 2 days ago We listen to this tome daily permalink award report block reply TaxDollarsHardAtWork 2 points 2 days ago What's crazy is that the ship sank in waters that aren't as deep as the ship was long. permalink award report block reply Red_Ensign 3 points 2 days ago Thats why sailing on the lakes is so dangerous.
