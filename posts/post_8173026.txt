Lee Zeldin got 46.73% to Hochul's 53.12% in 2022 gubernatorial. permalink parent award report block reply maverick202 -3 points 5 days ago Ok? That's 7 point race. It's not small margin. Also look at NJ which is redder than NY. Ciattarelli lost by 3 points in 2021.. he lost by 16 points this election. So these states are trending in wrong direction for Republicans. permalink parent award report block reply phro 6 points 5 days ago Then why did you "90% dem it's hopeless" when in reality 6.4% margin is a disastrously slim for a Dem stronghold. 2022: D +6.4 points (Hochul over Zeldin) 2018: D +23.4 points (Cuomo over Molinaro) 2014: D +14.0 points (Cuomo over Astorino) 2010: D +29.3 points (Cuomo over Paladino) 2006: D +38.6 points (Spitzer over Faso) permalink parent award report block reply view 12 more comments... conservatarian 3 points 5 days ago What's your proposed solution? permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

It will be run by the far left for the foreseeable future, barring unforseen circumstances. The whole state will be held hostage by the degenerate, globalist, city. permalink award report block reply Hikedelics 28 points 5 days ago Guess we should just give up and stop ever trying to do anything then. Were you guys always like this? I mean even as kids? Can’t imagine having teammates that would say “I can save us the time and energy. That other team is better than us on their home field, so we just shouldn’t even play.” Is this the same defeatist attitude you bring into your home every day? You let your wife and kids see that? What in the hell happened to your balls? permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 1 points 5 days ago Your "teammates" analogy would make sense if the left and the right were playing the same game. But the right is the only side still wanting to play by the rules, while the left has its own set of rules. We'll see in 2026. If the GOP gets slaughtered in the midterms, I hope you keep this same energy. If the GOP wins, I'll keep the same energy, too, just so you have someone to take out your frustration on. Not trying to doom, but I've stopped caring so much about elections lately. permalink parent award report block reply TheRPatriot 1 points 5 days ago There are a lot of pathetic losers on this forum. Maybe even Reddit plants permalink parent award report block reply lucifer_fit_deus -2 points 5 days ago Time, money, attention, and effort are limited resources. You have to pick your battles wisely. It would be foolish to use those resources when they could be used more effectively in more narrow contests that could have the same or more impact. The question we have to answer is whether or not that is the case here. permalink parent award report block reply Govtizbad 10 points 5 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply Govtizbad 3 points 5 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpMostUnMAGA 2 points 5 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply DlanOdcammron 1 points 5 days ago This site exists to deport retards like you.

There are a few good ones but overall they always disappoint. permalink award report block reply starjello 2 points 5 days ago Yeah women were winning everywhere on Tuesday democrat women.

Now the state is doomed for sure. Republicans SUCK at this because what's needed in NY is a strong MALE. But they always pull this crap of running another woman against a Democrat woman. I'm a woman, and I don't buy into this girl power chit the way the party thinks we all do. permalink award report block reply KernalMustard 4 points 5 days ago She will be Kari Laked. permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 2 points 5 days ago I read the NYC mayor is helpless to the NY governor when it comes to money, and policies.

Appeal2Heaven98 1 points 5 days ago Your "teammates" analogy would make sense if the left and the right were playing the same game. But the right is the only side still wanting to play by the rules, while the left has its own set of rules. We'll see in 2026. If the GOP gets slaughtered in the midterms, I hope you keep this same energy. If the GOP wins, I'll keep the same energy, too, just so you have someone to take out your frustration on. Not trying to doom, but I've stopped caring so much about elections lately. permalink parent award report block reply

mateus 4 points 5 days ago And there goes another Republican representative on The Hill, as if we can afford to lose them. Now the state is doomed for sure.
