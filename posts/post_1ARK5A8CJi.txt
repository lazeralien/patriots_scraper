Some of them even smuggle banned stuff to China, while maintaining plausible deniability and feigning ignorance. The tariffs on those countries need to go much, much higher. Just a baseline 10% isn't good enough. Fuck them up. permalink award report block reply Hanging_Chad 5 points 3 days ago rookie numbers permalink award report block reply Registered 4 points 3 days ago Certainly, they’re aware of this, the section 301 has already been used on the initial tariffs in 2018 permalink award report block reply redditadminssuckit OP 1 points 3 days ago To be honest.. the most is mainly for us to give hope permalink parent award report block reply ncswicn 3 points 3 days ago Excellent post!

Flood the SCOTUS phone lines and cite this. permalink award report block reply Executarian2 2 points 3 days ago The reasons the Court will strike it down are twofold: The specific law Trump used was IEEPA, which doesn’t ever use the word tariffs, so the justices don’t believe he’s legally able to use IEEPA to tariff. The broader problem that Gorsuch was getting at is that even if Congress DID give Trump the powers, because of the non-delegation clause, they weren’t legally allowed to. Congress couldn’t vote to close down the branch even if they wanted to, for example. permalink award report block reply canada_is_communist 1 points 3 days ago And this is why the "law" in general is a complete waste of time. You can always find somethign, somewhere that does or does not validate your actions. WHy even bother lol. permalink parent award report block reply ProfessorJagoff 2 points 3 days ago Na, Supreme Court said no to tariffs, this is fine, he can use IEEPA-based freezes or embargos. They will be begging for those tariffs back in short time, probably before any freeze goes into effect. permalink award report block reply Abovethefray 2 points 3 days ago Hey, also... ask when some employers are going to be charged with hiring illegals.  Why are we waiting for that? Theat will ramp jp the self deportations big time, immediately. permalink award report block reply thp2034 1 points 3 days ago ...and yet it appears those women on SCOTUS are leaning towards restricting the President's ability to employ tariffs. permalink award report block reply rockaustin 1 points 3 days ago Doesn’t matter. Courts will just say no and Trump will listen despite him not being obligated to listen. permalink award report block reply Fren20 1 points 3 days ago Please stop the killing by the federal government of the spotted owls in California..round them up and stick them in a zoo or sanctuary..💯💯💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️ permalink award report block reply Califunya 1 points 3 days ago The SCOTUS IS FRAGILE permalink award report block reply AppalachianTactical 1 points 3 days ago I'm sure the lawyers have pointed this out.

Which crypto are you pumping next? Give me the CA. permalink award report block reply redditadminssuckit OP 2 points 3 days ago OK FAGGOT SHILL HANDSHAKE... DEPORTED permalink parent award report block reply Granny 3 points 3 days ago Lol, notice that the shills have nothing to say about the actual topic of tariffs! They had to really work at finding shill material for this thread!!! So, pick on Jr and Eric, lol!!! permalink parent award report block reply 0111000001100101 1 points 3 days ago Ok here's my relevant comment: DJT could stack section 338 first and then add 15% on top with section 122 for a total 65% tariff.  Then the courts are distracted arguing about the fact he is now colloquially over the 50% limit but he did it in series so it's technically ok and now they have to be tied up arguing about it. permalink parent award report block reply 0111000001100101 1 points 3 days ago I'm not picking on them.  I want to load their next meme in my swap before it does 10,000% in 3 hours.  Tariffs are great.  Arguably Tariffs are among the first anti-american anti-revoultion acts carried out by the masonic hand, and from the other more slavish perspective they are a relatively unimposing tax especially for a domestically productive nation and vastly superior to an income tax.  I want ACTUAL 100% Chinese Tariffs.  I also want 99.99% of regulation to return to the individual states.  No property tax. Severe restrictions on voting aka 1 vote per married couple with children, not accepting and benefits or paychecks or contracts from a government. And YES please drop that contract address we know you're here. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 3 days ago When did handahakes become a waving hand? permalink parent award report block reply newestofnew -18 points 3 days ago they are not here and they do not care about anything but their money. huge liability to trump with their crypto schemes. permalink award report block reply redditadminssuckit OP 11 points 3 days ago Hey you...newestofnew...I don't think you,  a 2 month old faggot handshake shill account, is an authority on this matter.

ProfessorJagoff 2 points 3 days ago Na, Supreme Court said no to tariffs, this is fine, he can use IEEPA-based freezes or embargos. They will be begging for those tariffs back in short time, probably before any freeze goes into effect. permalink award report block reply

So, pick on Jr and Eric, lol!!! permalink parent award report block reply 0111000001100101 1 points 3 days ago Ok here's my relevant comment: DJT could stack section 338 first and then add 15% on top with section 122 for a total 65% tariff.  Then the courts are distracted arguing about the fact he is now colloquially over the 50% limit but he did it in series so it's technically ok and now they have to be tied up arguing about it. permalink parent award report block reply 0111000001100101 1 points 3 days ago I'm not picking on them.  I want to load their next meme in my swap before it does 10,000% in 3 hours.  Tariffs are great.  Arguably Tariffs are among the first anti-american anti-revoultion acts carried out by the masonic hand, and from the other more slavish perspective they are a relatively unimposing tax especially for a domestically productive nation and vastly superior to an income tax.  I want ACTUAL 100% Chinese Tariffs.  I also want 99.99% of regulation to return to the individual states.  No property tax. Severe restrictions on voting aka 1 vote per married couple with children, not accepting and benefits or paychecks or contracts from a government. And YES please drop that contract address we know you're here. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 3 days ago When did handahakes become a waving hand? permalink parent award report block reply
