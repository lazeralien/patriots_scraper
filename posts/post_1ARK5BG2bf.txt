Most grocery stores have only a few days' stock of food at any given time but it takes farms and ranches seasons to adjust their output.  So the food can redirect from high-SNAP areas to cities where people are likely to actually buy more food when it gets cheaper but this is a shock and the long term effect on price should be generally down but may not line up with current results. permalink award report block reply Califunya 3 points 3 days ago Gas in Los Angeles 5.00 a gallon… permalink award report block reply redinmn 3 points 3 days ago Heard a cashier at aldi in Fargo talking about just this.
