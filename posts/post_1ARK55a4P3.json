In other words, slavery. I think not this time. permalink award report block reply ZacPetkanas 89 points 5 days ago You'll also be forced to subsidize the health-insurance cost of people who have retired early.  God bless them for having enough to choose to stop working, but doing it on the back of the working people is gross. permalink parent award report block reply Websitesdown 57 points 5 days ago Don't forget higher auto insurance and higher food cost again.. permalink parent award report block reply Govtizbad 52 points 5 days ago Why is the govt shutdown so bad?

Healthcare and food is not a right. As fucked up as it seems today,  home prices, groceries, traffic, healthcare, etc would not be a problem if govt didn\u2019t reappropriate our money. Survival of the fittest would\u2019ve played out and a vast majority of people would be contributing to society and living a good life. Instead we\u2019re work slaves to fund the lazy leeches of society. What I don\u2019t get is why or how healthcare got this fucked. Why isn\u2019t health insurance like other insurance? Why can\u2019t medical care just be affordable for everyone.. without insurance? Get rid of the law that makes it illegal to refuse to treat anyone who can\u2019t pay.. hospitals are allowed to deny treatment if you deny a tetanus shot, but not if you can\u2019t pay?

BlackPilledMAGA 6 points 5 days ago Those who want to give OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY away to illegal aliens can fuck off and die. I don't care about opinions that when acted upon would subject Americans to slavery. If YOU want to fund them, go ahead. If you intend to force others to do the same then get ready for a problem. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -5 points 5 days ago Go on, give us their demand that is about funding illegals and not about making sure that millions of people's healthcare premiums don't go up by literally 100's of percent. They've got us by the balls on this one friend, I'm sorry. Not funding the aca is a 100% death sentence in the midterms. And we've never not intended to fund it. We were always going to give this up, we just hoped to paint them in the worst light possible on the way. In the end, President Trump will be on truth social touting how he/we just saved the American people 1000's of dollars a year on the health insurance. permalink parent award report block reply justicein2020 5 points 5 days ago the aca subsidization was always going to run out. it can't support itself. it failed. kicking the can down the road AGAIN is stupid. handing over ANYTHING to illegals is a death sentence in the midterms and next general.   and forever. republicans will never get another vote again. this is the hill to die on. NOT funding the world. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Klaus73 1 points 5 days ago I think folks are getting high on their own supply. Its not about common sense or tactics; merely being \"alpha\" and winning...its just about ego at this point. Republicans tried to paint this as the democrat shutdown and that has failed over and over despite what they say - especially when they say \"we don't want to fire people\" and post blue oyster reaper song remixes; \"We don't want to starve folks.\" then fight like hell in the courts to avoid having stuff like SNAP go through. Its a steadily worsening war of optics. Fact is the ACA is a drop in the bucket as far as what it costs vs what its worth and if ACA is willing to be given up thats less then 30% of what the democrats wanted in their demands and then if they refuse it pulls that card from their hand - but folks are so hell bent on trying to dominate the dems that they would rather fuck the entire republic for decades then actually work with the party that still does actually ALSO have American voters...whom the president is also supposed to serve. The stock market is great but generally the gains of it mean little for the average Joe who's closest interaction is going to be a 401k; I cannot recall the last time prices of shit went down because someones stock was skyrocketing. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 1 points 5 days ago HoganT 2 points 5 days ago I feel like there\u2019s not enough of us to even win fucking primaries. There 10-15 or so MAGA reps in Congress is starting to seem just about proportionate. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 2 points 5 days ago MAGA has shifted since the election. I remember \"I haven't read anything about project 2025\" and felt \"Oh ok he has his own plan\" and now its basically a bunch of them. I remember him working at McDonalds to show he gave a shit about folks that were just having a hard time getting by. Now the only thing he points to is stock markets. Anything thus far he has \"checked off\" on the MAGA agenda is only because it was also on the 2025 agenda - which seems to be where his priorities lie. permalink parent award report block reply HoodooOperator 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply HockeyMom4Trump 75 points 5 days ago Republicans only know how to lose. permalink award report block reply EgregiousPhilbin 14 points 5 days ago But you better vote for them anyway, according to the groupthink in here. permalink parent award report block reply makersmarx 20 points 5 days ago Oh fuck off. We are forced to vote for the lesser of two evils. Giant douche or turd sandwich, or dont vote. Those are the options. permalink parent award report block reply DT170x 4 points 5 days ago Acceleratist Are the most dumbest people on this forum. What will happen when Democrats get into power. It almost impossible to remove them(out side of a civil war) from power. Picking a lesser of 2 evils is better because it gives us some time. Also I doubt u/EgregiousPhilbin partake in a primary. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 6 points 5 days ago They really are. Had Kamala won, she'd let in 10 million more illegals, the Democrats would vote for amnesty, and it'd be game over. They wouldn't have to cheat ever again. Every state would be like Post 1986 California. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... joggin_noggin 2 points 5 days ago We should be purging a single RINO cuck each election. We can afford to lose one race, and the rest of the party would shape up when they see the full wrath of their voting base descend on on of their colleagues. Can you imagine how much it would make Conryn piss his Depends to see us purge Graham in an 80-20 blowout? The next election, we toss Murkowski to the Dems if we can't oust her in the primary. They'd get the message. We're not going to toss power in the bin entirely, but we're going to focus all of our energy on removing the least conservative member of the Republican Senate every two years, so you need to make sure nobody confuses you for the least conservative one of the ~50. If we get with the plan and redistrict the House appropriately, we'll hold enough control there to make sure they can keep the government from doing anything outrageous while we work on the Senate. permalink parent award report block reply Kpak76 1 points 5 days ago Well honest question here.

At some point, \"compromise\" for the sake of it leads to the compromise of our founding principles. permalink parent award report block reply GentleSlayer 10 points 5 days ago At some point? permalink parent award report block reply Rakkasan91b 4 points 5 days ago Right?  That point happened a good century or more ago. permalink parent award report block reply GentleSlayer 3 points 5 days ago Probably started  in earnest with Wilson. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 7 points 5 days ago What compromise? The GOP starting position was Biden Era spending levels. They didn't start off with an actual conservative level of spending, just more of the same. That's like walking on to a car lot, seeing a car for $5000, say you'll pay $5500, and then letting the dealer haggle you higher. permalink parent award report block reply RagnarD 2 points 5 days ago In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win.

Compare to Biden's fifteen million. Trump ended Biden's war on Crypto and terminated Operation Chokepoint 2.0.   CDBCs are banned, and the lawsuits against the exchanges have been dropped. Inflation is down, not perfect, but a shadow of what it was under Biden. The J6 political prisoners are free and no longer being tortured to death. Trump has protected us from being debanked.  Countries fucking us over with their own tariffs are being reciprocated against.  The guard has been deployed to bring down crime.  Trump is working to end cashless bail, he's using federal pressure to end pediatric gender transitions.  He's defunded NPR and PBS.  The dept of education has been slashed. USAID is no longer a slush fund for Democrat NGOs to destroy the country The mRNA vaccines are off the childhood schedule.   Trump is working to protect girls' sports. He's secured hundreds of billions of foreign investments into our own manufacturing and high tech base.

In fact, im sure they (the Republicans) will do everything they can to destroy MAGA permalink parent award report block reply AerialRush 10 points 5 days ago They already are attacking JD for listening to what young conservative voters are saying instead of purely foreign donors permalink parent award report block reply InJailOutSoon 4 points 5 days ago It wont work. With or without Trump there is something brewing and all they have left to push their narratives are a dying media that their constituents dont trust -- the ones who do are aging out of the pool. The RINO's will go extinct, its just a matter of time. Hell, Trump has helped some of these RINO's get elected time and time again. He helped put them in some of these positions. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 2 points 5 days ago If JD Vance isn't the presidential candidate in 2028, I'm not sure if I will bother voting. Very few others with the R are worthy of running this country. permalink parent award report block reply modded 15 points 5 days ago Keep it shut down permalink award report block reply Mega_MAGA 11 points 5 days ago It's all about stopping Trump. permalink award report block reply FerkenBlerkin 9 points 5 days ago Media is already saying \"the longest shutdown in American history occurred under Donald Trump\".   They'll always blame it on him permalink parent award report block reply terribletwos 11 points 5 days ago I hadn't heard anyone before Elon talking about how the whole system of fraud in all those democrat states revolved around funding for illegal aliens. If I remember correctly, since we caught their fraud and stopped it, now they're asking for it directly. Otherwise their states will go bankrupt. They don't have any leverage here if that's true. We should force them to do all the things we want in order to bail out their states. Who else is talking about this in more detail? permalink award report block reply HoganT -5 points 5 days ago Despite all our narrative, this shutdown has nothing to do with illegals. It's about not making people's insurance premiums skyrocket by literally 100's of percent. permalink parent award report block reply xanaxagoras 2 points 5 days ago Correct, by socializing the costs. Where do you think you are? permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -1 points 5 days ago I\u2019m sorry, has President Trump or our party presented an alternative to the ACA? Any alternative? Have we tried to reform health care? permalink parent award report block reply Trollasaurus 1 points 5 days ago No it\u2019s about timing subsidies to expire right before midterms. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -1 points 5 days ago Pretty easy way to avoid that. Fund the fucking subsidies. We pay for welfare to every god damn corporation on the planet, farmers to grow food no one\u2019s buying, every damn soldier I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s fully able and working full time while collecting full disability with no physical issues.

The dems are getting heat over the shutdown. They will cave. The only reason GOP is doing this is because they are negotiating their portion of the kickbacks from the subsidies. permalink award report block reply Klaus73 0 points 5 days ago I disagree; general opinion is that the dems do not have the power and there's a frequently ran clip of Trump himself saying a shutdown is the fault of a president in power. That said it is the dems that triggered the shutdown;  however they aren't the only ones helping to make this one particularly bad. permalink parent award report block reply Gadsden 3 points 5 days ago If they do this.....

It's taken way out of context He's already offered them up or down votes on what they want.  THose things STILL have to get 60 votes themselves, which they won't.

Blame Governor Noem who was supposed to primary him in the 2022 election; her backing down ensured his re-election.

Him saying \u201c I am willing the give them all the things they want.\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the senate will.

Zero hedge, while a fun site, does have a habit of being on the alarmist amd inaccuarte side of things The 2nd paragraph says Thune is offering POST-shutdown votes on extending ACA subsidies.  While I agree they should not do so and that the ACA just needs to be gotten rid of, it could also be a bit of a bluff, as it requires the Dems to trust the Reps would actually follow through. Given the Dems' propensity for making a promise to pass legislation and then renegeing (Reagan's amnesty says, \"Hi\") and their habit of projecting their own behavior to others, I wouldn't be surprised if they decline and demand it be added to the legislation to open the government.  Which, so far, the R's have actually held pretty strong on.  And, IIRC, if they do amend the CR legislation, it would have to go back to the House, and I get the sense that Johnson is doing better than Thune when it comes to not giving the Dems what they want. permalink award report block reply TheArchAngel 1 points 5 days ago keep the government shut. permalink award report block reply alucard13mmfmj 1 points 5 days ago Caving just makes all this pointless lol. permalink award report block reply MemeWarsVet 1 points 5 days ago rope intensifies permalink award report block reply kjj9 1 points 5 days ago He's talking about votes, not laws.

Healthcare and food is not a right. As fucked up as it seems today,  home prices, groceries, traffic, healthcare, etc would not be a problem if govt didn\u2019t reappropriate our money. Survival of the fittest would\u2019ve played out and a vast majority of people would be contributing to society and living a good life. Instead we\u2019re work slaves to fund the lazy leeches of society. What I don\u2019t get is why or how healthcare got this fucked. Why isn\u2019t health insurance like other insurance? Why can\u2019t medical care just be affordable for everyone.. without insurance? Get rid of the law that makes it illegal to refuse to treat anyone who can\u2019t pay.. hospitals are allowed to deny treatment if you deny a tetanus shot, but not if you can\u2019t pay?

They'd get the message. We're not going to toss power in the bin entirely, but we're going to focus all of our energy on removing the least conservative member of the Republican Senate every two years, so you need to make sure nobody confuses you for the least conservative one of the ~50.

That said it is the dems that triggered the shutdown;  however they aren't the only ones helping to make this one particularly bad. permalink parent award report block reply\nKlaus73 0 points 5 days ago I disagree; general opinion is that the dems do not have the power and there's a frequently ran clip of Trump himself saying a shutdown is the fault of a president in power.

Zero hedge, while a fun site, does have a habit of being on the alarmist amd inaccuarte side of things The 2nd paragraph says Thune is offering POST-shutdown votes on extending ACA subsidies.  While I agree they should not do so and that the ACA just needs to be gotten rid of, it could also be a bit of a bluff, as it requires the Dems to trust the Reps would actually follow through. Given the Dems' propensity for making a promise to pass legislation and then renegeing (Reagan's amnesty says, \"Hi\") and their habit of projecting their own behavior to others, I wouldn't be surprised if they decline and demand it be added to the legislation to open the government.  Which, so far, the R's have actually held pretty strong on.  And, IIRC, if they do amend the CR legislation, it would have to go back to the House, and I get the sense that Johnson is doing better than Thune when it comes to not giving the Dems what they want. permalink award report block reply\nTheArchAngel 1 points 5 days ago keep the government shut. permalink award report block reply\nalucard13mmfmj 1 points 5 days ago Caving just makes all this pointless lol. permalink award report block reply\nMemeWarsVet 1 points 5 days ago rope intensifies permalink award report block reply\nkjj9 1 points 5 days ago He's talking about votes, not laws.
