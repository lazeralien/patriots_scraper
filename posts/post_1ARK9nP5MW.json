TLDR it means that Apple is working with the government so you can use forms of ID like your own passport to create an ID with them instead of going to the DMV. It's even deeper than I thought it was. So this effectively means that liberals have even less of an excuse for not wanting IDs to vote because Apple just made it easier to get one. permalink parent award report block reply Vice_Ser 5 points 2 hours ago EU managed it in Europe.

Other than Apple getting access to your information, but you know if they already have that anyways permalink parent award report block reply SickIcarus 2 points 2 hours ago Right? \u201cOh no, Apple has my ID - they\u2019re going to steal my identity!\u201d Unless the concern is their servers get hacked - but that\u2019s why you maintain a credit freeze on all 3 agencies anyways. Like what, T-MO\u2019s never getting hacked? Lol! \u201cBut they\u2019ll know what apps you download and what websites you visit!\u201d They already know all that anyways. They already know exactly who I am, so who cares?
