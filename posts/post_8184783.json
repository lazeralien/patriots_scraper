This is America. We voted for America FIRST. Americans FIRST. I don't believe that importing third worlders to replace Americans is MAGA. I know I didn't vote to get replaced by some Indian or Mexican, or Venezuelan, or Chinaman. I don't believe Americans should be second to foreigners. I don't believe that Americans can't be taught how to do an industrial job. I don't believe that we're \"lacking talent\", nor should we be able to justify importing half a million Chinese for any reason, when OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS NOW AT THE HIGHEST POINT SINCE OCTOBER, 2021. permalink award report block reply Dwoj 18 points 6 hours ago Yeah, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with President Trump.

Yet even despite that we have some smart people that went to a trade school instead and have the skills. The problem is companies discriminate against them and refuse to hire them because they're talented White men. So we have two problems: Schools are keeping students stupid and not actually teaching them anything except communism. The ones that do make it out with good skills and degrees in fields that are actually useful aren't being hired because companies refuse to hire talented White men. permalink parent award report block reply taxesaretheft 7 points 5 hours ago If a company can't survive without paying their workers a living wage, it should fail Looking at you Walmart permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 0 points 54 minutes ago Wages should be determined by free market forces.

There is an entire wasteland in CA where the once thriving flower industry, employing thousands, once thrived--we now get our flowers from Argentina. Everyone's grandparents had their house stocked with furniture built by (American) hand in NC--now it's all flatpack assembly slop from China. Small ranchers can't graze their cows because of Climate Commie regulations and they can't process their meat without paying their international conglomerate competitors who own the government authorized meat processing plants.

But that aid should be also require that we accept no immigrants, because that country needs its people to rebuild itself rather than flee their homeland.
