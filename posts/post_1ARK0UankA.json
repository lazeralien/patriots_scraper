In a political race that you actually vote on, you may well hate the person you vote for.  You also will 100% hate the opponent of that person more.

You just heard \" Senator \" John Thune reply to President Trump's request to end the filibuster and pass bills to secure our elections, he replied:  \"NOT HAPPENING\". Today, they will try to distract us by making a statement about how ending the filibuster will destroy our democracy. The \" Senators \" could just as blithely say - we can't divert the flooding river because the tranmyrmecologist lobby has warned us that it will harm the habitat of the yellow meadow ant, while pretending they aren't aware that the raging river will destroy the lives and homes of people for at least 100 miles downstream and it could be easily and harmlessly be diverted. permalink award report block reply RandyMoss 1 points 6 days ago There will be cucks in the comments \"rationalizing\" how and why this is reasonable and not fraud.  They are faggots permalink award report block reply TPMJB 1 points 6 days ago I think it's far more nuanced than \"They're cheating!\" The vast majority of people cannot plan their finances for the week. They exist only in the moment. They believe whatever they hear on TV. Red person is in power and bad thing happen \"Oh noes I should vote blue.\" Blue person is in power and bad thing happen \"Oh noes I should vote red.\" It's that simple. A lot of the reason voting signs work is because the voter didn't even know who was running in that category and now they recognize a name . You guys have to understand...the vast, overwhelming majority of people are not up to date on politics. They vote with feelings. People still see high grocery prices and salaries not keeping up with inflation. Also high home prices. It's that simple. permalink award report block reply possibletower 1 points 7 days ago Hey retarded OP, their voters hate them but they will never vote GOP. You also have to add the number of Republicans leaving blue states which will make it worse and worse for us every passing year who follow elections in blue states.

Good men sat it out. permalink award report block reply\nSpellmonger 1 points 6 days ago We The People have to take the task of securing our election into our own hands. You just heard \" Senator \" John Thune reply to President Trump's request to end the filibuster and pass bills to secure our elections, he replied:  \"NOT HAPPENING\". Today, they will try to distract us by making a statement about how ending the filibuster will destroy our democracy. The \" Senators \" could just as blithely say - we can't divert the flooding river because the tranmyrmecologist lobby has warned us that it will harm the habitat of the yellow meadow ant, while pretending they aren't aware that the raging river will destroy the lives and homes of people for at least 100 miles downstream and it could be easily and harmlessly be diverted. permalink award report block reply\nRandyMoss 1 points 6 days ago There will be cucks in the comments \"rationalizing\" how and why this is reasonable and not fraud.  They are faggots permalink award report block reply\nTPMJB 1 points 6 days ago I think it's far more nuanced than \"They're cheating!\" The vast majority of people cannot plan their finances for the week. They exist only in the moment. They believe whatever they hear on TV. Red person is in power and bad thing happen \"Oh noes I should vote blue.\" Blue person is in power and bad thing happen \"Oh noes I should vote red.\" It's that simple. A lot of the reason voting signs work is because the voter didn't even know who was running in that category and now they recognize a name . You guys have to understand...the vast, overwhelming majority of people are not up to date on politics. They vote with feelings. People still see high grocery prices and salaries not keeping up with inflation. Also high home prices. It's that simple. permalink award report block reply\npossibletower 1 points 7 days ago Hey retarded OP, their voters hate them but they will never vote GOP. You also have to add the number of Republicans leaving blue states which will make it worse and worse for us every passing year who follow elections in blue states. You are one of those retards on the right who keep LARPing that there are so many \"based MAGA country\" in blue states, aren't you? permalink award report block reply\nNomad2013 1 points 7 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply",
