Believe it or not, there are still plenty of people who don't pay attention to politics/news. They don't pay enough attention to know the media is lying about everything. If they happen to stumble on ABC talking about Republicans shutting down the government, these people don't know any better. permalink parent award report block reply I-am-Orlando OP PRO 9 points 6 days ago Link https://x.com/PressSec/status/1986509121751789710 permalink award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 6 points 6 days ago Welp Team Trump you guys probably need to do something about that.

A little courage and some armed soldiers can end them overnight. permalink award report block reply SnowSnake 2 points 6 days ago My boomer mom thinks the shutdown is Trump's fault. So I mentioned the 60 votes thing in the senate and how after 16+ attempts, all 53 repubs voted yes, and the dims always vote no. I asked her how is that Trump's and the republican's fault?? Her face did the blue-screen-buffering thing. While she was processing I said, the news isn't the news, it's lies. You're parroting bullshit you heard someone else say.
