Just imagine how hard your grandkid\u2019s friends are going to have trying to have paying back a house over 50 years. It\u2019s crazy! God bless!!

A fifty year mortgage is just an on-ramp. How you drive it after that is on you. Even if you never build equity you just rented with extra steps. You were going to rent anyway. And you were given a chance. Go in with another family. Or two.

Especially facing inflation.  Its not like you have to go the distance as well.  You can add more to pay down principal if you want.  You might be able to pay it off in 10 years managing extra payments around a low minimum payment.  Just don't lock up insurance and property taxes into escrow or it will erode your principal payments.  You will have to keep bumping up your payments to keep up and that can get out of hand.  Pay for those on the side and your mortgage stays the same.  You can always restore escrow later if you want the mortgage to absorb the costs again. permalink award report block reply BusterHyman99 0 points 19 hours ago Nobody pays in a mortgage for 50 years retard. Learn to leverage your debt. He's trying to do something about affordability. Since none of these cocksuckers are going to eliminate property taxes or cut government spending this is the best he can do permalink award report block reply\nC0drus 4 points 21 hours ago 50?\u2026..remember what LBJ was reported to have said about a certain group of people voting democrat for the next 200 years? permalink award report block reply\nLaptopDied 3 points 21 hours ago Nobody has to pay just the minimum mortgage payment.
