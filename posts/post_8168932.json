If you read about people who leave cults it's very common for them to become atheists immediately upon leaving, if they weren't already. After their horrific experiences with the cult they don't want to have anything to do with spiritual beliefs or organized religion. You can hardly blame them, especially ex-Muslims. It takes time to heal, to rebuild their identity and world view. Ex-Muslims, who escaped a cult whose laws say they can and should be executed for leaving, particularly need security and support among others who share the same risk. It's natural for them to form groups to support each other through that transition period. I don't fault them for that. That doesn't mean they remain atheists and many don't. As time goes on many abandon atheism and begin searching for a belief system to fill the void caused by leaving their cult. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...
