Please stop lying to us. posted 2 hours ago by diestanding 21 comments award share report block You say Thanksgiving is 25% off and its the biggest in history. I am out of a job and day after day I apply and call people looking for one. Yes, it is all Biden's fault but you are our greatest president. Don't lie to us. I know you are giving your all but the people are suffering. Most of my neighbors are out of work. All the illegals are everywhere. Indians have over $100k jobs while we are trying to make ends meet. I have been cutting back meals to feed my child. We don't get handouts.\n21 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save fightfightfightx 5 points 46 minutes ago he answers to Israel so he doesnt care wish reality was different but the US was taken over by Bolsheviks (infinitely worse than nazis, btw) over the last 100 years and Trump ain't fixing it permalink award report block reply starjello 2 points 39 minutes ago Well golly gee.

If White people want a decent living, they should start their own country rather than whining about Indian-controlled countries like the USA. permalink award report block reply sobriquet 1 points 27 minutes ago I hear Argentina is nice this time of year. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -9 points 2 hours ago Go move back to Europe, stormfag permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -5 points 2 hours ago Ron DeFaggot will never be your POTUS permalink award report block reply Grindelwald -7 points 2 hours ago Doomer.
