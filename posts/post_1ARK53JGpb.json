NO DOUBT.. posted 6 days ago by blvntbr 47 comments award share download report block\n47 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Goozmania 18 points 6 days ago There was a meme in 2021 about Nicki Minaj here that almost made me piss myself. I wish I could find it. People were happy about her anti-fauccine position. The meme was stick figures, but one had Nicki Minaj's face. She was welcomed as an unlikely MAGA supporter, and the MAGA hat wearing stick figure tepidly said \"So... ____ ballots were found in the trash\" or something like that. Like bringing her into our entire fold lol. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 16 points 6 days ago She supposedly left the music business November 1. About the time she sent out that tweet.. This might all be a big FU to the music industry and her handlers permalink award report block reply glevert 15 points 6 days ago I'm disappointed in people in this forum who disregard the bravery it takes for someone to take an stand unpopular with their peers. If you keep rebuffing those who speak for Trump, who is going to be left to support him? A handful of purists? No one will ever be pure enough for some of you, and that's a sure way to lose the political war. If this is a forum to support Trump, then stop trashing those who do. permalink award report block reply Cacciali_Via 6 points 5 days ago To claim she is a Trump supporter is a giant reach.
