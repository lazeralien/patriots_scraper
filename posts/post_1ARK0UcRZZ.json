College grads need jobs. American workers need job mobility. Groceries, electricity, housing, insurance and gas prices need to come down. As does the crime rate. And we must take credit for that and make the Dems eat it. We must prosecute the corrupt Dems who spies on us, tormented is, and used the corrupt wheels of the government machine to try to crush us.  Trump needs to play up what he was accomplished via kash Patel, tom homan, Linda McMahon, mete hegseth, et al. Also, Trump needs to not do shit like tear down the East wing and deny he's doing it. Instead be 100% forthright about doing it, and then do it. Trumps messaging has been far from perfect, and some of it has come off like when jd vance called grace chong a \"mouth breathing idiot\".

Remember \"Too Big to Rig?\" Of course you don't. Did you even vote in your local elections? Take anyone outside of your household with you? Ballot harvest? Did you door knock? Register any voters? Host or go to any meetings? I'm betting the answer to most/all of those questions is \"no.\" Outside of voting, I didn't do anything, either. Instead of offering excuses and blame, which aren't productive, we should ask \"What can I do between now and mid-terms to help?\" Calling people doomer faggot on Patriots ain't it. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

Oooooo eggs went down...that was a supply and demand issue, not an exectutive branch issue. Groceries still sky high. Housing still a crisis. Cars still over priced. Gas has stayed level/ticked up not dropped. Please explain what propaganda you're reading to think prices dropped!? permalink parent award report block reply PitfallHarry 4 points 7 days ago Trump told the American people that prices are down. Unless you\u2019re telling me he lied to us all and is gaslighting the American people then President Trump\u2019s words are the only propaganda that\u2019s needed. permalink parent award report block reply load 10 more comments...

In 2021, Terry McAuliffe lost because he told parents that they shouldn't have any involvement in children's education. Then four years later, Jay Jones is revealed to have fantasized about killing someone's children, which is way more disgusting and psychotic than what McAuliffe said, and still somehow manages to win. Did Virginia society just go through rapid moral decay during the last four years? permalink parent award report block reply jcd_007 4 points 7 days ago Virginia has a ridiculous number of government employees, many of whom are currently out of work due to the shutdown. Is it a surprise they voted D? Virginia has also been increasingly overrun by immigrants. permalink parent award report block reply Braineack 0 points 7 days ago Yeah but think about all the good pho and Korean bbq you can eat, while constantly getting into fender benders permalink parent award report block reply Covidrrhea 16 points 7 days ago You kiddin' me?

TrumpInAus 13 points 7 days ago I keep seeing leftists saying MAGA must be crying, like the far left states voting far left was unexpected permalink award report block reply LabTech 10 points 7 days ago I agree, my local elections made me fairly optimistic.  I come from a blue state, and my Mayor's one of the few Republican ones in that state, and she just won re-election over her Democrat rival, who she's beaten before. A lot of the more toxic council members were purged, and more conservative leaning ones got in... and in the grand scheme of things, local politicians matter far more than State or Federal ones, because they're in charge of the day to day affairs on the ground. permalink award report block reply VoldemarBGuerta 6 points 7 days ago Friend, this is the copium that we've been huffing for a decade... if things keep up - repubs are going to get stomped in the mid-terms, just like in 2018.

Under no circumstances are we giving up control of Congress to Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. There will be blood in the streets before that happens. permalink award report block reply unotrumpcard 0 points 6 days ago So they got away with stealing a presidential election but if they cheat in the midterms that's when you are really going to do something? Stop, its pathetic, you will do nothing. permalink parent award report block reply ESAsher 4 points 7 days ago Carl Benjamin has a great take on New York, especially since basically the same thing happened to London. https://youtu.be/d3X_8KPOO0o?si=lQ698YK8NEBfqDBm https://youtu.be/sY5TecSArYI?si=uc1RgHxAkIT1tCpW permalink award report block reply jcd_007 4 points 7 days ago BTC is way overdue for a massive crash. permalink award report block reply 123breadman 4 points 7 days ago Thank fuk you noticed this. This is what I have been telling everyone I know. \"NYC is lost\" lol ok crackhead, when did we ever have NYC? permalink award report block reply Moose_Antlers 3 points 7 days ago I get the emotional reaction, but the response is wrong. What we need to do is get organized and start putting forward viable solutions. This all starts locally. We should be active in running our towns and our states. Without that grassroots base, we can't do much of anything at the national level. The Left organize. We don't. We need to learn to canvas neighborhoods, talk about real solutions, fundraise, etc. We're not going to save our republic by replacing it with a dictator and slaughtering all the \"enemies.\" Where's our healthcare plan? Where's our infrastructure modernization plan? Where's our agriculture plan to make sure we're feeding our population and keeping prices down? etc, etc. The Leftists have plans for all of that. They're terrible plans, but they have a vision to work towards whereas we don't. permalink award report block reply Tophat9000 3 points 7 days ago Personally I'm getting the gut feeling the Democrats by the shot their wad This was their best shot permalink award report block reply lionwind 3 points 7 days ago The NY thing should scare you, it is more proof that demographics is destiny. And the demographics are changing permalink award report block reply ridge3z 3 points 7 days ago Actual MAGA isn't feeling demoralized nor black pilled. Myself, I even voted on online polls that Spanberger and Mamdani would win. But there are a lot of dishonest \"hello fellow MAGA\" actors out there trying to push narratives. Many of which who are progressives coping through such dishonesty because they still know they have lost despite the \"wins\". Even Mark Levin and Dana Loesch (the original anti-MAGA) are doing that again just like they did in 2015, early 2016. But with them.. they are neocons. permalink award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 3 points 7 days ago These pansies pissing themselves are annoying. permalink award report block reply donkeyKang 2 points 7 days ago Was the result unexpected? It wasn't to me. Minneapolis didn't elect a Somali pirate, even though they got the same turd they already had. (I'm in MN, but not MPLS), and all of our school levy increases failed spectacularly. The NYC race was closer than anyone is admitting because of the split ticket. Yea, it's not good for NYC, but as soon as the Free $hit Army realizes they aren't getting any ammunition, things will turn. permalink award report block reply seeling0 4 points 7 days ago Here in TX, we just passed a bucketload of constitutional amendments that take an axe to the death tax, cashless bail, illegals voting, etc.. Commies in Dallas, Houston, and Austin are vowing to leave for NYC because TX is clearly \"fascist\". permalink parent award report block reply seangalt 1 points 7 days ago Same.  i haven't heard about the school levies all failing.  You mean all over the state?  That would be good news considering how evil the establishment is here. permalink parent award report block reply ja391045 2 points 7 days ago Both the commies and MAGA only turn out when Trump is on the ballot.  Only problem is, in the twisted mind of the commies, Trump is on every ballot, in every race, all the time. When Trump is actually on the ballot, MAGA crushes it. This election revealed  two specific problems: 1.)  The majority of unmarried white women aged 18-39 need deprogramming.  They are full on cultists. I'm not sure if the current crop of AWFLs can ever be swayed.  Wokeism is their religion now.  Maybe GOP can target messaging at younger women so the next generation isn't so one-sided. 2.)  We Republicans need to increase the reliability of the Trump coalition before the midterms.   I think that can only be done by having candjdates that MAGA cares about, plus adopting a more \"vote red no matter who\" attitude.     A lot of people might have a problem with that.   Those people are idiots.   If we don't do that, we lose, plain and simple. permalink award report block reply PatrioticVideo 2 points 7 days ago Only dumb people allow fake news that kind of power over their beliefs. permalink award report block reply shadypollster 2 points 7 days ago Love it! permalink award report block reply CrankyCrab 2 points 7 days ago Exactly!

Because that was the other possibility. permalink award report block reply Roguepepe 1 points 6 days ago I see it the exact opposite. MAGA entered their house (NJ, VA, and NY) and made them flinch. Anyone who is surprised Dem areas voted Dem is an idiot. permalink award report block reply realsolidsnakeoil 1 points 7 days ago I've literally never given a fuck about Bitcoin. It'll always be worthless in crunch time, which is when you'd actually need it. New York has always been dumb and gay. Same with Jersey but they also can't drive for shit. SSDD. permalink award report block reply keeman 1 points 7 days ago I am happy with the NYC election.  Now the world can see what you get when you vote for a upper class twit woke commie.  Will be a nice object lesson for everyone else.  Cuomo would have been far worse.  The slow predictable road to authoritarian communism.  Frog boiled slowly.  Mamdani will boil quickly and frog will notice. permalink award report block reply CPT88 1 points 6 days ago The biggest psyop here is the uncle thread trying to make out there are no good women and to give up. That's not true. There good women if you make yourself to be a good man. Don't fall for the modern trap of focusing on easy lifestyle joys. Having a family is the most wholesome purposeful thing you can do, but you need to literally man up and work your ass off to be the best you and a good provider. permalink award report block reply nomoreprinkles 1 points 6 days ago By lying about the economy and focusing on retarded world affairs, Trump is nosediving his credibility. permalink award report block reply YodaBannon 1 points 7 days ago lol permalink award report block reply RusherOfDin 1 points 7 days ago I've been holding on to my Bitcoin since 2017. 10% don't mean shit to me. permalink award report block reply South_Florida_Guy 1 points 7 days ago Been saying exactly this all day long permalink award report block reply Trunks 1 points 7 days ago GA and VA too. permalink award report block reply PhantomShield72 1 points 6 days ago Imagine shitting your pants over a leftist retard winning in a leftist retard controlled area that has seen inbound mass migration of illegals combined with outbound mass migration of conservatives... permalink award report block reply 5DchessWatch 1 points 6 days ago bitcoin dropped 10%  (LOL)   so true! news headline \"Bitcoin crashed to 100k today\"   (GFY) permalink award report block reply MajJamesMcFarlane 1 points 7 days ago All the deluded ones on here wouldn't be so angry at doomers if we weren't always right permalink award report block reply sun_wolf 3 points 7 days ago The doomers told us only DeSantis could win in 2024 because he didn\u2019t have \u201cbaggage\u201d. The doomers told us 2016 was lost too because of the Access Hollywood tape and Trump just needed to step down and let Pence run so \u201cat least maybe we still hold a couple seats in the House\u201d. Doomers told us Trump made an \u201cunforced error\u201d when he trounced Biden in that debate, and now all was lost because they were going to swap him out for Kamala, who he couldn\u2019t beat. Remember that one? The doomers were SO pissed that Trump trounced Biden in that debate. It sent them into total despair. BEFORE that debate they were dooming in the OTHER direction though. They said Trump never should have agreed to debate Biden on CNN because they were going to make cuts in the live feed to make Trump look bad and Trump was \u201csuch an idiot\u201d for walking into an obvious trap, that only the doomers could see. Remember WW3 in Iran a few months ago? According to doomers, America already had \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and Trump was \u201cBush 2.0\u201d. That\u2019s all been memory-holed and the doomers just kept doomin\u2019 on. permalink parent award report block reply seangalt 1 points 7 days ago Doomers = Always Wrong.

In 2021, Terry McAuliffe lost because he told parents that they shouldn't have any involvement in children's education. Then four years later, Jay Jones is revealed to have fantasized about killing someone's children, which is way more disgusting and psychotic than what McAuliffe said, and still somehow manages to win.

A lot of the more toxic council members were purged, and more conservative leaning ones got in... and in the grand scheme of things, local politicians matter far more than State or Federal ones, because they're in charge of the day to day affairs on the ground. permalink award report block reply\nVoldemarBGuerta 6 points 7 days ago Friend, this is the copium that we've been huffing for a decade... if things keep up - repubs are going to get stomped in the mid-terms, just like in 2018.

What we need to do is get organized and start putting forward viable solutions. This all starts locally. We should be active in running our towns and our states. Without that grassroots base, we can't do much of anything at the national level. The Left organize. We don't. We need to learn to canvas neighborhoods, talk about real solutions, fundraise, etc. We're not going to save our republic by replacing it with a dictator and slaughtering all the \"enemies.\" Where's our healthcare plan? Where's our infrastructure modernization plan? Where's our agriculture plan to make sure we're feeding our population and keeping prices down? etc, etc. The Leftists have plans for all of that.

Many of which who are progressives coping through such dishonesty because they still know they have lost despite the \"wins\".

Only problem is, in the twisted mind of the commies, Trump is on every ballot, in every race, all the time. When Trump is actually on the ballot, MAGA crushes it. This election revealed  two specific problems: 1.)  The majority of unmarried white women aged 18-39 need deprogramming.  They are full on cultists. I'm not sure if the current crop of AWFLs can ever be swayed.  Wokeism is their religion now.  Maybe GOP can target messaging at younger women so the next generation isn't so one-sided. 2.)  We Republicans need to increase the reliability of the Trump coalition before the midterms.   I think that can only be done by having candjdates that MAGA cares about, plus adopting a more \"vote red no matter who\" attitude.     A lot of people might have a problem with that.   Those people are idiots.   If we don't do that, we lose, plain and simple. permalink award report block reply\nPatrioticVideo 2 points 7 days ago Only dumb people allow fake news that kind of power over their beliefs. permalink award report block reply\nshadypollster 2 points 7 days ago Love it! permalink award report block reply\nCrankyCrab 2 points 7 days ago Exactly!
