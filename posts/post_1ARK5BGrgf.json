At that point, real progress could be made in this country. permalink parent award report block reply Than0sIII 47 points 3 days ago And then we'd probably get an actual Civil War. permalink parent award report block reply molonlabe9 57 points 3 days ago Well, he said real progress.  That is technically progression... permalink parent award report block reply lostremote- 35 points 3 days ago something has to be done about these illegals and foreigners usurping power.  a civil war might actually be the trick. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... Trumpwon306 35 points 3 days ago If you think the way to avoid a civil war is for Republicans not to consolidate power, you need to wear water wings to drink soup. The only way we avoid civil war or worse, is through early action to remigrate millions of foreigners, and defunding leftists projects such as Obamacare so as to deprive their networks of millions if not billions in funding every year. Otherwise it's just a count down to the mid 2030's. permalink parent award report block reply HeavyMetalPatriot 19 points 3 days ago Correct. Either the left is totally destroyed and 50M+ foreigners are tossed out, or America dies in blood. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... Hunter77 8 points 3 days ago Not sure any of that is enough. There are immense numbers of left leaning citizens in this country. Seems like civil war is inevitable as long as that remains the case. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments... MasterChief08 34 points 3 days ago Last year 70% of active duty military and over 80% of law enforcement voted for Trump. Over 400 sheriffs in America are militia members for right wing clubs and organizations. Sheriffs are 2x more likely to be conservative than the average American voter. A Civil War would be far worse for the left. Leftists in cities would be constantly under fire from gangs so they'd have zero periods of calm while Republicans live far away in secure rural strongholds. And that military number I cited included the 10k LGBT/DEI commisars Hesgeth released this year. permalink parent award report block reply Floridacus 16 points 3 days ago \"Worse\" is a relative term.

Like Iran being able to \"punch back\" and hit a few patches of dirt. I'm aware of rose-colored glasses, and the GOP has stabbed us in the back too many times to trust, but this looks like a pretty big win. permalink award report block reply JohnN 65 points 3 days ago I gotta disagree.  Yes, the Dems caved.  Yes, it's great to see it.  But from now until the midterms... -- \"We had no choice; people were going to starve to death.\" -- \"Your healthcare premiums are going up because of the GOP.\" This will be non-stop.  Many stupid white women will be empathetic. permalink parent award report block reply Trumpwon306 28 points 3 days ago Dems didn't cave to shit. They got what they wanted and the Charlie Brown republicans keep trying to kick the football. They lost nothing. At this point it would have been better for Republicans to keep the shutdown going until the pressure from our side was such that the filibuster was removed or we used the threat of which to demand that democrats vote down filibustering from their side so we could actually pass legislation that might actually help white americans. permalink parent award report block reply Tellman125 4 points 3 days ago It's all about perception as shaped on social media by brief posts from politicians and prominent political accounts; that is THE media now. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 2 points 3 days ago Yep, buts exactly why the uniparty wrapped this thing up before there could be a vote to nuke the filibuster. permalink parent award report block reply ForceMultiplier 2 points 2 days ago Any Senator could delay this for at least a couple of days The House will need to be called back into session and pass it before it gets to Trump's desk. Any Dem that tried to delay reopening the Government could be used as a pretext to nuke the Filibuster. Dems will nuke the filibuster, pack the courts, and prosecute anyone not pardoned if we can't fix election fraud and they cheat their way back into power. Fixing election fraud would force Dems back toward the center because that's the only way they could get elected. permalink parent award report block reply MAGA_APN 19 points 3 days ago Yup-I know several permalink parent award report block reply EgregiousPhilbin 16 points 3 days ago Hey here's a thought.

Nah, what was I thinking. permalink parent award report block reply ForceMultiplier 2 points 2 days ago The MSM lies and distorts. What are your ideas to improve GOP messaging? permalink parent award report block reply ListenJack 7 points 3 days ago ACA subsidies are a political ticking time bomb. The only way out of that mess is for the Reps to offer something better than what the ACA is right now OR fund the stupid subsidy past 2026. My money is on the later. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 4 points 3 days ago How about not having it. permalink parent award report block reply ListenJack 1 points 3 days ago Lame duck for dinner please! permalink parent award report block reply ForceMultiplier 2 points 2 days ago Republicans don't seem to have a plan to replace the \"Affordable\" Care Act. I would love to hear a comprehensive plan permalink parent award report block reply tired-of-crap 2 points 2 days ago There is discussion about taking the subsidies and the positing it into a health savings account instead of providing ACA insurance. Most people don't get anything back because of the high deductible so this way at least they would get some health care. permalink parent award report block reply ListenJack 1 points 2 days ago Thats definitely an improvement from where it\u2019s currently at. permalink parent award report block reply HunterBidensPC 2 points 3 days ago Hard to do when everyone can just point to trumps multiple tweets in all caps begging Dems to end the shutdown and demanding GOP ends the filibuster permalink parent award report block reply load 13 more comments... genericamerican69 41 points 3 days ago If you think the average person blames the democrats for the snap outages etc.. you are sorely mistaken.

The average person is gullible. Half of them will always believe the lie because they cannot ever face the truth, otherwise, it will shatter their little shadow theatre. They believe in shadows more than an actual person waving a hand in front of their face.

The time frame isn't good.  This will buy the crooked democrats time to pay off the crooked republican rinos to vote in their favor.  We know there at at least 12 rino's that can't be trusted. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora 15 points 3 days ago If people who rely on SNAP and people who were planning to fly somewhere for Thanksgiving with family all get their Thanksgiving ruined because of the shutdown, Republicans would be screwed in the midterms, meaning Trump would be screwed for the second half of his term.  Absolutely not worth it. u/lemonparty permalink parent award report block reply MajorClark 8 points 3 days ago Again!   Congress did this.   Trump didn't shut anything down and Republicans voted 15 times to leave the govt. open.  What is it that you just don't get?   It's a #SchumerShutDown. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora 25 points 3 days ago It's not that I don't get it, but millions of low-information voters don't get it, and Dem political operatives aggressively \"help\" them to draw the wrong conclusions.  All they get is that their flight is cancelled or their SNAP benefits didn't show up as usual, and Trump is President. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

Reality doesn't matter; perception does. Now the Dems can't blame Trump for ruining Thanksgiving. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 2 points 3 days ago Trump is Republican. Republicans shut it down.  Hence Trump shut it down in the left eyes. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT 1 points 3 days ago Democrats would have voted 15 times to open it too if they had the ability to bring votes to the floor on it.

Republicans ought to let it lapse and do their own reform with transparent pricing, end of all subsidies, end of drug and care gouging, tort reform and permanent work requirements for medicaid permalink award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 8 points 3 days ago I say let them get the vote. They don\u2019t have the votes to pass it without a few Republicans crossing the aisle in both chambers. permalink parent award report block reply ChinaFlu 14 points 3 days ago Just like we heard the screeching over lost EBT benefits, we will next hear the screeching over lost insurance coverage. They'll fold at the next vote and extend ACA. permalink parent award report block reply Strzok 4 points 3 days ago GOP will talk hard on Fox and then fold like rice paper Happens again and again. We keep re-electing the same uniparty rats in the same states permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 3 points 3 days ago If Trump\u2019s not on board they would still have to get 2/3rds of both chambers to overrride his veto. I don\u2019t see them getting that and if they do then that\u2019s all on Congress and not on Trump. permalink parent award report block reply The_RedWolf 1 points 3 days ago isnt the vote only for extended ACA and not the main subsidy? permalink parent award report block reply Light_HIV_Effect 3 points 3 days ago I don't have any faith in the rinos that are in congress. We already have a few squishy senators with collins and murkowski that love to vote against Trump. The house is mildly better, but not by much. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 2 points 3 days ago They punted to the new year. Basically Republicans caved because they didn\u2019t want anyone missing thanksgiving or Christmas. permalink parent award report block reply MAGA_APN 1 points 3 days ago Bend over -you know that old school GOP have never had a back bone-they only know how to screw the voters. permalink parent award report block reply ConfusedAngryArmed 1 points 3 days ago Imo we're getting screwed just by the nature of SNAP being reinstated. permalink parent award report block reply SqRt7744 1 points 3 days ago Well, that and selling out the whole country to foreign interests and pedos. But other than that, no concessions. permalink parent award report block reply Corse46 42 points 3 days ago Does everyone realize we are STILL using Nancy Pelosi's budget from 2022? We've had the House since 2023 and House, Senate, and WH since Jan 2025, and we are STILL \"continuing\" Nancy's budget from 2025. That's how weak and feckless we are. permalink award report block reply HuggableBear 6 points 2 days ago That's not true. There hasn't been an actual budget passed since 2009. We're still using OBAMA'S stimulus budget, which is why spending is so fucked. It's been nothing but continuing resolutions for 15 years. permalink parent award report block reply JesusTheOnlyWay 2 points 3 days ago They'll revise the budget in just 2 more weeks Or maybe 2 more Trump terms permalink parent award report block reply MakeAmericaGreat9 29 points 3 days ago They were scared Republicans might actually find some balls and remove the filibuster permalink award report block reply Cyer6 4 points 3 days ago That's a possibility. They got a few R's to go to the D's and say... \"We now have the numbers to do this and if it does, we're going to ram everything Trump has right through before Thanksgiving and he'll sign it the next day.\" permalink parent award report block reply politicsaside 9 points 3 days ago We need to do it anyways. It\u2019s time. This is not a win. Nuking the filibuster would\u2019ve been a win. This is a uniparty win, not us. permalink parent award report block reply The_RedWolf 1 points 3 days ago I'm glad they didnt.  Sure we'd get some wins now, but the moment Dems retook office, it'd be all undone and worse because they are more depraved than we are in general. permalink parent award report block reply DingleBalls 28 points 3 days ago So, what did we REALLY give up that isn't being officially said yet? permalink award report block reply POTUS_DonnieJ 19 points 3 days ago Heard some rumors about having to rehire federal employees fired since October.

It also would require agencies to give written notice to Congress about the withdrawal of the layoff notices issued during the funding lapse, plus details on the amount of back pay owed. permalink parent award report block reply pollsarefake -6 points 3 days ago Trump never gives an inch This is what happens when you have a powerful alpha like Trump in charge We are winning like never before on all fronts And the best is yet to come permalink parent award report block reply Simple_Doot 3 points 3 days ago Uhhhhh what permalink parent award report block reply Visceroth 28 points 3 days ago that's a loss for our side.\nzero good news lately. no funding cuts, no prosecutions, no codifying MAGA, no mass firings, AND they're letting professional welfare queens steal our tax money again. permalink award report block reply Simple_Doot 12 points 3 days ago I can't find anything to be proud of. permalink parent award report block reply BoomShtick 10 points 3 days ago Same old shit different day permalink parent award report block reply Bythrfruitsyknow 27 points 3 days ago So kicking the can down the road again? fucking papermache is more rigid than any Republicans spine. permalink award report block reply MOLON-LABE 24 points 3 days ago I would rather the shutdown continue and drain the leftist of every penny they have stolen from us. permalink award report block reply Cyer6 2 points 3 days ago Same here but having air traffic controllers and other critical workers not getting paid would've led to many just walking away. All air traffic could shutdown including commercial cargo which would lead to supply chain disruptions down to the trucks that roll into stores every day.

Scumbag fuck. permalink award report block reply ridge3z 1 points 3 days ago Republicans can maximize their political and public relations (PR) advantage from the end of the government shutdown by focusing their messaging, legislative strategy, and grassroots engagement. This approach involves both highlighting GOP achievements and proactively countering Democratic narratives about the shutdown and healthcare. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of how Republicans and their supporters can pull this into their favor: Strategic GOP Messaging Emphasize Responsibility and Stability: Republicans should consistently frame themselves as the party that prioritized the national interest, restoring government services, paychecks for federal workers, and critical programs for families and veterans after weeks of Democratic obstruction. They can stress that they worked across the aisle, while Democrats eventually relented to public pressure.[1][2] Highlight Concessions Won: Reiterate that Democrats failed in their attempt to force through immediate ACA subsidy extensions\u2014these were postponed in favor of a promise for a future Senate vote, not a done deal. Republicans can credit their negotiating strategy for avoiding a costly expansion of government entitlements \u201cforced\u201d by Democrats during a crisis.[3][1] Underscore Economic Impact: Make the case that ending the shutdown limited further economic damage, and warn voters about the dangers of partisan brinkmanship tied to unpopular or costly Democratic demands. Point to restored federal operations, normalizing travel and economic activity before Thanksgiving, as examples of Republican responsiveness.[1] PR and Media Tactics Leverage Social and Conservative Media: Republican officeholders, influencers, and grassroots supporters should flood social media and conservative outlets with concise, repeated talking points about Democratic \u201chostage-taking,\u201d the hardship caused by the shutdown fight, and the GOP\u2019s solution-oriented approach. Use Testimonials: Spotlight stories of workers and families hurt by the prolonged shutdown, blaming Democratic intransigence. Feature business owners, federal employees, travelers, and beneficiaries of restored programs thanking GOP leaders for reopening the government. Contrast Leadership Styles: Frame President Trump and GOP Senate leaders as \u201ctough negotiators\u201d who forced the opposition to compromise, compared to Democrats who were \u201cdivided and unrealistic.\u201d Legislative and Voting Strategy Demand Accountability: Call for hearings, town halls, and investigations into the effects of the Democratic shutdown, using them as campaign platforms to energize conservative voters and independents frustrated by the gridlock. Prepare for ACA Vote: Position the upcoming December vote on ACA subsidies as a chance for Republicans to hold Democrats to account for costly health care proposals\u2014launch educational campaigns about the fiscal downsides of enhanced subsidies and promote alternatives like health savings accounts or private options. Keep Unity: Encourage all wings of the GOP, including more populist (MAGA) factions, to unite behind the narrative that Republican persistence delivered results for ordinary Americans. Grassroots and Regular Citizen Engagement Mobilize Local Activists: Encourage conservatives, MAGA supporters, and regular citizens to call into talk radio, attend local GOP events, and share stories online amplifying the Republican version of events. Use Letter-Writing and Opinion Pieces: Submit op-eds and letters to editors in local newspapers blaming Democrats for the hardship, praising Republican efforts, and warning about future Democratic spending proposals. Challenge Opposing Narratives: Actively push back on Democratic claims that they \u201cprotected health care,\u201d emphasizing instead the delays, disruptions, and economic harm their stance created. Counteracting Democrat Narratives Refocus Debate: When Democrats argue that they won a future vote or protected the ACA, Republicans should respond that they forced Democrats to drop their immediate demands, prevented a massive increase in spending, and extracted key concessions on layoffs and SNAP funding. Fact-Check in Real-Time: Use social media graphics, talk shows, and independent fact-checkers to challenge any Democratic claims of overall \u201cvictory,\u201d pointing out what was left out or postponed. Engage Independent and Swing Voters: Stress the bipartisan nature of the final deal and frame it as commonsense governance after weeks of unnecessary Democratic-driven pain. By relentlessly repeating these themes and encouraging broad-based participation, the GOP can position the shutdown\u2019s end as a Republican win for order, responsibility, and economic stability, while putting Democrats on the defensive about their strategy and motivations.[2][3][1] 1 2 3 permalink award report block reply here2red 1 points 3 days ago blegh permalink award report block reply Getelectedordietryin 1 points 3 days ago Fucking bull shit I wanted at least a year of the shutdown permalink award report block reply mass55th 1 points 3 days ago Great deal for the RATS so they have three months to get their strategy together for the next continuing resolution.

Trumpwon306 35 points 3 days ago If you think the way to avoid a civil war is for Republicans not to consolidate power, you need to wear water wings to drink soup. The only way we avoid civil war or worse, is through early action to remigrate millions of foreigners, and defunding leftists projects such as Obamacare so as to deprive their networks of millions if not billions in funding every year. Otherwise it's just a count down to the mid 2030's. permalink parent award report block reply HeavyMetalPatriot 19 points 3 days ago Correct.

I'm aware of rose-colored glasses, and the GOP has stabbed us in the back too many times to trust, but this looks like a pretty big win. permalink award report block reply JohnN 65 points 3 days ago I gotta disagree.  Yes, the Dems caved.  Yes, it's great to see it.

Many stupid white women will be empathetic. permalink parent award report block reply Trumpwon306 28 points 3 days ago Dems didn't cave to shit. They got what they wanted and the Charlie Brown republicans keep trying to kick the football. They lost nothing. At this point it would have been better for Republicans to keep the shutdown going until the pressure from our side was such that the filibuster was removed or we used the threat of which to demand that democrats vote down filibustering from their side so we could actually pass legislation that might actually help white americans. permalink parent award report block reply Tellman125 4 points 3 days ago It's all about perception as shaped on social media by brief posts from politicians and prominent political accounts; that is THE media now. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 2 points 3 days ago Yep, buts exactly why the uniparty wrapped this thing up before there could be a vote to nuke the filibuster. permalink parent award report block reply ForceMultiplier 2 points 2 days ago Any Senator could delay this for at least a couple of days The House will need to be called back into session and pass it before it gets to Trump's desk. Any Dem that tried to delay reopening the Government could be used as a pretext to nuke the Filibuster. Dems will nuke the filibuster, pack the courts, and prosecute anyone not pardoned if we can't fix election fraud and they cheat their way back into power.

We need to insist there will be no more CRS after this point By passing the budget bills themselves 1 by 1.  Each budget bill needs to be gone through and have its fat eliminated.

Scumbag fuck. permalink award report block reply\nridge3z 1 points 3 days ago Republicans can maximize their political and public relations (PR) advantage from the end of the government shutdown by focusing their messaging, legislative strategy, and grassroots engagement. This approach involves both highlighting GOP achievements and proactively countering Democratic narratives about the shutdown and healthcare. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of how Republicans and their supporters can pull this into their favor: Strategic GOP Messaging Emphasize Responsibility and Stability: Republicans should consistently frame themselves as the party that prioritized the national interest, restoring government services, paychecks for federal workers, and critical programs for families and veterans after weeks of Democratic obstruction. They can stress that they worked across the aisle, while Democrats eventually relented to public pressure.[1][2] Highlight Concessions Won: Reiterate that Democrats failed in their attempt to force through immediate ACA subsidy extensions\u2014these were postponed in favor of a promise for a future Senate vote, not a done deal. Republicans can credit their negotiating strategy for avoiding a costly expansion of government entitlements \u201cforced\u201d by Democrats during a crisis.[3][1] Underscore Economic Impact: Make the case that ending the shutdown limited further economic damage, and warn voters about the dangers of partisan brinkmanship tied to unpopular or costly Democratic demands. Point to restored federal operations, normalizing travel and economic activity before Thanksgiving, as examples of Republican responsiveness.[1] PR and Media Tactics Leverage Social and Conservative Media: Republican officeholders, influencers, and grassroots supporters should flood social media and conservative outlets with concise, repeated talking points about Democratic \u201chostage-taking,\u201d the hardship caused by the shutdown fight, and the GOP\u2019s solution-oriented approach. Use Testimonials: Spotlight stories of workers and families hurt by the prolonged shutdown, blaming Democratic intransigence. Feature business owners, federal employees, travelers, and beneficiaries of restored programs thanking GOP leaders for reopening the government. Contrast Leadership Styles: Frame President Trump and GOP Senate leaders as \u201ctough negotiators\u201d who forced the opposition to compromise, compared to Democrats who were \u201cdivided and unrealistic.\u201d Legislative and Voting Strategy Demand Accountability: Call for hearings, town halls, and investigations into the effects of the Democratic shutdown, using them as campaign platforms to energize conservative voters and independents frustrated by the gridlock. Prepare for ACA Vote: Position the upcoming December vote on ACA subsidies as a chance for Republicans to hold Democrats to account for costly health care proposals\u2014launch educational campaigns about the fiscal downsides of enhanced subsidies and promote alternatives like health savings accounts or private options. Keep Unity: Encourage all wings of the GOP, including more populist (MAGA) factions, to unite behind the narrative that Republican persistence delivered results for ordinary Americans. Grassroots and Regular Citizen Engagement Mobilize Local Activists: Encourage conservatives, MAGA supporters, and regular citizens to call into talk radio, attend local GOP events, and share stories online amplifying the Republican version of events. Use Letter-Writing and Opinion Pieces: Submit op-eds and letters to editors in local newspapers blaming Democrats for the hardship, praising Republican efforts, and warning about future Democratic spending proposals. Challenge Opposing Narratives: Actively push back on Democratic claims that they \u201cprotected health care,\u201d emphasizing instead the delays, disruptions, and economic harm their stance created. Counteracting Democrat Narratives Refocus Debate: When Democrats argue that they won a future vote or protected the ACA, Republicans should respond that they forced Democrats to drop their immediate demands, prevented a massive increase in spending, and extracted key concessions on layoffs and SNAP funding. Fact-Check in Real-Time: Use social media graphics, talk shows, and independent fact-checkers to challenge any Democratic claims of overall \u201cvictory,\u201d pointing out what was left out or postponed. Engage Independent and Swing Voters: Stress the bipartisan nature of the final deal and frame it as commonsense governance after weeks of unnecessary Democratic-driven pain. By relentlessly repeating these themes and encouraging broad-based participation, the GOP can position the shutdown\u2019s end as a Republican win for order, responsibility, and economic stability, while putting Democrats on the defensive about their strategy and motivations.[2][3][1] 1 2 3 permalink award report block reply\nhere2red 1 points 3 days ago blegh permalink award report block reply\nGetelectedordietryin 1 points 3 days ago Fucking bull shit I wanted at least a year of the shutdown permalink award report block reply\nmass55th 1 points 3 days ago Great deal for the RATS so they have three months to get their strategy together for the next continuing resolution.
