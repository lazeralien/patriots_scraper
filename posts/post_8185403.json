Trump 75% based is still 1000x better than any (D) or RINO. posted 3 hours ago by try4gain PRO 28 comments award share download report block\n28 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Awakened 19 points 3 hours ago Being slowly boiled is much more dangerous than a quick jolt. Look, it isn't just this. It started with the Epstein thing and was followed by a lot of other things. You're not gonna rally the troops when all they are doing is responding to him saying anti-MAGA things. Their reaction isn't their fault, it's Trumps. They are reacting naturally to betrayal on the most important thing their is, American jobs. Main street versus Wall street. Trump needs massive turnout to overcome fraud in the midterms, since he hasn't pulled off any major arrests at this point, expect it to be massive massive fraud. He will not get that at this point. Worse, it could be a total route.  Then they will not only have the votes to impeach him, but remove him. Then throw him and his in jail. Someone better wake him up. But most here are done pretending everything is all right. Good luck permalink award report block reply Standingoak -1 points 2 hours ago They are reacting naturally Thanks for letting everyone know YOU are not MAGA because : 'We are reacting naturally' permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 2 points 2 hours ago Lol. This shit doesn't work on those of us who risked everything for MAGA and for Trump.  You just seem retarded, but not in the good way. We deserve better shills. permalink parent award report block reply try4gain OP PRO -3 points 2 hours ago Trump was never perfect and will never be.  Every President & Politician makes promises they cant deliver on. Epstein files : This is the new JFK files.  Going to take ages to release.  Trump realized it was MI6 CIA Mossad and so had to do a hard awkward pivot which he handled poorly. If Trump was in the Epstein files Biden & Co would have leaked it to the press. Trump has always had a habbit of putting his foot in his mouth at least once a month.  Then  the base pushes back hard enough and often he changes course.  But dont expect that with Epstein because it's CIA Mossad shit. Trump is the start of the MAGA movement.  We wont get everything we want.  JD Vance will be the next step. This is a multi-term multi-decade movement.  It took decades for leftist and RINOs to get us in this mess, we're not getting out with a few executive orders. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 2 points 2 hours ago Except, and this is very important, are you ready JOBS! That's the real reason he is there and he just shit on his reason. Shit all over it. Oh, and this is also important TELLING US TO WAIT NO LONGER WORKS Because we know what happened last term. We are through being strung along and treated secondary. We are so completely done. The midterms will be here soon. No one can buy a house and groceries are still through the roof. Forget about a nice night eating out. We are circling the drain. Also, we don't want Vance. He is a tech bro puppet and super pro H1b. You guys really don't get it. You're about to lose in a massive way. Also, Vivek will turn Ohio over to the commies because he will be losing. Well done Trump, well done. You people really don't get what's coming do you?

I'll wait. Shouldn't be much longer. permalink parent award report block reply NotYourMan -3 points 3 hours ago Trump is learning.  Keep the voice loud; stop the dooming.  Here is an idea, H1B-visa employees get a yearly fee equal to 20% of their salary.  The federal government uses that money as grants for US citizens at universities to get masters degrees in real, practical majors like Computer Science or EE or other engineering fields (no funds for DEI majors like Racial Equity majors). permalink award report block reply bratt 1 points 2 hours ago H1B-visa employees are assigned a equal wage trainee that shadows their every move. The trainee can attend additional schooling as required. Then send the H1B home unless more trainees are needed. Then send him home.
