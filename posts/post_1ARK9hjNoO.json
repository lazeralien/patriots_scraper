They system kind of collapsed in the early 20th century though because of all the immigrants from Europe who transformed all the big cities into Democrat bastions of perfidy, corruption, mobsters and drunks. Aside from asylums, where actual mentally ill people went, not crazy criminals that brought on their psychosis by narcotics, people who were indigent could go work on a county farm.  Men and women lived separately and there were some housing for families that fell on hard times. The people there would work the farm, process the raw agricultural product and then receive some money that was put into an account for them.   They worked the farm until they had enough to go get housing or found gainful employment.  One catch though, the person had to live in the communal housing, no alcohol, meals in common, Private property that wasn't needed had to be stored or sold off.  Often county farms were run by local churches so the workers had to attend church services on Sundays and sometimes, complete a Bible study.   Also, the workers right to freely come and go was restricted.  They had to stay on the farm and there were curfews.  Most of them didn't allow gambling either.  To leave the farm, they had to show they had housing or gainful employment or a relative with housing was taking the person in. permalink award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 -3 points 2 days ago TIL MCFGA Make County Farms Great Again Also, updoot for using \"perfidy,\" we should use that at the nearest antifa meeting to watch their heads explode permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch 2 points 2 days ago She's correct about the ACA number--the avg aca subsidy was that, in 2025 its over 600.  Dont know about snap . But it doesn't matter Because ACA is horrific corporatism, not socialism-- and the subsidy is only for the poor.  The middle class again, is the one screwed the hardest. People's premiums have gone asymptotic It's worse than having nothing at all.  Obama has nearly destroyed this country with it; and its been a gift to the healthcare systems and healthcare insurance industry at the cost of end user wealth accumulation. We should always be trying to increase wealth of the middle class working person.  Period. That's the foundational principle of america.  Leave people alone so they can work and be fruitful.
