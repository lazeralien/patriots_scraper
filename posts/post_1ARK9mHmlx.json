If it was back in 2017, then everything he is doing: reforming H1B, deporting only illegals, and only arresting a few perps would have been fine. But the problem is that it isn\u2019t 2017. It\u2019s 2025 and we just got out of the most corrupt and evil administration in American history. An administration that flooded the country with illegal aliens, gave out a record number of H1Bs, and staffed the government with the wokest and most corrupt people in America. Trump fails to realize that after all that, the people don\u2019t want to reform H1B, they want to end it, they don\u2019t want to just deport illegals, but to actively end all immigration. Trump has stayed pretty consistent, he wants to reform the existing order, not uproot it entirely. But his base has gone further right and now wants radical reforms, and if we don\u2019t get it, then we want revolution. permalink award report block reply ACActual 1 points 3 hours ago Exactly permalink parent award report block reply VaporJet11 5 points 9 hours ago Well said and true for most Americans feel the same.
