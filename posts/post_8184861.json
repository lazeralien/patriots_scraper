  "content": "836 The long term \"necessity\" of H1B's is a lie.  An American can be trained for every one of these roles in a short time period.  They steal an American's job every single time and depress wages for that role for every other American. posted 13 hours ago by Diversity_Fire 63 comments award share report block The only difference between an H1B hire and an illegal alien hire is that instead of stealing an extreme low wage manual labor job, they are stealing a higher paying job from middle income Americans. (and have the same wage depressing effect as well) These companies are, in effect, selling access to America in exchange for low wages and circumventing the immigration process. The US military trains people to work on the most advanced fighter jets in the world with a few weeks to a few months training. There is ZERO excuse for these large companies to be allowed to sell access to America just because they make larger donations to politicians than individuals can. If it is about a specialized job, FORCE THE COMPANY to have a SHORT TERM H1B, for a specific role, and only if they have demonstrated a TRAINING PROGRAM where the need for that H1B will be fixed in short order. As a worker for a big tech company, there is NO part of my job I cannot train someone to do OJT in just a few months.\n63 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save sir_rockness 38 points 11 hours ago It's all about greed.

It is also nepotism and racism.  They will go to great lengths to make sure as many people in an organization looks like they do.

My last job I got hired for, my boss had to run through 4 levels of exceptions to say THIS JOB CAN'T BE DONE INTERNATIONALLY, before they'd hire stateside.  4 levels of exceptions and approvals just to hire in the US.

Everyone should read this article. https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2025/11/11/the-2025-maga-fracture-and-the-benefactors-behind-it/ \"This effort to split the MAGA base, using Israel or (insert_next_thing_here) as a wedge issue within the America First movement \u2013 only benefits one larger apparatus, the Sea Island billionaire control system.\" permalink award report block reply ShadowInv 6 points 9 hours ago But they aren't wrong about it, f isreal and f h1b's permalink parent award report block reply Oleander 6 points 8 hours ago So what do you want us to do, clap like a goddamn seal united and happy when what they're doing is the opposite of MAGA?

It's about having a mindless, compliant workforce, who will allow you to treat them like slave labor to avoid being sent back to their shitholes. Big Corporate is just as bad as Big Socialist Government. permalink award report block reply rebuildingMyself 3 points 10 hours ago And those low wage jobs tht used to be done by young teenagers needing money for school or (God forbid) their own hobbies are replaced by jeets. Little Billy earning money by mowing his neighbors lawns? Nah we have illegal slave labor for that now. So those young ambitious kids are denied the opportunity to build valuable skills and learn hard lessons while the cost of failure is cheap are told to shut up and study their Marxist programming instead. That way they can eventually vote for Commies like Mamdami who promise free gibs from the sky only to revoke the promise right after giving him the vote he needed. permalink award report block reply dtrap 2 points 8 hours ago The fact that they force Americans to train H1Bs before the Americans are replaced by H1Bs says it all. This is about long term control of wage growth. American gets in, gets 6-8 months of experience, then levels up for $5-10-k. Any employer that doesn't want to waste money on churn will pony up. The solution? H1B visa holders. Once sponsored they are stuck with their employer for 3 years. If the H1B visa holder even thinks of playing the field, the employer cancels the visa and the visa holder has 3 months to either find a new sponsor or liquidate their US life and self-deport. Visa holders stay put and accept the wages given for year or decades at a time. Docile. Controlled. The H1B visa is just moving indentured servitude up the employment chain. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 2 points 3 hours ago Don't blame Trump, blame the Department of Edumacate permalink award report block reply ATX_for_Trump 2 points 9 hours ago American's are already in these roles and are just being replaced by cheaper labor.

Positions where your company needs a very specific person for a very specific role in your company, ok.  The total number issued each year should be under 500. permalink award report block reply It_takes_10_years 1 points 7 hours ago Trump disagrees with you. \"I know what MAGA wants better than anyone else\" Ingraham countered him, saying that US has \"plenty of talented people.\" Trump in response said, \"No, you don't. There are certain skills you don't have, and people have to learn them. You can't take people off the unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles.'\" America requires foreigners because Americans are too stupid!

Cool permalink award report block reply frenacrossthepond 0 points 9 hours ago The same story in Europe. Large companies have lobbied to allow importation of Indian workers etc... They are only doing this to increase the size of their workforce in order to a) demonstrate \"growth\" for shareholders/stock price and b) so that a company can apply for more national and EU funding. The whole thing is a racket. In fact worker's salaries are often so subsidized by the state that the state would actually save money if the workers were fired and they would claim unemployment money instead. Many times internal company projects are started just for the sole purpose of getting more state funding and increasing the workforce numbers. Actual project - no one gives a fuck about...it will never become a product or service offered to a customer. The biggest players are the ones exploiting the system to the max...and then the ceos use every tax evasion trick to keep more money. It' called \"milking the system\" and there are many start-ups that seem designed to do just that. permalink award report block reply NZbacon 0 points 9 hours ago If foreign work is required then it can be done remotely. permalink award report block reply flashersenpai 0 points 5 hours ago But Bessent just said H1B could need 3-7 years to train workers! permalink award report block reply Greenhills 0 points 8 hours ago Do you know how many people right now are getting blown out of roles they\u2019ve had for ten years so they can train their lesser counterpart in the Philippines?

It cannot continue without causing severe harm to Americans who want and need middle class job opportunities.  Trump simply doesn\u2019t get it.  His top three labor priorities are oligarchs, oligarchs, and oligarchs. permalink award report block reply\nSuperDuperBasedMD 7 points 12 hours ago Keep in mind, although the H1b problem is real and it's very important, the reason why it's being algorithmically pushed is because it's being used as a wedge to destroy MAGA.

It's about having a mindless, compliant workforce, who will allow you to treat them like slave labor to avoid being sent back to their shitholes. Big Corporate is just as bad as Big Socialist Government. permalink award report block reply\nrebuildingMyself 3 points 10 hours ago And those low wage jobs tht used to be done by young teenagers needing money for school or (God forbid) their own hobbies are replaced by jeets. Little Billy earning money by mowing his neighbors lawns? Nah we have illegal slave labor for that now. So those young ambitious kids are denied the opportunity to build valuable skills and learn hard lessons while the cost of failure is cheap are told to shut up and study their Marxist programming instead. That way they can eventually vote for Commies like Mamdami who promise free gibs from the sky only to revoke the promise right after giving him the vote he needed. permalink award report block reply\ndtrap 2 points 8 hours ago The fact that they force Americans to train H1Bs before the Americans are replaced by H1Bs says it all. This is about long term control of wage growth. American gets in, gets 6-8 months of experience, then levels up for $5-10-k. Any employer that doesn't want to waste money on churn will pony up. The solution? H1B visa holders. Once sponsored they are stuck with their employer for 3 years. If the H1B visa holder even thinks of playing the field, the employer cancels the visa and the visa holder has 3 months to either find a new sponsor or liquidate their US life and self-deport. Visa holders stay put and accept the wages given for year or decades at a time. Docile. Controlled. The H1B visa is just moving indentured servitude up the employment chain. permalink award report block reply\nCrappydatum 2 points 3 hours ago Don't blame Trump, blame the Department of Edumacate permalink award report block reply\nATX_for_Trump 2 points 9 hours ago American's are already in these roles and are just being replaced by cheaper labor.

Positions where your company needs a very specific person for a very specific role in your company, ok.  The total number issued each year should be under 500. permalink award report block reply\nIt_takes_10_years 1 points 7 hours ago Trump disagrees with you. \"I know what MAGA wants better than anyone else\" Ingraham countered him, saying that US has \"plenty of talented people.\" Trump in response said, \"No, you don't. There are certain skills you don't have, and people have to learn them. You can't take people off the unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles.'\" America requires foreigners because Americans are too stupid!

Cool permalink award report block reply\nfrenacrossthepond 0 points 9 hours ago The same story in Europe. Large companies have lobbied to allow importation of Indian workers etc... They are only doing this to increase the size of their workforce in order to a) demonstrate \"growth\" for shareholders/stock price and b) so that a company can apply for more national and EU funding. The whole thing is a racket. In fact worker's salaries are often so subsidized by the state that the state would actually save money if the workers were fired and they would claim unemployment money instead. Many times internal company projects are started just for the sole purpose of getting more state funding and increasing the workforce numbers. Actual project - no one gives a fuck about...it will never become a product or service offered to a customer. The biggest players are the ones exploiting the system to the max...and then the ceos use every tax evasion trick to keep more money. It' called \"milking the system\" and there are many start-ups that seem designed to do just that. permalink award report block reply\nNZbacon 0 points 9 hours ago If foreign work is required then it can be done remotely. permalink award report block reply\nflashersenpai 0 points 5 hours ago But Bessent just said H1B could need 3-7 years to train workers! permalink award report block reply\nGreenhills 0 points 8 hours ago Do you know how many people right now are getting blown out of roles they\u2019ve had for ten years so they can train their lesser counterpart in the Philippines?
