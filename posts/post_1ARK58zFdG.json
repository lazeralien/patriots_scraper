Trump wouldn't have blown up dams and reservoirs. permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 9 points 4 days ago Their only other way to get fresh water is desalination. A process that requires a lot of energy, especially if you want to supply a country with such a large agriculture and pasture economy as Iran.

If they succeeded in killing Trump, you'd have Nikki Haley and war with Iran right now. When Trump was shot, they blamed Iran with 0 evidence. But, Mayorkas is a communist jew from cuba, ruled the DHS which controlled the secret service when a roof was left open right next to Trump as a patsy took a shot at Trump. The media crowned Nikki Haley as #2 right beforehand, despite no actual public support. She is a huge warhawk that would go into ANY war, especially with Iran. Weird, huh? Then Trump becomes president, and Israel tries to start the war anyway. They assassinate hundreds of politicians and public figures. Trump puts his foot down and says no because he wants to be known for peace, not war. We avoided what I claimed Israel wants by a hair. And you call it an outlandish claim?

RedStoneDeepState 4 points 4 days ago The issue is excessive dams. permalink parent award report block reply Tyndel 2 points 4 days ago And it started all the way back before the muslims took over also.  The short and mid term answer is to desalinate the caspian sea and pump water to the headwaters in the mountains just south.  But when isreal offered to help them develop the desalinization plants they doubled down on funding terror instead. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 5 points 4 days ago I wont blame Iran for not accepting infrastructure project help from a hostile foreign country, but it is a bit hilarious that the only country with the technical experts they need is their opposition, Israel and to a far lesser extent the USA. permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 1 points 4 days ago the only country with the technical experts they need its by far not the only country. Both Russia and China are more than willing to provide expertise on this. The problem with desalination is that you need obscene amounts of energy to do it on scale that matters. Iran's in a dry region and the country is big on agriculture and also pastures. So they are going to need to desalinate a whole lot of water to help offset their drained natural reservoir Guess what Iran needs for that? if you said 'a bunch of nuclear power plants' and nuclear fuel, you would be right. Now you might recall that their nuclear program has been sabotaged repeatedly by US and Israel and also someone recently bombed the shit out of their critical sites. And yeah, for Iran getting that nuclear program up and running well is a matter of long term national survival in the strategic sense. Which is why a lot of people who watch that region believe Trump didn't stop a war in that particular case but merely guaranteed one to happen soon. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

The amount of capital burned through by that decades-long project is staggering. permalink parent award report block reply Hikedelics 3 points 4 days ago I mean, they\u2019re dumb, but also I sorta get it. If I had the means I\u2019d probably have a nuke tucked in the corner of my closet. To be honest, I think most guys would. I don\u2019t think any of us have a clue as to why we\u2019d want it or what we\u2019d do with it other than \u201chave\u201d it. permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 1 points 3 days ago To be honest, it's your CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to have a nuclear weapon and it's your duty under God to make it happen. permalink parent award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 5 points 4 days ago To be fair, to do that efficiently you need nuclear power, and if they do that Israel will order America to burn $100 million+ in taxpayer dollars to bomb them. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 3 points 4 days ago Nuclear power is incredibly expensive permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 4 days ago Where are they going to get technical experts? The world leading technical experts in desalinization are all Israelis. permalink parent award report block reply DT170x 7 points 4 days ago American and the west got some desalination plants....oh wait they don't like them. Well they can get it from Temu(China) and hope it does not fail in a few years. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 4 days ago All the projects in California hire Israelis too. Besides that there really isn't much in the West. This is what AIPAC actually lobbies for - joint US Israeli programs. 80% of it is missile defense but desalinization is a large part of the other programs. China doesn't have shit for desalinization technology because their climate results in them not needing it. Most of their people live in what is naturally tropical rainforest. permalink parent award report block reply TenaciousDT 2 points 4 days ago LOL sure buddy permalink parent award report block reply NADSAQ 5 points 4 days ago maybe instead of professing to kill them all, they could try hiring them? permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 3 points 4 days ago They would need regime change and they would rather people die than regime change. permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 2 points 3 days ago My guy, they know how to get water. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 permalink parent award report block reply Tyndel 4 points 4 days ago Isreal offered to help them build them but iran refused all the way back in 2018.

It was the Ayatollah\u2019s own inept leadership. I don\u2019t think the Ayatollah regime will last much longer. permalink parent award report block reply CanadianTrump2 8 points 4 days ago I feel like thats been said now for a decade+ permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 2 points 4 days ago which again shows that the best thing Trump could have done there is just left them the fuck alone. His air strikes on the country only bolstered the political influence of the regime who's now been justified in their claims that US and Israel are an imminent threat. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora OP 10 points 4 days ago Also more devastating than the bunkerbuster bombs dropped by the Americans. permalink parent award report block reply spez_this 9 points 4 days ago The bunkerbusters didn't destroy anything of benefit to the Iranian people. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora OP 6 points 4 days ago No, but the nuclear weapon-building facilities that the bunkerbusters destroyed had cost huge amounts of money for decades, and one way or another, all that capital was taken from the Iranian people. At least the bunkerbusters put a stop to the long-running capital-guzzling project. permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 1 points 3 days ago You shouldn't arrest fentanyl dealers. One way or another, you're taxing the crackhead population and, really, is that not too unkind? permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 1 points 4 days ago of course. If your country is short on water and your only option is to desalinate from the nearby sea, why would you want silly things like having nuclear power plants. Its not like desalination is one of the most energy demanding process on... oh wait, I was reading that the wrong way around. Well, its not like fresh water is important. I am sure they will just calmly accept that they are not allowed to have any because USA says so. permalink parent award report block reply spez_this 1 points 3 days ago They weren't nuclear power plants. They were uranium enrichment facilities. A nuclear power plant operates operates on 3-5% uranium. These facilities were being used to generate weapons-grade uranium - up to 90%. BTW, you don't hide nuclear power plants 80 m underground. permalink parent award report block reply friedchicken 0 points 4 days ago israel is a mistake permalink parent award report block reply btntx 11 points 4 days ago Quick!

There is not an unlimited amount of water in the air so when water is artificially removed the passing air starts to pull it out of the ground it is next passing through.  This is why countries down weather from large cloud seeding projects are seeing changes in rainfall and climate. permalink parent award report block reply Nomad899 7 points 4 days ago Climate warming change permalink award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 6 points 4 days ago 0 fucks to give unless they try to evacuate here, in which case fuck you and stay in your desert shithole. permalink award report block reply Bldg_2019 6 points 4 days ago They can still hang faggots from cranes, right.

Both Russia and China are more than willing to provide expertise on this. The problem with desalination is that you need obscene amounts of energy to do it on scale that matters. Iran's in a dry region and the country is big on agriculture and also pastures. So they are going to need to desalinate a whole lot of water to help offset their drained natural reservoir Guess what Iran needs for that? if you said 'a bunch of nuclear power plants' and nuclear fuel, you would be right. Now you might recall that their nuclear program has been sabotaged repeatedly by US and Israel and also someone recently bombed the shit out of their critical sites. And yeah, for Iran getting that nuclear program up and running well is a matter of long term national survival in the strategic sense.
