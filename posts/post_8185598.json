Trump wants someone in the fed who will play ball, and that ain't J-Pow.  J-Pow is expected to NOT STEP DOWN from the board when his term as leader ends, which breaks from historical standards.  If J-Pow doesn't step down, the board is still full, and Trump can't appoint 'his guy' onto the fed to become chair.  That's why they're fighting Lisa Cook getting removed so hard...the fed chair has to be elected from the existing board.  By this guy retiring, Trump sidesteps the fuckery of J-Pow not retiring and Lisa Cook fighting in court, and has the vacancy to appoint, and can get who he wants as fed chair...which is YUUUUUGE. permalink award report block reply BidenSniffsLittleKid 4 points 1 hour ago Cheaper rates for my 50 year mortgage!!!
