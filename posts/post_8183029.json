YES I DO permalink parent award report block reply lothrop_evola 27 points 1 day ago Not OP, but I live in Toronto with 3 kids and my wife homeschools because she enjoys it ( when they're in a good mood, which isn't always). I support it 100% because our local schools are run by literal faggots who once put a picture of a pregnant man to indoctrinate the kids. permalink parent award report block reply imnotdeadyet 18 points 24 hours ago The funny thing is, you talk to people that home school and they only need to teach for an hour or two to cover the material the school system needs 6 or 7 hours to teach.  That gives the kids more free time to read or two other creative things. permalink parent award report block reply lothrop_evola 9 points 23 hours ago Absolutely. My wife is usually finished teaching by lunchtime and the afternoon is free to do other things permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Constantin2024 9 points 22 hours ago The reason why the schools take so long to teach anything is because they spend upwards of 80% of their time dealing with discipline problems from disruptive future criminals. And at the end of the day, when kids haven't learned anything, the teachers send all the work home with them so their parents can do it anyway. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... borisborscht 4 points 21 hours ago But then you might realize the school was wasting the kids time year after year reteaching the same material with a few more levels.  And they were wasting time teaching irrelevant material and skipping things that are important. permalink parent award report block reply MAGABOND 1 points 16 hours ago Not only do they take fucking 7 to 8 hours, but they also send your kid home with homework.

The state of Washington fought us tooth and nail they hated homeschooling.  Less government indoctrination. Homeschooling shows how easy school is for the most part, that one could do all the required work in 9 weeks or less, not 9 months. permalink award report block reply Bidensmellslikepiss 72 points 1 day ago If you send your kids to public school, they'll move at the same pace as the most retarded kid in the room - which is the teacher 90% of the time. Edit: which is a shame. Elementary school teachers used to be grade A wife material. permalink parent award report block reply 24601 34 points 1 day ago Elementary school teachers used to be grade A wife material. That's because they were wives, and mothers, before they were teachers. permalink parent award report block reply TheSwampThang 25 points 1 day ago Because being a good mother is  inherently being a good teacher permalink parent award report block reply Jack_NC 14 points 1 day ago inversely, it's also why so many \"early childhood education/development specialists\" are full of stupid ideas -- they are childless unmarried women with no experience, just repeating what they have read in books written by other barren women. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... basedboston OP 6 points 1 day ago You should have to be a mother to be a teacher.

Even in a red state in a deep red county, the leftist influence in education is too pervasive. permalink award report block reply Brookes 20 points 1 day ago Our grandkids are all homeschooled.  Our oldest son originally had them in public school then saw what they were not learning and pulled them out.  The kids are light years ahead of other kids in the same grade levels. Just after one year of homeschool. Our daughter in law takes them on field trips every week to some cool places that are educational along with being fun for all of them. I\u2019m so impressed with the job she does with them.  She follows a curriculum that is very advanced.  Since we moved to Arizona I\u2019m bummed that nana here can\u2019t go with them.  They live in Utah. But the entire herd of kids and grandchildren are coming here for Christmas! Happy old lady pede will be cooking non stop!  We are taking the kids to the Desert Museum for a field trip! permalink award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 8 points 1 day ago Woohoo! permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 5 points 1 day ago The state of MD traps kids in public school intentionally. They do not have kids at grade level, but by law as soon as parents disenroll their kids from public school if the child is not at grade level the parent goes to jail. There is no time given to get the kids to grade level. Even if the parent wants to disenroll the child for this reason. I learned this when my son who was in 8th grade at the time was diagnosed with dyslexia. This is why you see school districts like Baltimore where none of the kids are passing, but the parents still send them to school. Unless the child is sent to private school, or moves out of the state of MD the parent is held accountable immediately for the child's educational deficiency. permalink parent award report block reply ChinchillaCapitalism 6 points 20 hours ago Government schools can make it so your child is functionally illiterate while taxing you into poverty to pay for the privilege. Meanwhile, you'll go to jail for not meeting the same arbitrary standard they've never met themselves. Anarcho-tyranny. permalink parent award report block reply Brookes 2 points 23 hours ago That\u2019s insane, but everything the left does is freaking insane. permalink parent award report block reply AccipiterQ 1 points 23 hours ago leave the state. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 18 hours ago So many people want to, trust me. permalink parent award report block reply Aquamine-Amarine 4 points 1 day ago That sounds lovely. I would do something similiar, take them on field trips to museums, aquariums, local parks, etc. Is she teaching them any languages? Best time to start is when they're young, their brains are sponges! I told my brother to teach my niece our native language and he made some dumb excuse saying he didn't want to confuse her since she was lagging behind in other areas. She started school this year. Very worried about the poison teachers will try putting into her head. permalink parent award report block reply Brookes 2 points 1 day ago Yes they are learning Italian lol! Our huge ass family is obviously Italian and we visit family in Italy frequently.  The little stinkers already speak it better than most adults in our family. permalink parent award report block reply Quixotic -11 points 1 day ago You shouldn\u2019t have moved away from your grandkids. Shame on you. permalink parent award report block reply Brookes 1 points 1 day ago Dude, we moved out of California!  The kids had already left California for Utah, Texas and Arizona. The ones in Arizona are three hours from us.  We see them all the time. We\u2019re retired and hop in the RV and visit them all the time.  Or they come to us for long visits. We actually see them more now than when we lived in California! We are a very close family.  There\u2019s zero shame here.  Who are you to judge? permalink parent award report block reply Quixotic -2 points 22 hours ago You should move to Utah near them and actually support them with your presence instead of just when it\u2019s fun for you, boomer. permalink parent award report block reply Brookes 1 points 22 hours ago What about the ones in Texas and Arizona? Should we live 3 months in each state? We have always been there for our kids and their kids. You have zero clue what you\u2019re talking about. You have no right to judge us.  Our family is healthy and happy.  You have been awfully judgmental about someone\u2019s life you know nothing about.  Perhaps mind your own family kid before you make ridiculous comments about mine. permalink parent award report block reply MoreGuns 17 points 1 day ago I hope most kids end up homeschooled and public education completely collapses. The liberal tears when thousands of Communist DEI trans antifa indoctrination centers close and these \"teachers\" are left with nothing will be glorious permalink award report block reply fskfsk 16 points 1 day ago That is impressive.  The hard part is having one parent stay home to supervise the kid. permalink award report block reply MasterChief08 20 points 1 day ago There's homeschooling groups nowadays. You take turns with groups of families that can range from 3 to 20. You can also find retired engineers, nurses, etc. who will help out once the kids get into their teens and need more advanced STEM. permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 17 points 1 day ago A friend of mine teaches math and science to homeschooling pods and makes a killing just doing that part time. permalink parent award report block reply fskfsk 3 points 1 day ago How much can you make?  I can teach Math + CS well enough, but would it pay as much as my regular job? permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 7 points 1 day ago I think it would depend on the group size. He teaches small groups of up to 8 kids high school math & science and he has a bachelor's degree in math (a real degree, not one of today's \"degrees\"). I don't know the specific amount he charges but I know he only works 10-15 hours a week and he's making money hand over fist. He teaches on site but he's also done Zoom in the past, I think for one-on-one tutoring. He's not a guy to sit behind a desk all day so he loves the variety and working only part time. permalink parent award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 3 points 1 day ago This highlights everything wrong with our education system. None of our credentials teachers actually know anything. How can you expect them to be able to teach jack shit when they don't actually know anything? Meanwhile the people who actually do know something don't get to teach within the system. permalink parent award report block reply Madnote1984 18 points 1 day ago This is the struggle for my wife and I. We homeschool 4. Essentially, I am working poor. I have very low debt, a very low mortgage and our newest car is 10 years old. We get zero government assistance even though I carry 6 people in my household. I also still manage to make enough to pay taxes. No boat, no vacations. I had a leak in the guest bathroom last winter that went on for quite a while. Had to rip out the vanity and a ton of the drywall. Still haven't fixed it, because too broke...and I have another bathroom. That said, my wife has taught all of my kids to read early. I've got one that just turned 7 who reads on an 8th grade level and will be completing first and second grade by spring. So, those kinds of things make it worth every penny of lost income. I'm kind of resigned to being poor at this point, (at least until 401k time) but hopefully my kids will have a chance to do better than me. Unless the commies collapse the country. permalink parent award report block reply AccipiterQ 3 points 23 hours ago Absolutely agree, what you are doing is the proper way.  It's about your kids and their wellbeing. You're rich in that regard. permalink parent award report block reply ChinchillaCapitalism 2 points 20 hours ago You're richer in ways that most \"well-off\" families can't imagine. You get to see your kids grow up and be a part of it as opposed to seeing them for a few hours between daycare and bedtime. You'll never have to worry about them being assaulted, drugged, or brainwashed and gender mutilated at a government school. You'll get to have experiences that matter and know your actions have an eternal impact, that your values will be passed on. That's worth a lot more than any shiny toys/worldly distractions that money can buy. permalink parent award report block reply Madnote1984 3 points 20 hours ago Absolutely my fren. Thanks for the encouragement. permalink parent award report block reply electricboogaloo 13 points 1 day ago My wife stays home with our soon to be 3 kids. What I recommend to young men trying to find a path to their (future) wife staying home with the kids: Resist common vices as early as possible: video games, porn, gambling, drugs, drinking, etc Marry a woman who cooks/cleans/works hard/is frugal, and doesn\u2019t need an Instagram-worthy life to be happy. Don\u2019t \u201cfall\u201d in love with just anyone, intentionally find the right person. Work hard/smart to maximize income early. Don\u2019t waste your 20s coasting/vacationing. Don\u2019t take out massive student loans. College may not even be necessary. Teach yourself everything possible. Live way below your means even when you\u2019re way ahead. Never hold a credit card balance, buy used cars, don\u2019t buy too much house, be frugal. Buy 2nd hand, do research, and price shop. Save money to create financial flexibility. Pay for practical, long-term value. Let go of ego. Get rich slowly. Embrace hard work, pain, and discipline. permalink parent award report block reply exarch 6 points 1 day ago That\u2019s great advice for a young man, but I fear there are very few women who are marriage-worthy these days. What we need is some way to reach them and influence them to live right. Because as soon as they start \u201cdating\u201d (read: engaging in promiscuity) they are on a path that they can\u2019t come back from. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 2 points 22 hours ago I did some of these things but Covid destroyed it all. I'm trying on rebuilding now but the economy sucks donkeys arse currently. permalink parent award report block reply electricboogaloo 3 points 18 hours ago I don\u2019t have a college degree and I battle a lifelong terminal illness. I manage a client-facing, technical team of 20 people. I interview people frequently. Many guys I interview or pass over for promotions fail in 3 areas: They fail to relate to people. The bar is so low here that it makes you stand out in dating and at work if you can relate to people. Smile, take an interest in what makes a person tick, stop caring about what anyone thinks, and just talk. It\u2019s not a chess game, it\u2019s just a conversation. Many men avoid this skill, but it will take you very far. They fail at the mundane stuff. Show up on time, prepared, and with a good attitude. Go the extra mile to do the job the right way every time even if it\u2019s painful. Reply to an email on time without anyone telling you. Apply basic common sense to a problem. Don\u2019t bitch about a problem, find a solution. Own your tasks and don\u2019t make excuses. If you can own the mundane things then you will earn trust and be given more responsibility. There\u2019s a very serious leadership vacuum in this world, but nobody will make you a leader if they can\u2019t 100% trust you. They give up when they encounter roadblocks. It\u2019s very rare there isn\u2019t a way around. You don\u2019t need to be smart, strong, talented, or well connected to do these things. These are universal skillsets that are scarce in today\u2019s world, particularly post-COVID. Persist and you can work your way up anywhere, in any economy. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 1 points 15 hours ago Dayum, that's definitely inspiring. permalink parent award report block reply Geocav 15 points 1 day ago That's how we did it, it's the best investment that you can make. permalink award report block reply FLpalmtrees 2 points 22 hours ago Same here, and I completely agree! permalink parent award report block reply learntocode 14 points 1 day ago If I could go back and do it again, homeschool all the way. permalink award report block reply FloridaGirl 13 points 1 day ago Got two in my home.

But tell me again how they are \"unsocialized.\" permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 2 points 1 day ago My kids went on field trips with home school pods. I was the only adult they allowed their kids to be supervised by. permalink parent award report block reply covok48 13 points 1 day ago Elementary schools are shutting down in the DFW area because all the White kids are being pulled out and being homeschooled. It is glorious. permalink award report block reply bejeavis 5 points 1 day ago We need social distancing muh COVID! Wait, not like that! permalink parent award report block reply Jack_NC 12 points 1 day ago In the 70s, it was against the law in most places -- \"homeschooling\" your children was risking arrest and having your children taken away by The State. Bravo to those who went before us. Same to those who follow. The greatest thing about Homeschooling is the unspoken lesson to the children that they own their own lives. NO ONE gets to compel you to wake at a specific hour, obey a teacher, ask for permission to use a toilet or speak, etc. permalink award report block reply Quixotic -5 points 1 day ago That might be the dumbest list of \u201cbenefits.\u201d You think everyone should just open their mouth and start speaking whenever they feel like it? You don\u2019t think that social group settings should have norms/order? permalink parent award report block reply Jack_NC 5 points 1 day ago That's the foundation to adopting the mindset of a slave -- surrendering authority over your life to someone who doesn't have your best interests at heart. I'll put you down as \"disagree.\" edit: the other side of this is that the family owns it's time. The family doesn't have to postpone that trip to grandma's house because the school \"doesn't allow it\". We don't have to hurry through a holiday, or ask permission to study a subject more deeply, or spontaneously spend a day with a blacksmith or glass blower or cabinetmaker so the kids can learn to make something useful. (three activities my kids actually did and enjoyed immensely). They also were able to learn subjects that are useful. History and geography, not \"social studies.\" Mathematics books from the 1950s where every page isn't full of rainbow math, cartoons and stories. Literature and Grammar, not \"language arts\". And real literature, not a bunch of queer-biased propaganda and frankly, lies, from teachers with agendas. They could learn, and play, on their schedule. We also covered lessons in how to start and run a business (which they did), invest, banking, home and auto repair, etc. Practical real-life skills that are no longer taught in a school. But most importantly, the greatest value is seeing them aspire to be adults, learn the skills they need to be self-sufficient. permalink parent award report block reply AccipiterQ 2 points 23 hours ago What math books from the 50s? We may be following down your path... permalink parent award report block reply Jack_NC 1 points 20 hours ago We bought a set off ebay way back when -- it's been 30 years so they are long gone and I don't recall the specifics but if we had to do it again today, Saxon Math would be the choice. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Quixotic 0 points 22 hours ago I\u2019m all for homeschooling - but not lazy, go-out-in-public-in-your-pajamas homeschooling. Society requires order. When you\u2019re teaching your kids at home, do you let them all ask you questions simultaneously? Do you pause the lessons and make everyone wait while they go to the bathroom? Or do you impose a structure so that they learn how to behave like productive citizens? permalink parent award report block reply Jack_NC 2 points 20 hours ago Of course etiquette and manners are part of daily life. Why would it be otherwise? And yes, if my child said \"excuse me, I need to use the restroom\" of course we would pause. That is called courtesy and respect . I know you're trying to imagine a chaotic free-for-all situation where no-one learns a thing and the parents are lazy; and indeed there may be some homeschool arrangements like that. But we were responsible and dedicated a lot of energy into ensuring our kids were learning whether in a classroom type setting or hands-on, or taking instruction from others such as a blacksmith or glass blower or cabinetmaker. We made it work for us, and every family has the freedom to adopt an arrangement that works for their specific needs. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 4 points 1 day ago You don\u2019t think that social group settings should have norms/order? Spoken as a closet authoritarian. Believe It or not, people can actually regulate themselves without an authority figure standing over them. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 3 points 1 day ago Did you know the reason high school kids go to school before middle schoolers, and elementary school kids is specifically so they get home first to be able to babysit younger siblings? Even though the teenage brain would do better waking up later. permalink parent award report block reply Quixotic 0 points 22 hours ago Just because you make up a reason doesn\u2019t make it true. The reason is actually because of bus schedules. permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 18 hours ago You're an idiot. The same buses can just reverse the age order.

Raising kids at home teaching them your religion, your values and real skills along with all the knowledge the world has to offer which mostly the best of western civilization.  Not a single groomer to twist their minds.  Not a mythical horror scenario to scare them about Climate change.  .  No bullies.  No social stigma. No fads and \"everyone is doing it\" pressure. Here's my observations of homeschooled kids: They get along with all people of all generations.  I never seen a homeschool treat a younger kid like a pariah.  I've never seen a homeschool kids act \"awkward\" teenager around adults. Homeschoolers take their role in the family seriously.  They help out when needed and take responsibility for the whole family according to their development level. I dunno isn't a reply a homeschooler makes when asked a question, neither is nothin'.  Their curiosity, love of learning and wonder of the world isn't beaten out of them by lecturing teachers, factory style schools and concern for social status among peers. They are self motivated.  They are more focused.  They don't need constant validation.  A job well done a new skill acquired and mastered is reward enough. permalink award report block reply Dev404 4 points 1 day ago Your kids aren't learning much in school beyond feminist propaganda which is mostly fuck white people, fuck men, fuck America, God is for imbeciles, Allah is okay because the oppressed muslims like him, and be gay - like really, really gay and as degenerate as possible, and don't tell your parents. That's the public school curriculum from kindergarten to high school. Then from college, it's be a whore, kill your baby, demand welfare, obey the government, and don't ask questions.

Take it seriously. Plan. Borrow good ideas from a curriculum. No, your child shouldn't lead everything. No, they shouldn't decide what they're going to learn. That's what you are here for. They don't know what's important enough to know and what can be safely ignored. Home school is awesome. I'm doing it now. The \"unschool\" movement, though, is awful. It's moms giving themselves an excuse to not teach anything in the name of independence. permalink award report block reply ForgottenUsername 3 points 22 hours ago And all 5 million of them are getting screwed on taxes for a product they aren't using.

Since they never teach, the parents must do it anyway. Then the teacher is off work at least 25% of the time with a random substitute teacher. Then there are the ridiculous amounts of half days and days off. The parents that can\u2019t teach their children or donate want to will just get their children diagnosed with a learning disability. Once a child has a diagnosed learning disability the school gives up on that child. They get an automatic passing grade and they don\u2019t have to do anything. Those children don\u2019t affect the school\u2019s ratings. If you plan to have children, just expect to homeschool. You are going to teach them anyway because the teachers won\u2019t. permalink award report block reply Itaintall 3 points 22 hours ago We homeschooled all of our kids; best decision we ever made. permalink award report block reply Unboosted 3 points 1 day ago Can we get a tax break yet? permalink award report block reply Jack_NC 1 points 20 hours ago Pfffft. No way. Someone's gotta pay for the government daycare (aka \"public school\"). permalink parent award report block reply TrumpOrTreason 3 points 23 hours ago There should be absolutley ZERO money going to public schools for students who are homeschooled. Any money that a public school is getting for student's in their district who don't attend public schools, should be paid directly to the parents doing the home schooling. We need to CUT OFF the left's funding. I will be writing expose reports for California documenting who and how much money is going from Calpers, Teachers Unions and other govt. entities directly to Democrat candidates, campaigns and committees. permalink award report block reply CastrosLittleBastard 3 points 1 day ago My kids thanked me for homeschooling them.

If we had stayed in MA we'd be home schooling.  There is a based charter school in our town that we are probably going to go with.  One of the teachers actually got fired from another district for being \"too conservative\".  Anyway, what we found interesting is that since moving here, we have found TONS of home school families in our daughter's play groups.  Not like one or two, but over a dozen. permalink award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 2 points 1 day ago Good. We need strong leadership.

It\u2019s because the public schools and most areas have gotten so black and Hispanic that there\u2019s nowhere else to go.   That\u2019s why school choice in the south is becoming a more popular thing and there\u2019s charters popping up everywhere.   no amount of money will fix public schools after their past the racial tipping point.  So Florida realized that and decided to give parents vouchers for stage spending on education and pick whatever school they want to go to.  You can put it towards a private school and end up paying a lot less.   or you could put it into a charter school where they have work requirements or donation requirements from the parents that most black parents wouldn\u2019t touch with a 10 foot pole. permalink award report block reply Remember_the_Alamo 1 points 18 hours ago Finally some good news! permalink award report block reply hillaryforprison 1 points 1 day ago yet we still have to pay the same or more in taxes to fund these cult indoctrination camps.

Even in a red state in a deep red county, the leftist influence in education is too pervasive. permalink award report block reply\nBrookes 20 points 1 day ago Our grandkids are all homeschooled.  Our oldest son originally had them in public school then saw what they were not learning and pulled them out.  The kids are light years ahead of other kids in the same grade levels. Just after one year of homeschool. Our daughter in law takes them on field trips every week to some cool places that are educational along with being fun for all of them. I\u2019m so impressed with the job she does with them.  She follows a curriculum that is very advanced.  Since we moved to Arizona I\u2019m bummed that nana here can\u2019t go with them.  They live in Utah. But the entire herd of kids and grandchildren are coming here for Christmas! Happy old lady pede will be cooking non stop!  We are taking the kids to the Desert Museum for a field trip! permalink award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 8 points 1 day ago Woohoo! permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 5 points 1 day ago The state of MD traps kids in public school intentionally. They do not have kids at grade level, but by law as soon as parents disenroll their kids from public school if the child is not at grade level the parent goes to jail. There is no time given to get the kids to grade level. Even if the parent wants to disenroll the child for this reason. I learned this when my son who was in 8th grade at the time was diagnosed with dyslexia. This is why you see school districts like Baltimore where none of the kids are passing, but the parents still send them to school. Unless the child is sent to private school, or moves out of the state of MD the parent is held accountable immediately for the child's educational deficiency. permalink parent award report block reply ChinchillaCapitalism 6 points 20 hours ago Government schools can make it so your child is functionally illiterate while taxing you into poverty to pay for the privilege. Meanwhile, you'll go to jail for not meeting the same arbitrary standard they've never met themselves.

We homeschool 4. Essentially, I am working poor. I have very low debt, a very low mortgage and our newest car is 10 years old. We get zero government assistance even though I carry 6 people in my household. I also still manage to make enough to pay taxes. No boat, no vacations. I had a leak in the guest bathroom last winter that went on for quite a while. Had to rip out the vanity and a ton of the drywall. Still haven't fixed it, because too broke...and I have another bathroom. That said, my wife has taught all of my kids to read early. I've got one that just turned 7 who reads on an 8th grade level and will be completing first and second grade by spring. So, those kinds of things make it worth every penny of lost income. I'm kind of resigned to being poor at this point, (at least until 401k time) but hopefully my kids will have a chance to do better than me.

You'll never have to worry about them being assaulted, drugged, or brainwashed and gender mutilated at a government school.

Not a single groomer to twist their minds.  Not a mythical horror scenario to scare them about Climate change.  .  No bullies.  No social stigma. No fads and \"everyone is doing it\" pressure. Here's my observations of homeschooled kids: They get along with all people of all generations.  I never seen a homeschool treat a younger kid like a pariah.  I've never seen a homeschool kids act \"awkward\" teenager around adults. Homeschoolers take their role in the family seriously.  They help out when needed and take responsibility for the whole family according to their development level. I dunno isn't a reply a homeschooler makes when asked a question, neither is nothin'.  Their curiosity, love of learning and wonder of the world isn't beaten out of them by lecturing teachers, factory style schools and concern for social status among peers. They are self motivated.  They are more focused.  They don't need constant validation.

Since they never teach, the parents must do it anyway. Then the teacher is off work at least 25% of the time with a random substitute teacher. Then there are the ridiculous amounts of half days and days off. The parents that can\u2019t teach their children or donate want to will just get their children diagnosed with a learning disability. Once a child has a diagnosed learning disability the school gives up on that child. They get an automatic passing grade and they don\u2019t have to do anything. Those children don\u2019t affect the school\u2019s ratings. If you plan to have children, just expect to homeschool.

Not like one or two, but over a dozen. permalink award report block reply\nShitsbrokeyo 2 points 1 day ago Good. We need strong leadership.

Take back the schools. permalink award report block reply Repentnow 3 points 1 day ago Public education is a historical anomaly. It's unnatural. It's a complete abdication of parenting.

It\u2019s because the public schools and most areas have gotten so black and Hispanic that there\u2019s nowhere else to go.   That\u2019s why school choice in the south is becoming a more popular thing and there\u2019s charters popping up everywhere.   no amount of money will fix public schools after their past the racial tipping point.  So Florida realized that and decided to give parents vouchers for stage spending on education and pick whatever school they want to go to.  You can put it towards a private school and end up paying a lot less.   or you could put it into a charter school where they have work requirements or donation requirements from the parents that most black parents wouldn\u2019t touch with a 10 foot pole. permalink award report block reply\nRemember_the_Alamo 1 points 18 hours ago Finally some good news! permalink award report block reply\nhillaryforprison 1 points 1 day ago yet we still have to pay the same or more in taxes to fund these cult indoctrination camps.

The mom used homeschooling tactically to not report the child\u2019s whereabouts to certain agencies if I remember correctly. permalink award report block reply\nPeterThielAntiChrist 0 points 16 hours ago Homeschooled girls are more fucked up and suck better dick than catholic school girls.
