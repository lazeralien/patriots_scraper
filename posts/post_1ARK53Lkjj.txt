Here’s Claude with the same question (single response back) “No, 1995 was not 30 years ago. Since we’re currently in 2025, 1995 was 30 years ago from now, but the current date is November 7, 2025, so 1995 was actually 30 years ago this year.
Wait, let me recalculate that more carefully: 2025 - 1995 = 30 years. So yes, 1995 was 30 years ago! My apologies for the initial confusion.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​“ permalink award report block reply Psarg 6 points 5 days ago If AI just generates text it's junk but it's better if it can recognize that it needs to call an internal calculation. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 5 days ago ChatGPT: Yes. permalink parent award report block reply MAGAJuice 1 points 5 days ago Grok: Yes. permalink parent award report block reply apathy_meh 0 points 5 days ago No, 1995 was not 30 years ago.
To calculate: Subtract 1995 from the current year, 2025.
2025 - 1995 = 30 years exactly? Wait—2025 marks the start of the 30th year after 1995, but as of November 7, 2025, only 30 years and about 10 months have passed since January 1, 1995.
A full 30 years from 1995 would land in 2025, but "30 years ago" from now points to roughly 1995 (specifically late 1994 to early 1995 depending on the exact date). It's very close, but not quite there yet—1995 will be precisely 30 years ago on its corresponding dates in 2025. Grok is just as retarded. permalink parent award report block reply billhound 9 points 5 days ago To be fair, the current AI tech was and is better at creative endeavors like art and being good at linguistics and exploring ideas.

Too many ppl watching terminator. permalink award report block reply NomadicKrow2 5 points 5 days ago I'm working with an AI right now on some design specs and I check it often. I gave it the initial instructions of "Use only real world technology, no science fiction, no fantasy. Use only designs that can be built in the real world." When I check its work, I ask things like "Will this fit in my space ship?" Or "Where will I harvest the dragon blood?" So far, it's been passing. Google's AI, Gemini, is absolutely fucked from the ground up. It's the AI that was saying every ancient civilization, including Vikings, was black, and wouldn't show white people in any positive historical light. permalink parent award report block reply NeverInterruptEnemy 2 points 5 days ago It is for language, not facts.

Also, you could use some refinement in trolling, the trick is to make the insults relatable to the subject, or something you know about the person. You just sound like many of the leftist morons I come across on other platforms without a coherent thought to add, just an ad hominem, which is typically an indicator of intellectual deficiency or mental instability. Now let me explain to you how much of a complete dumbass you are. The prompt was, "Was 1995, 30 years ago?" So let me ask you this, was December 31, 1995, not part of 1995? Did the prompt specify it to be the start of 1995, no it did not, it asked how far in the past 1995 was, and the last day of 1995 was December 31st.

Ask Google if the tallest structure in sub-saharan africa prior to colonization was a termite mound.  Google will reply with this, "No, the tallest structure in sub-Saharan Africa was not a termite mound; the Great Enclosure at Great Zimbabwe, a massive stone structure, was significantly taller. While some termite mounds reached impressive heights of up to 42 feet, the Great Enclosure, constructed between the 11th and 15th centuries, stood approximately 36 feet tall and is considered the tallest structure built by humans in medieval sub-Saharan Africa."  To be fair, once you actually select "show more" and then "dive deeper in AI mode" it will come to the correct solution, so Google itself is garbage. permalink award report block reply LiteraIIyHitIer 1 points 5 days ago I couldn't remember if Nathan Arizona had 4 or 5 kids in the movie Raising Arizona , so I asked Google.
