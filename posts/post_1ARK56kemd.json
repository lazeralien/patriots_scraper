So with a grain of salt, ChatGPT answer: About 19.6% of DC\u2019s population (~ 137,500 people) received SNAP benefits monthly in FY 2024.

I am shocked my state is so low. For all you people looking to relocate, Minnesota truly is a hidden gem. Stay out of some areas of Minneapolis, but much of the state is fantastic. Parks. Recreation. Hiking. Hockey. Clean water. I had never heard of a boil order. Never had any issues with water. Lakes. Rivers. Stand up paddle boarding. Kayaking. I am never bored. And houses are cheap. And your neighbors leave you alone. permalink award report block reply DeplorableNeandertal 2 points 4 days ago Makes sense if you\u2019ve ever been there.

I am shocked my state is so low. For all you people looking to relocate, Minnesota truly is a hidden gem. Stay out of some areas of Minneapolis, but much of the state is fantastic. Parks. Recreation. Hiking. Hockey. Clean water. I had never heard of a boil order. Never had any issues with water. Lakes. Rivers. Stand up paddle boarding. Kayaking. I am never bored. And houses are cheap. And your neighbors leave you alone. permalink award report block reply\nDeplorableNeandertal 2 points 4 days ago Makes sense if you\u2019ve ever been there.
