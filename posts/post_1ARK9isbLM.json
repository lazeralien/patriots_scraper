Could have got those 3 lib judges off the bench in PA. Beat mamdani? No. Texas did pretty good I heard. Also, Amuse is retarded lately. DOGE is still going. Elon stepped away & it is still going - they just do not have anyone high profile to attack anymore. He literally just explained this virally on joe Rogan clip days ago or so. permalink award report block reply texas4ever 2 points 2 days ago That's the only reason we lose, people sit it out which is insane.

Fuck Elon permalink award report block reply tingo999 -5 points 2 days ago Elon Musk was the one that sabotaged himself. He's a faggot, sucking the tit of India and China. I know you faggots give him credit for buying Twitter, he didn't buy Twitter a group of investors did. Those investors include the original founder of Twitter Jack Dorsey and a bunch of American hating Muslims. Also, Elon bought twitter ONLY because he was fucking the young writer Ashley St Clair (Jewish) who was working at Babylon Bee (Jewish) at the time it was banned from Twitter. If they didn't ban Babylon Bee he would have never been inspired to buy Twitter. I don't give a fuck about Elon Musk. How come you retards even believe Doge is real? You think it's that easy to audit the federal government finances? gtfo here. permalink award report block reply hillaryforprison 3 points 2 days ago You're right on Elon not being 100% owner or buyer. I don't understand your hate of him though. What is that from? Is it from his unkind words to Trump previously- if so, you know they basically made up, right? Elon has retweeted and shown support in many ways since then. If your hate is based on something else- then what exactly. He has been extremely valuable to people in this world through what he's accomplished. I think your assumption about WHY he bought Twitter is wrong. He tried to back out of it after he found how many fraud accounts there were- but ultimately proceeded. This fact does not align with your assumption about being solely about a girl. You think DOGE is fake? https://x.com/doge - shows their regular progress in finding fraud. Whether something is done to shut down the abuse is up to other branches of government. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpDupedMAGA 1 points 1 day ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply\nhillaryforprison 14 points 2 days ago DOGE still exists.
