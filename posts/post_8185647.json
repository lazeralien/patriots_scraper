Targeting this latter group will make it very easy to turn America into a 80-90% White country again, and it also means that people like Letitia James, Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, etc. can be stripped of their citizenship and deported. permalink award report block reply Ostia 3 points 44 minutes ago Will never happen. We\u2019d be kicked out of power before we could even get any of it accomplished, due to flagrantly violating the constitution, the moment we started the policy of deporting legal residents and citizens. permalink parent award report block reply Elencher 4 points 24 minutes ago Then we die, and that's why the future is balkanization. If we can't make this happen through the existing governmental structures, then those structures are on borrowed time. We'll have to reform along different lines and redefine citizenship. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 0 points 21 minutes ago Yeah, man, we must destroy the constitution to save it. So much for all the constitution talk we\u2019ve spent decades spouting. permalink parent award report block reply Elencher 1 points 14 minutes ago See you're retarded like my cousin. I tried this though experiment on him. So these muslims are all given legal citizenship, and they all vote legally, and they all vote for sharia, then clearly we must accept sharia because that's the constitutional process right? No, not at all. The constitution isn't fucking magic, it's downstream of the culture. If the culture has been polluted then the constitution doesn't work anymore. Take for example the concept of jury of your peers. If your peers are blacks who will punish all whites and acquit all blacks, then does this principle work anymore? permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

You can deport illegals. permalink parent award report block reply Roadcruiser2 16 points 1 hour ago Chinese American Pede here. There are too many hostile foreigners. We need to suspend immigration. permalink parent award report block reply FusionBlack -3 points 1 hour ago My son's girlfriend is Chinese America and also agrees.

The demographics are much worse. Only thing that's better is that we aren't getting locked up for memes yet. And sure we have guns too, but that hasn't stopped the invasion. We just end up with a lot of armed feral niggrs and terrorists and that's it really. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 1 points 15 minutes ago Any and all freedoms we still have over UK will go with the next Democrat president and Congress. They see UK abusing its own people to protect invaders and get extremely jealous permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 2 points 36 minutes ago UK is just where we'll be in ten years tops. They jumped ahead of us because we bucked and elected Trump instead of Uniparty A vs Uniparty B. Trump isnt perfect by any means but one thing he did was throw a wrench in their plans to swarm the country with brown parasites. But one of our biggest cities just fell to a communist Muslim just like London fell before.  It will take a lot of work and violence to recover that city, but it's doubtful as anyone with means will flee the city in the next few years as the diversity and socialism hot their pocketbook or their faces via sucker punch. While you can point and laugh , that only means the city falls further and further to the left and we'll all eventually be subsidizing it via federal bailouts. permalink parent award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty 10 points 1 hour ago Antifa, middle east division permalink award report block reply Goatboy66 8 points 1 hour ago MOAB permalink award report block reply OldGamerGuy79 4 points 1 hour ago Mini-gun permalink parent award report block reply airborne3502 7 points 1 hour ago Glad we fought them over there so they didn't come here. permalink award report block reply ninabobby 3 points 52 minutes ago Bomb more countries!

We are cooked. permalink award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 5 points 1 hour ago FIGHT BACK. It begins by getting together a group of like-minded patriots. Start with your church and your friends and grow from there. Set up a phone tree. Use burner phones. Don't text. Organize, coordinate, think, be creative! You already know how to respond to their street-blocking \"prayers.\" Pick a name or organization and get involved. permalink award report block reply LetFreedomRing 1 points 43 minutes ago They made Christians weak by believing that Jesus would welcome everyone... What happened to people who would have fought the Crusades in this day and age?? permalink parent award report block reply MEME-SUPREME 5 points 1 hour ago This will end well. permalink award report block reply Markosis17 4 points 46 minutes ago What in the actual fuck! permalink award report block reply Formerlurker92 4 points 22 minutes ago Denaturalize and deport them anyway. Fuck foreign powers colonizing my home permalink award report block reply RBFace 4 points 29 minutes ago Why aren't these people being deported? Why are these people increasing in numbers in Texas? When Trump made his mid-east tour did he make some deal to allow and not deport these vermin? Punjeets and Muslims never seem to be the ones getting deported. There is a simple solution to this problem but our government won't do anything about it. I'm sorry,  I'm having a hard time understanding why Trump and his administration refuse to do shit about this. permalink award report block reply NutPsaki 1 points 7 minutes ago Because he\u2019s a cucked boomer pussy permalink parent award report block reply fightfightfightx 3 points 33 minutes ago thank the bergs, steins, and roths for this shit starting to think the history books were all projection, because no one today even comes close to how evil they are permalink award report block reply NutPsaki 1 points 8 minutes ago Starting to believe the exact opposite of what history books tell us permalink parent award report block reply Senaleb 3 points 31 minutes ago Don't you feel culturally enriched? permalink award report block reply RickSanchezC137 3 points 51 minutes ago Deport them all permalink award report block reply Saxonlady 3 points 51 minutes ago For years I've been told by many here that UK is a shithole. Whilst I never disagreed, I'm very sad that while some were watching what was happening here, they did nothing to stop this from also happening in America. permalink award report block reply VladtheTickler 3 points 30 minutes ago Thanks, Obama. permalink award report block reply CheeseAndOnion 1 points 19 minutes ago Well he is Moslem after all what did u expect permalink parent award report block reply Underpants 3 points 39 minutes ago Can we build a wall around it? permalink award report block reply CaptainWinston 2 points 1 hour ago Looks. AI AF permalink award report block reply GreyKnight 2 points 36 minutes ago I used to wonder why they were so many wars, atrocities and genocides throughout history\u2026now I get it. permalink award report block reply CheeseAndOnion 2 points 24 minutes ago Deport permalink award report block reply LetFreedomRing 2 points 46 minutes ago Why didn't our people fight back? Americans have been conditioned to believe that if we fight back we're somehow racist. It's not racist to want to preserve the American way of life. It's not racist to fight people who want you dead. permalink award report block reply Oleander 1 points 27 minutes ago I don't give a shit if it's racist anymore. The browns and blacks would gladly watch whites (who are a vanishing minority in this world) die. The fact that you or anyone cares whether it's \"racist\" is how we got here. The term \"racism\" is a weapon exclusively directed at whites and no one else. It is an albatross we must be free from immediately, or we will die. It's not hyperbole, the whole world and half of our own are rooting for our extinction. permalink parent award report block reply bleeje OP 2 points 1 hour ago Thanks for sticky, mods permalink award report block reply cherbui 2 points 10 minutes ago legal invasion promoted by democrat party permalink award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 2 points 18 minutes ago No reason for this. permalink award report block reply FirstOfHisName 2 points 60 minutes ago All wearing black like the good guys... right? permalink award report block reply DontTreadOnSnek 2 points 39 minutes ago It's a race between Michigan and Minnesota as to which one becomes the first caliphate state. permalink award report block reply Freefertilizer 2 points 13 minutes ago sickening permalink award report block reply Snek_Plissken 1 points 7 minutes ago 40% of those residents are in SNAP.

No, not at all. The constitution isn't fucking magic, it's downstream of the culture. If the culture has been polluted then the constitution doesn't work anymore. Take for example the concept of jury of your peers. If your peers are blacks who will punish all whites and acquit all blacks, then does this principle work anymore? permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nParhelion12 3 points 24 minutes ago Hence.... no ballot box permalink parent award report block reply\nflashersenpai 0 points 23 minutes ago due to flagrantly violating the constitution never stopped the government before, has it? and don't combine legal residents and citizens as though they have the same rights permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 1 points 22 minutes ago Uh\u2026 They do. permalink parent award report block reply\nOstia 1 points 22 minutes ago Uh\u2026 They do. permalink parent award report block reply\nFormerlurker92 0 points 20 minutes ago If theres no way to have it happen other than violence, I pray it happens while I'm still young and capable of it permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 0 points 19 minutes ago You\u2019re not even older enough to know what you\u2019re talking about, what it was like before your time, or what you think you\u2019re fighting for. permalink parent award report block reply\nOstia 0 points 19 minutes ago You\u2019re not even older enough to know what you\u2019re talking about, what it was like before your time, or what you think you\u2019re fighting for. permalink parent award report block reply\nhenri_derelicte 0 points 6 minutes ago Listen pal, you can either save your country or follow the constitution to the letter.

Trump isnt perfect by any means but one thing he did was throw a wrench in their plans to swarm the country with brown parasites. But one of our biggest cities just fell to a communist Muslim just like London fell before.  It will take a lot of work and violence to recover that city, but it's doubtful as anyone with means will flee the city in the next few years as the diversity and socialism hot their pocketbook or their faces via sucker punch. While you can point and laugh , that only means the city falls further and further to the left and we'll all eventually be subsidizing it via federal bailouts. permalink parent award report block reply\nOleander 4 points 46 minutes ago It's worse.
