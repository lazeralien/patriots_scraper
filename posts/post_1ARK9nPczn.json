Now, counterpoint - the H1B system doesn't have a mechanisms to make companies train American workers and while it does set an initial 6 year (3 years + 3 year extension) limitation on duration, there is the PERM process leading to I-140 Green cards. In 2022, India made up 74% (320k) of all H1B visas accepted and  58% (78k) of initial employment H1B visas (source: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/with-3-20-lakh-h-1b-visas-bagged-in-fy-2022-indians-continue-to-top-the-charts/articleshow/100772292.cms ) while China came in 2nd with 12% (55k). That same year, we granted 72k I-140 Green cards to Indians (that had been here multiple years)(source: https://www.adhikarilaw.com/adjust-of-status/approved-i-140-petitions-and-pending-i-485-applications-data-indicate-that-eb-2-and-eb-3-immmigrant-visa-applicants-will-still-face-a-significant-wait-time/ ).  So, roughly the same amount of of initial employment (not extensions) H1B visas and I-140 Green Cards were granted. I don't know if you can find how many I-140 accepeted applicants were H1B's, it doesn't much matter. 2022 saw 150K new Indian workers, half of which are permanent. The half that are not will be in the next few years. It may not be the exact individuals, but for each of those who leave or time out of H1B, another becomes a permanent resident. permalink parent award report block reply genericamerican69 1 points 2 hours ago This isn't india.

Now, counterpoint - the H1B system doesn't have a mechanisms to make companies train American workers and while it does set an initial 6 year (3 years + 3 year extension) limitation on duration, there is the PERM process leading to I-140 Green cards. In 2022, India made up 74% (320k) of all H1B visas accepted and  58% (78k) of initial employment H1B visas (source: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/with-3-20-lakh-h-1b-visas-bagged-in-fy-2022-indians-continue-to-top-the-charts/articleshow/100772292.cms ) while China came in 2nd with 12% (55k).

So, roughly the same amount of of initial employment (not extensions) H1B visas and I-140 Green Cards were granted. I don't know if you can find how many I-140 accepeted applicants were H1B's, it doesn't much matter. 2022 saw 150K new Indian workers, half of which are permanent. The half that are not will be in the next few years. It may not be the exact individuals, but for each of those who leave or time out of H1B, another becomes a permanent resident. permalink parent award report block reply genericamerican69 1 points 2 hours ago This isn't india.
