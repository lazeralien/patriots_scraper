And it\u2019s funny because the left has never met a third worlder that they didn\u2019t want to import which only makes these problems worse. permalink award report block reply Bigstick7 44 points 4 days ago Mass deportations and a fixing if a lot of our systems the government has corrupted. Student loans are one of them, government should be out of them. Shackling kids with debt before they are smart enough to understand the consequences. No you should have to walk into a bank like anyone else asking for a loan and ask for money and give the case as why they should and how you will pay it back. Going to be a kindergarten teacher asking to go borrow for an Ivy League school, denied here's 20k go community college. Instead we have the government handing out loans basically unfettered to anyone for anything even if they don't have a prayer of paying them back. What happened the cost of college has exploded. permalink parent award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 24 points 4 days ago And not only do they not have the life experience to understand the consequences (by design, since schools keep them immature on purpose), but they usually have every adult in their life telling them it's the only way forward and that they're trash and failures if they don't. permalink parent award report block reply that1guy1981 6 points 4 days ago Mass deportation needs to deport 10M to even blunt the housing affordability.  20M would correct it.

If they believe they are doing quality work then certainly they would have confidence in their students success. I bet a lot more vetting and scrutiny would happen. Cost of college would go down. But instead people have it on their backs for life. Too many dirtbags guiding the impressionable into worthless directions too. They know what they are doing to. permalink parent award report block reply Axiom502 8 points 4 days ago Default is one thing. Perpetual indentured servitude to fund commie think tanks is another. Most responsible graduates are making their payments but can never escape the crushing total debt and the monthly payments eliminate their ability to invest and buy into the economy. permalink parent award report block reply N14205ST205 3 points 4 days ago They also need to make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy. It's why the debt just keeps accumulating for many. They literally don't have an option to reset from a clean slate. Also, the government getting so involved in the student loan business was a catastrophic mistake. Someone has to pay for the whole thing- the government's not a charity. permalink parent award report block reply GorillaTactics 1 points 4 days ago Just have a plan for some entirely predictable consequences. For instance, every doctor, upon completing medical school, will declare bankruptcy and discharge those loans as part of a standard new doctor financial plan. Considering how long it takes them to get through residency getting paid poverty wages, and start actually making money, they will suffer little from the hit on their credit before it drops off their score. permalink parent award report block reply Nibba2 2 points 4 days ago Yeah.

What you need is no corporations, trusts or foreigners to own residential property. An individual person can own no more than 4 properties. 2 exceptions: If you build a new property these rules don't count for 35 years. This way BTR companies can operate and encourage building over rent seeking. Charitable housing. Rent must be 50% or less than market. Penalty for fraud around this is loss of the property. Ultimately homes can be good for people, or good for investors. Society needs to get priorities straight here. In the same vein we need to remove property tax on residential and I'd do something similar with farms. We need to stop investment groups living in the city owning all the farmland and ensure families can own and run these things. permalink parent award report block reply load 9 more comments... labajada 4 points 4 days ago The \"guaranteed\" student loan administration scam was happening long before the active destruction of western freedom. back in the pit, slave! permalink parent award report block reply HuggableBear 4 points 4 days ago People under 35 - 40 years old literally don't remember a time when America was American.

You don\u2019t pay for dinner before you\u2019re served, you don\u2019t pay for a haircut before the barber pulls out the scissors, you don\u2019t pay for home renovations until after services have been rendered. But for college, you pay your semester tuition up front and in full. Why does school deserve be different? Sure it\u2019s expensive, take out a loan for it. Lock in your rate before you enroll, and start paying it after you graduate. That\u2019ll keep costs down - college will need to keep costs affordable and focus on job placement and career readiness if they\u2019re ever going to expect a return on their investment in you. And college should be responsible for your job placement. You can\u2019t pay for a loan without a job. If you can\u2019t get a job, and you provide proof that you\u2019ve been applying to jobs and tried to get a job, then the college should put that endowment to good use. If they fail to prepare you adequately for the future, that\u2019s on them for not doing a good enough job. permalink parent award report block reply Bazhosh 1 points 4 days ago You pay for gas before you drive... permalink parent award report block reply ThunderSizzle 2 points 4 days ago Not with a credit card.

Bunch of assholes ruined it. permalink parent award report block reply TheAttackTitan 1 points 3 days ago This is a stupid observation. If you pay for gas with cash, you\u2019re purchasing an agreed upon quantity of gallons. If you pay with a credit card, your credit account is checked for sufficient line of credit, then the pump lets you pump as much as you want, and you get charged after the gas has been dispensed. Yes of course you can\u2019t drive before you get gas, but the gas is still transactional. College is not transactional. You buy everything up front with no guarantee of the outcome or quality of the final product. permalink parent award report block reply Bboop 1 points 4 days ago Amen permalink parent award report block reply FromNC 1 points 4 days ago Students already have the ability to shop for lower cost schools and they don\u2019t.

This is such an out-of-touch take. Im an older millennial, born early 1980s. From the time I entered school in the mid-late 80s my teachers were constantly talking about going to college, how to use student loans, how quickly student loans will be paid back with a great job post-college. My parents and grandparents, church members, every boomer I knew told us to go to college no matter what as that was the best way to be successful and have a great career.  By the time Obama came around older millennials had already graduated from college and some from grad school with tens to hundreds of thousands in debt. permalink parent award report block reply Tele_Plus 10 points 4 days ago You and I are \u201cxennials\u201d (I was born in \u201883).  The shit millennials came about a decade after us and we get blamed too because of them.  Same thing with Boomers.  My mom is a younger boomer (they call them \u201cJonesers\u201d), and  she says the hippies were the older boomers, and she was in middle school and listening to the Monkees when all that was going on. She wants absolutely NOTHING to do with the other half of her generation and has nothing in common with them. I do agree though that many of us went all in on college, but a lot of older folks forget we were told all our lives that you\u2019re basically a failure and going nowhere in life if you don\u2019t get a college degree. Also, for a good while even the most entry level office job required a college degree, didn\u2019t matter in what field, just a degree. Meanwhile the kids they shamed for not being the top of their class were told \u201cyou might as well go to the tech school because you\u2019re not smart enough to be academically successful\u201d - those people are making good money in the trades. permalink parent award report block reply HockeyMom4Trump 2 points 4 days ago I am exhausted with being divided into generations. Stop falling for the bullshit. \u201cXennials\u201d \u201cJonesers\u201d this is beginning to sound like the left gender spectrum\u2026binary, non-binary, furry. The secret to financial success?

Stop falling for the bullshit. This There are good and bad people in every generation.  It isn't the rank and file boomer that created these problems that the younger people complain about.

But it\u2019s still more nuanced than you think. I never said I was living outside my means or anything like that.  If I was going to play victim I wouldn\u2019t be on this website and hanging out with MAGA.  We aren\u2019t all occupy Wall Street types and we don\u2019t all blame the system for everything.  (Well, no, the public school system is certainly to blame for a lot, and still is, as is most of government.) This is not playing victim, it\u2019s recognizing how we were set up for failure, so we don\u2019t do the same thing to our kids.  In fact there are a lot of millennials who are MAGA for this reason.  Many, including my wife and I, are now homeschooling our kids and encouraging them to consider careers in trades, and to avoid college unless it\u2019s for something practical like nursing. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -8 points 4 days ago The shit millennials came about a decade after us Nope, you are the age of the anti war protesters under Bush.

Millenials are also known as the 9/11 generation. I am not claiming we should or should not have been involved in OIF or OEF but we overwhelmingly fought all the sandbox wars starting after 9/11. Gen x kicked it off in a big way at more of an 80%/20% split. As soon as the millenials were old enough to join the ration flipped. Yes, there absolutely were lots of millennial anti-war protesters on social media. Gen x didn\u2019t have any major conflicts to the same degree as millenials to even protest against. Boomers were more protest queens but gen-x still had the anti apartheid protests, the AIDS act ups and \u201cdie-ins\u201d, green peace, ant-nuclear, and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m missing some. Moral of the story, it makes no sense to judge an entire generation based on their losers, save it for the jokes. Millenials losers are great to dunk on for fun. As one, the opportunity is ripe. Oh, and of the full time employed cohorts,  millenials work more hours than gen-x. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... HoganT 1 points 4 days ago Ok, boomer.

Being born in the early eighties, plus having parents with the values you described definitely put you on firm footing. To be fair the start of college degree inflation originated under the Bush Jr. administration, when the utilization of GI Bill benefits  fattened the wallets of our Universities. Like anything else in life where the government is a large customer, prices go up. Back in 2008, Tulane Freeman School of business was offering an Executive MBA for $55k. It\u2019s now $100k. While seriously inflated, you could still pay that off in a reasonable time based upon the doors it would open. A masters degree in social work at the same tuition? Best of luck. The dumb degree part came later when the Obama\u2019s pushed for woke liberal arts degrees over STEM-focused ones. permalink parent award report block reply BoltCarrierGroup 1 points 4 days ago GI bill recipients are a tiny fraction of any of the money colleges receive. Only half of veterans even use a portion of their GI bill. But less than a fifth of veterans have a Bachelor's degree so it shows most don\u2019t use the entire benefit, just a portion.

For most of our lived American history, Boomers have been been the more numerous generational cohort and because of their numbers, they've never had to really struggle other than finding a new job or being drafted for the Vietnam War.  Nixon ended the draft. That generation has never known how to save or every experienced a situation where money didn't grow on trees and they got the inheritance from the Greatest Generation in more ways than one. Thus, they have no idea how misled and taken advantage of the millennials and Gen Z are.  Heck, they don't even admit the substance abuse problem, gang problem and single parent problem smacked Gen X right in the face, because the Boomers caused the sexual revolution, the proliferation of narcotics and education is the answer (that is, college) as the solution to every problem. They however went to public school went it actually taught real subjects.  College was pretty cheap up until the 1980's.  It was somewhere along that time that government started backing student loans and as the amount being backed rose, the colleges just increased tuition.  At the same time, colleges got more irrelevant and stupid along with public education.  They started teaching more and more Marxist trash and less and less of real subjects.   I think it was explained in something I read that colleges needed to hire more female professors because Boomers were insisting on equal rights for women but there weren't enough actual academic women who could teach actual academic subjects, so they started hiring women to teach Gender Theory and women studies.  This eventually morphed into gay studies, Queer studies, black studies etc.   These aren't real studies and they aren't academic.  They're marxist propaganda and there's literally no dissent among \"scholars\" who teach these studies.  It's almost pure propaganda.   In time, the political propaganda that came from the \"studies\" departments took over academia wholesale and now we're living in \"math is racist\" times. The average student walks out of college with $100 K in student loans, very little prospects for a good job and a degree in something that relies on being hired or subsidies by the government such as social work, any political marxist things, gender theory, etc. I've been hoping for this repudiation of Boomers my whole life.  I always thought, as  a Gen X woman, the moment Boomers didn't have all the clout anymore, there was going to be a seismic change in our politics.  What boomers took as unquestioned principles were going to be challenged and crash and burn.  Boomer may have been young and optimistic when they started their revolution, but they didn't accomplish anything but screw up life for everyone generation after them while claiming they were the young generation while into the 60's and 70's.  A lot of them still think they're hip and cool. The sad fact is Gen X pretty much knows this but the reality is Gen X can't do anything about fixing the problem the right way because thanks to the pill and abortion and the myth of overpopulation, Gen X has been decimated and is too small a cohort to ever really gain political clout.  It's got to come down to Gen X convincing MIllennials not to become socialists and communists. permalink award report block reply Wearyman 7 points 4 days ago Fellow Gen X here.  You hit the nail on the head.  Boomers really don't get it.  With only a few exceptions, as a cohort their entire lives they had it almost embarrassingly easy.  Despite that they embraced Communism and Socialism writ large as well as Abortion and every other leftist bullshit philosophy and through that utterly destroyed GenX physically (Through the murder of more than half our numbers) and nearly economically, by not passing on the economies and the wealth that was passed to them by the Greatest and Silent generations. GenX understands the suffering of the Z's and even the late Millennials.  We know, because we suffered at the hands of Boomers too, just in a different way.  But we are so small as a cohort we can't do anything about it. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago Exactly right.  Boomers thought they'd be honored as the greatest generation even more than the greatest generations but in reality, they are the absolute worse generation since the antebellum days before the Civil War. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 -1 points 4 days ago Why do you throw all boomer in one category?  The majority of boomers are not upper class or even upper middle class.  Most of them are working class (or lower) and experienced many difficulties.  Many boomers started with nothing.  When they were starting out, they  were hit with the 70 stagflation followed by a nasty recession in the early 80s.  There were numerous recessions after that (late 80s, early 90s, early 00s, and the big one (2008).  Perhaps boomers with money lucked out. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 3 points 4 days ago Like the average rank and file boomer had any clout to change anything.  Append the word \"elites\" after each mention of boomer and your post makes more sense. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago it wasn't elitist boomers that burned their bras and went around saying the only difference between men and women is genitals.  It was boomer women en masse.  The same ones that pushed for no-fault divorce, family courts that are way too friendly to mothers that break up families.  It was both men and women who shacked up and said \"marriage is just a peace of paper\".  Shacking up was rare and almost unheard of before Boomers decided \"marriage is a piece of paper\" and now, almost all couples shack up.  Due to the inherent instability in shacking up, the postpones marriages and having children.  Whereas a first child born to a woman historically is between 18 and 22, it's now being pushed out to age 30 and older. It's boomers that started with the push to legalize drugs, laughed at people who said the gang problem was a real problem and it was boomers that glorified and apologized for gang culture from 2LiveCrew right on up to the LA riots. Bill Clinton wasn't an elitist when as a the son of a single mom from Arkansas, he dodged the draft and told the draft official he \"Loathed the military\".   Obama wasn't an elitist when he arrived at Occidental and decided he would make friends with only communists and socialists. Hillary wasn't an elitist when she befriended Saul Alinsky. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 1 points 3 days ago It was boomer women en masse. Ok so it's boomer women.  Why blame the hard working men that were victims of no-fault divorce? BTW those guys did become elitists. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 2 points 2 days ago umm, no.  IT's was boomer men that decided they shouldn't be alcholics like their dads and instead became junkies, then alcoholics.  They started yelling that pornography was a constitutional right under \"Freedom of speech\" and then decided they need to \"test a car out on a drive before they buy it\" but left hoardes of children with loose women and walked out on their obligations. The men stopped being sober, responsible men which is what made women decide they could \"bring home the bacon and fry and it up in a pan\". Both sexes and genders of the Boomer generation failed miserably in every way and only ever looked at their own creature comforts and now in their old age, they think they've earned the respect of younger generations.  Just because they spat, ,squashed, rejected and turned their backs on their parents, the greatest and silent generations until they were thirty five years old and then started lauding them as the best thing since sliced bread, they think they should be understood and lauded now.  Bullshit!  As a generation, boomers were selfish brats that had everything great about western civiliation handed to them on a silver platter and decide to exchange it for dung worshipping gurus, nonsense books and ubiquitous porn. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... flashersenpai -1 points 4 days ago do they vote or not? are they glued to cable news or not? permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -1 points 4 days ago they've never had to really struggle other than finding a new job or being drafted for the Vietnam War ...stagflation was a fucking bitch.

If I graduated college like that with no equity at 22 like a \"normal person\" I would still have a net worth of about 300k right now at 26.

Not really. That is my net worth - real estate. I have 5 quadplexes and for each unit they rent for about 720 a month. Each quadplex cost something between 300k and 400k each. I have a house in Camden Arkansas renting for 650 a month. 15k + 30k in rennovations. I have my house in Huntsville I live in. 95k. I have 3 pieces of land, one in Colorado, one in Arkansas and one in Alabama - 75 acres in total. There is a condo in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia that rents for $650 USD a month. With our jobs I make 137k, my wife makes 86k. Granted I started working at 15 and put most of my money into hard assets. Guns. Then I took my collection down from ~300 to 60.

Its not just the left though that is trying to craft a narrative and even now when the right lies to its own base rather then simply facing the music it only emboldens the left not to let up - because every time the right lies the left will put it on blast everywhere and it bolsters their numbers. Trump is burning through political capital and is trying tp end the fillibuster because he has pretty much ruined any chance of good will with past decisions; he didn't seek out the more level headed democrats - instead he just chose to ignore them even though they still represent his people (Americans) and without the fillibuster its only a matter of time before some of the more fair-weather republicans (RINOS) see the opportunity to get rid of him; and if the midterms go poorly they will and if Trump persists trying to gaslight folks that the tough times that were expected in enacting his goals are not that bad; people are going to call bullshit and go to people offering a lie that seems better. I worry Trump isn't driving; his own admin is running itself and just letting him say shit; the project 2025 types don't always align with MAGA and don't always align with America; they'll let Trump burn for their own goals.

That would mean I could rent them for half to three quarters the going average rent in that zip code, which is fine. I'd just plan to do two instead of one. That would be a whole new business model for me. BUT THE CITY WILL NOT ALLOW IT. These are very high end, lux little structures. They're just small. It would allow me to create side yards, front yards, back yards, out of the remainder of the tiny lot. These would be charming, sought after solutions to living in the city. BUT THE DEMS HERE REFUSE TO LET BUILDERS BUILD PRIVATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. The reason for this high rent and partly the reason for high home prices is that too many cities that have potential for more housing stock just prevent new construction so that Trump voters won't move in. Blue city Dems ONLY want welfare cases to live in Philly. Anyone else risks their monopoly. I have vacant lots that are so small that I have to get variances to go higher, build taller. To replace the house that was there with the exact dimensions is not most of the time feasible on cost. It costs as much or more to build new as it was. You won't get more than you spend. But to build by right on property you own, the city won't let you adapt without going through a long expensive process requiring architects, lawyers. Philly had affordable housing built by the private market when the city allowed builders to build it. But Dems only want to be able to hand property they seize to their donors who get \"community development block grants\" that build non-property tax paying public housing that is a blight on the city. permalink award report block reply grannylovestrump 4 points 4 days ago and the worst part they don't understand is the commies are intentiionally crashing the economy to usher it in so they blame us when it is the commies and now they will bow down to their oppressors and what they thought was bad will now get worst.

You cannot enslave young people with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, requiring them to make thousand dollar a month payments through their twenties and early thirties and expect them to be able to start families and buy homes. Average student loan debt is almost $40,000.  If you graduated at age 22 with $40,000 in student loan debt, you pay $470/month until you are 32 to pay it off.  That is ridiculous. The average student loan debt for graduate school is about $88,220.  That's $1025/month, PLUS $470/month.  For a doctorate it's $250,000.  $2900/month. None of which has a hope in hell of being repaid because some fucking jeet with a fake degree he paid $1000 for will hire other fucking jeets with fake degrees. Student loans need to end NOW, the interest rate on outstanding balances lowered to zero, discharge in bankruptcy permitted, and repayment implemented by payroll deductions over the next 30 years (a $50,000 student loan with zero interest paid off over the next 30 years is only $138/month) with tax benefits for early payoff. permalink award report block reply DenturesNancy 1 points 4 days ago one must also factors in that our elected officials swear allegiance to Israel and Israel only, leaving Americans homeless and without care.  protecting Israel's genociding people around it has pushed everyone including myself into siding with the oppressed.

Ultimately homes can be good for people, or good for investors. Society needs to get priorities straight here.

Student loans are one of them, government should be out of them. Shackling kids with debt before they are smart enough to understand the consequences. No you should have to walk into a bank like anyone else asking for a loan and ask for money and give the case as why they should and how you will pay it back. Going to be a kindergarten teacher asking to go borrow for an Ivy League school, denied here's 20k go community college. Instead we have the government handing out loans basically unfettered to anyone for anything even if they don't have a prayer of paying them back.

Meanwhile the kids they shamed for not being the top of their class were told \u201cyou might as well go to the tech school because you\u2019re not smart enough to be academically successful\u201d - those people are making good money in the trades. permalink parent award report block reply HockeyMom4Trump 2 points 4 days ago I am exhausted with being divided into generations.

Being born in the early eighties, plus having parents with the values you described definitely put you on firm footing. To be fair the start of college degree inflation originated under the Bush Jr. administration, when the utilization of GI Bill benefits  fattened the wallets of our Universities. Like anything else in life where the government is a large customer, prices go up. Back in 2008, Tulane Freeman School of business was offering an Executive MBA for $55k. It\u2019s now $100k. While seriously inflated, you could still pay that off in a reasonable time based upon the doors it would open. A masters degree in social work at the same tuition? Best of luck. The dumb degree part came later when the Obama\u2019s pushed for woke liberal arts degrees over STEM-focused ones. permalink parent award report block reply BoltCarrierGroup 1 points 4 days ago GI bill recipients are a tiny fraction of any of the money colleges receive.

For most of our lived American history, Boomers have been been the more numerous generational cohort and because of their numbers, they've never had to really struggle other than finding a new job or being drafted for the Vietnam War.  Nixon ended the draft. That generation has never known how to save or every experienced a situation where money didn't grow on trees and they got the inheritance from the Greatest Generation in more ways than one. Thus, they have no idea how misled and taken advantage of the millennials and Gen Z are.  Heck, they don't even admit the substance abuse problem, gang problem and single parent problem smacked Gen X right in the face, because the Boomers caused the sexual revolution, the proliferation of narcotics and education is the answer (that is, college) as the solution to every problem. They however went to public school went it actually taught real subjects.  College was pretty cheap up until the 1980's.  It was somewhere along that time that government started backing student loans and as the amount being backed rose, the colleges just increased tuition.  At the same time, colleges got more irrelevant and stupid along with public education.  They started teaching more and more Marxist trash and less and less of real subjects.   I think it was explained in something I read that colleges needed to hire more female professors because Boomers were insisting on equal rights for women but there weren't enough actual academic women who could teach actual academic subjects, so they started hiring women to teach Gender Theory and women studies.  This eventually morphed into gay studies, Queer studies, black studies etc.   These aren't real studies and they aren't academic.  They're marxist propaganda and there's literally no dissent among \"scholars\" who teach these studies.  It's almost pure propaganda.   In time, the political propaganda that came from the \"studies\" departments took over academia wholesale and now we're living in \"math is racist\" times. The average student walks out of college with $100 K in student loans, very little prospects for a good job and a degree in something that relies on being hired or subsidies by the government such as social work, any political marxist things, gender theory, etc. I've been hoping for this repudiation of Boomers my whole life.  I always thought, as  a Gen X woman, the moment Boomers didn't have all the clout anymore, there was going to be a seismic change in our politics.  What boomers took as unquestioned principles were going to be challenged and crash and burn.  Boomer may have been young and optimistic when they started their revolution, but they didn't accomplish anything but screw up life for everyone generation after them while claiming they were the young generation while into the 60's and 70's.  A lot of them still think they're hip and cool. The sad fact is Gen X pretty much knows this but the reality is Gen X can't do anything about fixing the problem the right way because thanks to the pill and abortion and the myth of overpopulation, Gen X has been decimated and is too small a cohort to ever really gain political clout.  It's got to come down to Gen X convincing MIllennials not to become socialists and communists. permalink award report block reply Wearyman 7 points 4 days ago Fellow Gen X here.  You hit the nail on the head.  Boomers really don't get it.  With only a few exceptions, as a cohort their entire lives they had it almost embarrassingly easy.  Despite that they embraced Communism and Socialism writ large as well as Abortion and every other leftist bullshit philosophy and through that utterly destroyed GenX physically (Through the murder of more than half our numbers) and nearly economically, by not passing on the economies and the wealth that was passed to them by the Greatest and Silent generations. GenX understands the suffering of the Z's and even the late Millennials.  We know, because we suffered at the hands of Boomers too, just in a different way.  But we are so small as a cohort we can't do anything about it. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago Exactly right.  Boomers thought they'd be honored as the greatest generation even more than the greatest generations but in reality, they are the absolute worse generation since the antebellum days before the Civil War. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 -1 points 4 days ago Why do you throw all boomer in one category?  The majority of boomers are not upper class or even upper middle class.  Most of them are working class (or lower) and experienced many difficulties.  Many boomers started with nothing.  When they were starting out, they  were hit with the 70 stagflation followed by a nasty recession in the early 80s.  There were numerous recessions after that (late 80s, early 90s, early 00s, and the big one (2008).  Perhaps boomers with money lucked out. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 3 points 4 days ago Like the average rank and file boomer had any clout to change anything.  Append the word \"elites\" after each mention of boomer and your post makes more sense. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago it wasn't elitist boomers that burned their bras and went around saying the only difference between men and women is genitals.  It was boomer women en masse.  The same ones that pushed for no-fault divorce, family courts that are way too friendly to mothers that break up families.  It was both men and women who shacked up and said \"marriage is just a peace of paper\".  Shacking up was rare and almost unheard of before Boomers decided \"marriage is a piece of paper\" and now, almost all couples shack up.  Due to the inherent instability in shacking up, the postpones marriages and having children.  Whereas a first child born to a woman historically is between 18 and 22, it's now being pushed out to age 30 and older. It's boomers that started with the push to legalize drugs, laughed at people who said the gang problem was a real problem and it was boomers that glorified and apologized for gang culture from 2LiveCrew right on up to the LA riots. Bill Clinton wasn't an elitist when as a the son of a single mom from Arkansas, he dodged the draft and told the draft official he \"Loathed the military\".   Obama wasn't an elitist when he arrived at Occidental and decided he would make friends with only communists and socialists. Hillary wasn't an elitist when she befriended Saul Alinsky. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 1 points 3 days ago It was boomer women en masse. Ok so it's boomer women.

IT's was boomer men that decided they shouldn't be alcholics like their dads and instead became junkies, then alcoholics.  They started yelling that pornography was a constitutional right under \"Freedom of speech\" and then decided they need to \"test a car out on a drive before they buy it\" but left hoardes of children with loose women and walked out on their obligations. The men stopped being sober, responsible men which is what made women decide they could \"bring home the bacon and fry and it up in a pan\". Both sexes and genders of the Boomer generation failed miserably in every way and only ever looked at their own creature comforts and now in their old age, they think they've earned the respect of younger generations.  Just because they spat, ,squashed, rejected and turned their backs on their parents, the greatest and silent generations until they were thirty five years old and then started lauding them as the best thing since sliced bread, they think they should be understood and lauded now.  Bullshit!  As a generation, boomers were selfish brats that had everything great about western civiliation handed to them on a silver platter and decide to exchange it for dung worshipping gurus, nonsense books and ubiquitous porn. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... flashersenpai -1 points 4 days ago do they vote or not? are they glued to cable news or not? permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -1 points 4 days ago they've never had to really struggle other than finding a new job or being drafted for the Vietnam War ...stagflation was a fucking bitch.

I am at about 2.5 million though at 26, despite the fact that I came from a single father household that was paycheck to paycheck. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago You've done well for yourself.  I took the $100,000 number for the entire amount of debt my nieces and nephews had respectively after college. I'm not a boomer.

Not really. That is my net worth - real estate. I have 5 quadplexes and for each unit they rent for about 720 a month. Each quadplex cost something between 300k and 400k each. I have a house in Camden Arkansas renting for 650 a month. 15k + 30k in rennovations. I have my house in Huntsville I live in. 95k. I have 3 pieces of land, one in Colorado, one in Arkansas and one in Alabama - 75 acres in total. There is a condo in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia that rents for $650 USD a month. With our jobs I make 137k, my wife makes 86k. Granted I started working at 15 and put most of my money into hard assets. Guns. Then I took my collection down from ~300 to 60.

You hit the nail on the head.  Boomers really don't get it.  With only a few exceptions, as a cohort their entire lives they had it almost embarrassingly easy.  Despite that they embraced Communism and Socialism writ large as well as Abortion and every other leftist bullshit philosophy and through that utterly destroyed GenX physically (Through the murder of more than half our numbers) and nearly economically, by not passing on the economies and the wealth that was passed to them by the Greatest and Silent generations. GenX understands the suffering of the Z's and even the late Millennials.  We know, because we suffered at the hands of Boomers too, just in a different way.  But we are so small as a cohort we can't do anything about it. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago Exactly right.  Boomers thought they'd be honored as the greatest generation even more than the greatest generations but in reality, they are the absolute worse generation since the antebellum days before the Civil War. permalink parent award report block reply mav7579 -1 points 4 days ago Why do you throw all boomer in one category?  The majority of boomers are not upper class or even upper middle class.  Most of them are working class (or lower) and experienced many difficulties.  Many boomers started with nothing.  When they were starting out, they  were hit with the 70 stagflation followed by a nasty recession in the early 80s.  There were numerous recessions after that (late 80s, early 90s, early 00s, and the big one (2008).  Perhaps boomers with money lucked out. permalink parent award report block reply\nSmurfection 1 points 4 days ago Exactly right.

That would mean I could rent them for half to three quarters the going average rent in that zip code, which is fine. I'd just plan to do two instead of one. That would be a whole new business model for me. BUT THE CITY WILL NOT ALLOW IT. These are very high end, lux little structures. They're just small. It would allow me to create side yards, front yards, back yards, out of the remainder of the tiny lot. These would be charming, sought after solutions to living in the city. BUT THE DEMS HERE REFUSE TO LET BUILDERS BUILD PRIVATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. The reason for this high rent and partly the reason for high home prices is that too many cities that have potential for more housing stock just prevent new construction so that Trump voters won't move in. Blue city Dems ONLY want welfare cases to live in Philly. Anyone else risks their monopoly. I have vacant lots that are so small that I have to get variances to go higher, build taller. To replace the house that was there with the exact dimensions is not most of the time feasible on cost. It costs as much or more to build new as it was. You won't get more than you spend. But to build by right on property you own, the city won't let you adapt without going through a long expensive process requiring architects, lawyers. Philly had affordable housing built by the private market when the city allowed builders to build it. But Dems only want to be able to hand property they seize to their donors who get \"community development block grants\" that build non-property tax paying public housing that is a blight on the city. permalink award report block reply\ngrannylovestrump 4 points 4 days ago and the worst part they don't understand is the commies are intentiionally crashing the economy to usher it in so they blame us when it is the commies and now they will bow down to their oppressors and what they thought was bad will now get worst.

Look at how things are going in the UK. Who\u2019s really getting subsidized? Not regular White Britons. It\u2019s the Somalis (only 10% of them have a full time job) getting subsidized. permalink parent award report block reply\nhenri_derelicte 1 points 4 days ago The reason people want socialism is because they think they\u2019ll be subsidized.

We don\u2019t actually teach anyone history from a pro American perspective anymore. Yes, the economic factors are what making communism appealing and the desire to burn it all down, but it doesn\u2019t help that we teach the young people that it\u2019s just as good of a system (even though it\u2019s never worked) and doesn\u2019t kill people, white American men do permalink award report block reply\nFusionBlack 1 points 4 days ago Most of our ills sprout from the pampered expected lifestyles people \"demand\". Just look at the response to the SNAP cut backs. Generations now making it a lifestyle . Four kids from different breeders and the country is made to support the bad decisions of these \"victims\" as portrayed by the media. Everyone Demands a new home ,food, healthcare and a basic income even illegals and the vermin legal citizens that support them.\nI didn't ask for any help when I was destitute . I worked 2 jobs and survived on $20 a week for food. The day old bread store was a staple. If we ever had a large downturn in the economy or God forbid a war the violence would be unfathomable. Maybe its needed for a course corrector. permalink award report block reply\n2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 4 days ago I blame it all on student loans. You cannot enslave young people with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, requiring them to make thousand dollar a month payments through their twenties and early thirties and expect them to be able to start families and buy homes. Average student loan debt is almost $40,000.  If you graduated at age 22 with $40,000 in student loan debt, you pay $470/month until you are 32 to pay it off.  That is ridiculous. The average student loan debt for graduate school is about $88,220.  That's $1025/month, PLUS $470/month.  For a doctorate it's $250,000.  $2900/month. None of which has a hope in hell of being repaid because some fucking jeet with a fake degree he paid $1000 for will hire other fucking jeets with fake degrees. Student loans need to end NOW, the interest rate on outstanding balances lowered to zero, discharge in bankruptcy permitted, and repayment implemented by payroll deductions over the next 30 years (a $50,000 student loan with zero interest paid off over the next 30 years is only $138/month) with tax benefits for early payoff. permalink award report block reply\nDenturesNancy 1 points 4 days ago one must also factors in that our elected officials swear allegiance to Israel and Israel only, leaving Americans homeless and without care.  protecting Israel's genociding people around it has pushed everyone including myself into siding with the oppressed.  Israel is rich, powerful and does not need our taxpayers money to have free Healthcare, free college, and free universal welfare.  I want my tax money to stay in the US and help OUR people first.  Trump's approval has gone way down and the Republicunts are in free fall.  I don't want to keep voting republican just because, and I don't want to vote for the demons.  where does that leave me?  not vote at all?  Trump and the GOP must think very hard about answering the above questions, because come 2026 and 2028, if those are not answered, people will just sit it out or decide to just vote democrap to speed up the downfall.  I tired of being played around with at every election just to see the person I voted for make backroom deals or declare that helping Israel is commanded by God. permalink award report block reply\nGottaSitStand 1 points 4 days ago We need merit-based immigration, not a lottery. With quotas (zero) for hostile countries and fewer restrictions, with no cap on visitors from Poland, and even a simple migration process for Polish people. There is value in having great companies formed here in the USA, but we need more people coming here who are culturally similar to European Americans and share our values. permalink award report block reply\njonnyuno 1 points 4 days ago Again, blue hellholes voted for communists.

Always a socialist until you get a job and start making your own money. Stop buying so much shit. Live within your means. No one needs a $45 water bottle and an expensive car payment. People have lost their minds to consumerism. No one needs a $34.95 apple slicer from William Sonoma. For years we\u2019ve plucked apples from trees and eaten them simply by taking a bite. permalink award report block reply mav7579 0 points 4 days ago This\nPeople worry too much about impressing others.\nWant the standard of living of someone who started out in the 50s?

It\u2019s called starting out. My parents struggled. My grandparents struggled. When you look at life compared to life, young people today have it pretty damn good. My mom and dad had to work their asses off. My dad worked three jobs and was never home when he was young. He worked his day job. Came home, ate a quick dinner (no Door Dash) and then he went and worked mopping floors and cleaning buildings. Then on the weekend he had another job, Every young person sees years and years of struggle and hard work and assumes that came easy. Oh look, grandma and grandpa have a nice house and boat! Waahhh!
