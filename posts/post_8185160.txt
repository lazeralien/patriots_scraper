I had insurance briefly under Obama. The first insurance that didn't have insane deductibles was about $580 a month for a single person. Such a scam. permalink award report block reply AllisterTwo 2 points 3 hours ago Same boat, last year when I checked for a plan without an insane deductible and prescription coverage it was over $1500 a month for just me, with no pre-existing medical conditions!!! With those premiums and the still significant deductible I would need a second full time job at $15/hr just to pay for Obamacare after all is said and done!!! permalink parent award report block reply Dev404 4 points 4 hours ago That's every government program. They don't do anything that doesn't line their pockets with money. permalink award report block reply TerrorAndSlaughter 4 points 4 hours ago Never doubt that ceasing to dump in billions in tax dollars won’t instantly cause prices to drop. The insurance companies will raise their prices, normies will be shocked, paid shills will guide the narrative toward reopening the tax sluice, and rinos will fold. We need to nuke Obamacare first. permalink award report block reply ganachain 3 points 4 hours ago This is the scam distracting from the other scam.  Everyone arguing about insurance and the expense of "healthcare" when the western medical system is DOA.  You don't want to be paying into a system that is actively trying to kill you slowly while taking all your money.  You want out of that system. permalink award report block reply Lib_Women_Have_HSV 3 points 4 hours ago I've been pointing this out for years. Go look at Athena or any other Healthcare stock before obamacare. They were selling for $7-$23 and are not at $200+ permalink award report block reply CocaineNewsome 3 points 4 hours ago I thought the original plan was to collapse the healthcare system and force public insurance. In the meantime it was to do exactly this, require people to buy insurance, fleece both them and the government. It's a thousand page bill nobody read. Even with the fine, it was way cheaper than any premiums. permalink award report block reply starjello 4 points 4 hours ago Of course. It was written by the insurance companies. Big insurance companies worked in collusion with each other. permalink parent award report block reply CocaineNewsome 3 points 4 hours ago We cannot afford to govern this way. permalink parent award report block reply captflerbus 2 points 4 hours ago you left the step out where the money goes back to politicians pockets from the ins/pharma companies permalink award report block reply IvIA6A 2 points 3 hours ago What happens when you subsidize things? That's right, prices go up. Food, rent, education, healthcare.. permalink award report block reply hansgruber7 2 points 4 hours ago It's not just insurance companies.
