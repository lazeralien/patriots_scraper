16 I would wager that the people on this site completely abandoning Trump because they claim he has forgotten his promises (because he's making some missteps) are the same short memory traitors that still support Pro-sports kneelers because "muh... reasons". posted 5 hours ago by redditadminssuckit 6 comments award share report block Hey doomer dumbasses... Complaining about Trump missteps on a 50 year mortgage or H-1B or China is just fine, but stop acting as if Trump has played us or has some evil or selfish intent just because he may be making mistakes in some areas. If you're abandoning him, GTF off this forum.

I've been around long enough to know that today's crop of Zoomer-llenials are no differrent in their lack of impulse ccontroland overly performative reactions as their lefty counterparts. They just use less weird hair dye. Back on the old Freerepublic fourm we had people write "vanity posts" where they gave their corny opus about the same (crashing-out in 2025 lingo) and they would leave for about 5 months until they signed back up again. These days they all need to let us know theor fee fees 24/7, and they NEVER LEAVE. permalink award report block reply GarbageLivesMatter -1 points 4 hours ago I have noticed that, all of a sudden, people are quickly turning.
