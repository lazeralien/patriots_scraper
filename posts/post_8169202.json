Thank you for the clarification. permalink parent award report block reply modded 4 points 7 days ago We are at war and one side just posts snarky messages on twitter. permalink award report block reply learntocode 3 points 7 days ago In 1996 congress passed, and Bill Clinton signed, the Telecommunications Actof 1996. The law repealed all sorts of ownership restrictions on media companies - and we have seen the results ever since. The cable internet corporation owns the cell phone, the newspapers, the magazines, the book publishing, the radio station, the TV station, the movie studios, the video game company - literally everything is owned by corporations, that are themselves owned by corporations, that are themselves owned by large pools of hedge fund and retirement fund money - very very important companies in the public life of a nation, controlled by very few people. The deregulation that happened in 1996 with the Telecommuncations Act really set the stage for the horrific trash we call \"media\" these days. Add on top of that the disastrous repeal of Glass-Steagall (restrictions on commercial banks getting involved in retail bakning) - and you have Money Power just laying waste to this country.
