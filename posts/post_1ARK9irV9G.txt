He plays duck, duck, goose with them while saying The Lord’s Prayer over their prayers.  He lets them know that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.

If they didn't, they'd be arrested. Also, I think it's great that there are people who are willing to preach the gospel over them when they are praying. If they don't want to be harassed, they can go to a mosque.  Don't let this praying outside anywhere thing become a "tradition" in America. permalink award report block reply YT45 9 points 2 days ago Muz don’t belong here. permalink award report block reply KarenLukasik 8 points 2 days ago Almost 70,but I might now be pregnant! permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 4 points 2 days ago 🤣 permalink parent award report block reply dukeofdoorcounty 4 points 2 days ago he forgot to mention goat fvcking permalink award report block reply NoticesBugleOWO 3 points 2 days ago They simply aren't going to understand that sort of logic.

Maybe you're right, though!
