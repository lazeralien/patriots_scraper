54 60 Minutes ran a story that Margaret Atwood's book The Handmaid's Tale was banned for sexual content. They spun the story that conservatives banned it, leaving out the real story of the LGTBQ Trans grooming books that were the real cause of the ban. posted 17 hours ago by tingo999 1 comments award share report block 60 minutes been running these flipped stories every week. Pushing Anti-Republican, Anti-Conservative, Anti-Trump propaganda that is essentially twisted or spun to the point of being fake propaganda. It's insane. I hate this shit. Here's what the 60 minutes story was based on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsMsAMY4eM It's completely flipped leaving out the reality of why the ban was created in the first place and it just happened that her book was caught in the crossfire. It's also not ironic it happens to be the Handmaids Tale that they spin the controversy. They love that story so much. P.S. People on this forum guilty of the same gaslighting. I know this forum isn't a secret private club exclusive to people true to MAGA.
