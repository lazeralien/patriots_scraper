When the Feds want uniformity nationwide this is how they accomplish it.  The usual example is back in the 80s trying to establish standard highway speed limits across the country.  They withheld highway funding from Wyoming(?) Montanta(?) maybe both because those states didn't want to set speed limits on some of the long cross-state stretches with little traffic. I get the need for standardizing some things, ATC is one of those things.  But not allowing states to control speed limits because it screws up some DC central planning egghead scheme is over the line. permalink parent award report block reply keeman 7 points 6 days ago And the reason this works is that the fedgov suddenly discovered in the 1930s that the \"general welfare\" clause (which the founding generation intended as a limit on taxing power) was actually a grant of the power to spend money on anything they like.  The game is to raise taxes to drain money out of the states only to give it back to the state governments with strings attached.

The government shouldn't be involved in this at all. This is a major problem and completely retarded. Regulating the air space - fine good that's the role of government. Staffing airports with ATC staff - well outside the scope of government. permalink award report block reply Agenda47 11 points 6 days ago The ATC was federalized in 1941 after a few high profile fatal crashes including one where a Senator was killed. Non-standardized weather reporting and competition between airlines was blamed. But following standards doesn't mean they had to be literally run by the government. The USA was all for implementing grand centralized psuedo-commie bullshit back in the 30s-50s, peaking with FDR. (iirc that is when the idea of agency \"czars\" arose) The FCC is another one where they said they needed to control the airwaves to avoid frequency interference but it was centralized primarily to control propaganda. permalink parent award report block reply USDMaga 10 points 6 days ago So you are telling me nothing was done by fed govt until a Senator was harmed. This seems to be a repeating pattern.  I think the solution to all our problems is make sure a senator is inconvienced by whatever causes us problem, it appears to be only way to make them act. permalink parent award report block reply WhatTheActualFuckS 5 points 6 days ago That\u2019s unfortunately how the majority of the country works. Even around here. Until it personally affects them they don\u2019t care. permalink parent award report block reply RockFlagAndEagle2020 4 points 6 days ago Government - NEVER LET A GOOD DIASTER STOP YOU FROM EXPANDING GOVERMENT. Seriously fuck these people. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 3 points 6 days ago The federal government is involved in subsidizing virtually every form of transportation infrastructure. Federal dollars go towards building/operating airports. Federal money is spent building and maintaining roads and highways. Taxpayer dollars are spent improving railroads. And taxpayers are on the hook for port authorities. Taxpayer money for internal improvements was such a contentious issue that during the Civil War, the Confederate Constitution had language restricting money towards infrastructure projects permalink parent award report block reply thisisatestof2 2 points 6 days ago Exactly. The government can create some regulations to make sure all the aircraft controllers follow the same rules and procedures. However, each airport would be required to actually staff it. Problems solved. permalink parent award report block reply Hanrahan 13 points 6 days ago Get ready for the next wave of Tik Tok videos of stupid young women complaining about how difficult air travel has become. permalink award report block reply TheMostUselessFeeder 8 points 6 days ago And you have the MSM spewing 24/7 that THIS IS TRUMPS FAULT!!! too. Mark my words, democrats are legit hoping to take this shutdown past Christmas. They want to cause hardship and unrest, hopefully riots, and especially hopefully more would-be tranny assassins going after Trump. permalink award report block reply btntx 5 points 6 days ago I\u2019ve been saying exactly this. They need another cat-5 chimp out to sway public opinion. permalink parent award report block reply dukeofdoorcounty 6 points 6 days ago There are hundreds of white AT controllers that didn't get hired because they were white.  Maybe allow them to work. permalink award report block reply gorilla_grip 5 points 6 days ago I got family coming in for thanksgiving from 4 different states and bought several of them airline tickets. I\u2019m going to be really pissed if their flights get cancelled.  I was ok with driving past some national parks I wanted to go to last month that were closed, but not being able to spend thanksgiving with my kids is going to hurt. If this means the death of the democrat party and the abolishment of the TSA and giving the responsibilities of ATC and others to private companies and local municipalities then it will be worth it though. The feds have their hands deep in this stuff and we still had airports using floppy disks and other outdated tech. We need to keep shrinking the federal government permalink award report block reply MisterMAGA 5 points 6 days ago 10 percent reduction permalink award report block reply Badfinz_FL 4 points 6 days ago That's not much in the grand scheme permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 5 points 6 days ago \"planes will fall out of the Sky - before we vote to re-open government.\" -- Some Dem, probably. permalink award report block reply armyofpedes4usa 5 points 6 days ago Privatize Air Traffic Control. Even freaking Canada has done this. permalink award report block reply Freeth3usa 1 points 6 days ago Canada went to a nonprofit. The FAA was In the process of doing this between 2016-2018 when his administration squashed it. permalink parent award report block reply Lol_Garrus 4 points 6 days ago Why are air traffic controllers and security (TSA) not hired by the airport itself instead of the federal govt? permalink award report block reply geckogreen 4 points 6 days ago That's a really good question considering an airline pays the airport like $3000 a flight. Even more for international flights and bigger airplanes permalink parent award report block reply Freeth3usa 1 points 6 days ago Because the majority of controllers do not work for an airport. Most controllers don\u2019t work in towers that you are thinking of. permalink parent award report block reply Lol_Garrus 0 points 6 days ago Not my point.

Kind of an odd narrative to try and push for an obvious mechanical failure where the engine burned off the wing -- but their voters are low-IQ, low information anyway. permalink parent award report block reply chinigga 3 points 6 days ago AI will replace the ATC in 10 years. permalink award report block reply RusherOfDin 3 points 6 days ago Flying is a miserable fucking experience these days so it's a shame for people who have to be somewhere but if you're just flying for pleasure you are punishing yourself for no reason. permalink award report block reply godgoldnguns 3 points 6 days ago Fine - dock back pay by 10% when the shut down ends. permalink award report block reply Ryunnsun 3 points 6 days ago Sounds like time to privatize the airlines again. permalink award report block reply ThePatriotGames2016 2 points 6 days ago yeah, fuck the government airlines. 9/11. the government takeover of the airlines. permalink award report block reply RizzlieDoodad 2 points 6 days ago Nah man this isn't the Dems anymore.

Pleade just long enough for the mass firings permalink award report block reply Snowdone 1 points 6 days ago It\u2019s quite simple.

Let them delay or lose their flights, they deserve it.

The government shouldn't be involved in this at all. This is a major problem and completely retarded. Regulating the air space - fine good that's the role of government. Staffing airports with ATC staff - well outside the scope of government. permalink award report block reply Agenda47 11 points 6 days ago The ATC was federalized in 1941 after a few high profile fatal crashes including one where a Senator was killed. Non-standardized weather reporting and competition between airlines was blamed. But following standards doesn't mean they had to be literally run by the government. The USA was all for implementing grand centralized psuedo-commie bullshit back in the 30s-50s, peaking with FDR.
