In a bad economy, people who used to eat at 'better' restaurants moved 'down' to fast food. In a good economy, people who never ate out moved 'up' to fast food. At $15 for a big mac meal, no one is moving 'up' or 'down' to fast food.  They are moving 'down' to microwave food, and 'up' or laterally to dine in restaurants. permalink parent award report block reply imnotdeadyet 5 points 5 days ago Exactly.  I can go to a restaurant and get better food for the same price.  I stopped by a Jack in the Box and ordered a large Diet Coke and it was $3!  Fast Food used to be fast and cheap.  Not anymore! permalink parent award report block reply SPEDMan64 3 points 5 days ago Right. I can get an order of fajitas with rice, beans, and guac for the same price as a Wendy's combo from any of the Mexican joints near me so why wouldn't I get that over a bunch of processed crap? permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 4 days ago I've noticed this as well. You can get more food at Mexican restaurants for about the same price as fast food these days. Even places like Denny's are fairly pricey now. On the subject of Denny's, they kept their egg premium cost addon long after the prices of eggs came down. The cost of eggs dropped quite a bit by the second month Trump was in office, but they kept the premium charge for meals with eggs through most of the Summer months. I'm not sure if that was political or greed or a combination of the two, but it was definitely a put off. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... FrmrAmericanRepublic 3 points 5 days ago Couple price increases with declining quality and even the most obese fuck that loved McDonald's will stuff their faces with something elsewhere. I'd rather have a burger at a local joint that processes it from a farm less than 20 miles away than go to some fastfood shack where some attitude-laden Sheniqua chucks my burger in a container with her never-cleaned talon-length nails. permalink parent award report block reply Gfloydvotestrump 2 points 5 days ago It's absolutely outrageous. I just made an entire box of spaghetti with meat sauce for dinner, combined everything wasn't even 8$ at the store and I can eat this numerous times. Big Macs, hell fast food in general isn't worth the wrapping paper/box it comes in permalink parent award report block reply CPT88 7 points 5 days ago Not sure what the threshold of high income is but I'd probably be that. My family used to use McDonald's as a quick option every few weeks or so when things were busy. Now we never go near it. It's no longer quick, that's my biggest gripe. You watch the movie The Founder and you realize that was a key USP and they have completely lost that. And now you have to wait plus prices are up and quality is down, you may as well go to a local takeout for far better food. There's no reason to go there any more other than the inertia of the brand. Plus even in that mass franchise space there's now so many options, but we mostly hit owner run local places now for far better food. permalink parent award report block reply Tbonius45maximus 5 points 5 days ago Flavor brought to you by sysco permalink parent award report block reply Nibba2 1 points 5 days ago Trump loves McDonald\u2019s. permalink parent award report block reply BeefFarmerForTrump 22 points 5 days ago Everything is falling into place. In Demolition man, Taco Bell was a fine dining establishment. I found it hilarious as a kid watching the movie but now I'm seeing it happen. Soon, only the rich will be able to afford it. I've been saying for a while and I've seen other people say it too, but we truly are heading for a combination of a Demolition Man/Idiocracy future. permalink award report block reply RedFoxOnFire 6 points 5 days ago \"What kind of kids eat Armour Hotdogs?\" \ud83c\udfb6 permalink parent award report block reply TearsAficionado 5 points 5 days ago SHUT UP!

Not counting fraud, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re not going to fast food as much because they actually have to pay for their own groceries now, so that\u2019s taking up their prior McDonald\u2019s budget permalink parent award report block reply Surfsup 4 points 5 days ago Good, no real food permalink award report block reply OZYMANDIAS1939 3 points 5 days ago Wages are stagnant and inflation keeps going up... tough times man. . permalink award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 3 points 5 days ago They use doordash via SNAP.

A meal at McDonald\u2019s can be as expensive as an affordable sit down restaurant meal in tourist areas like Vegas and Honolulu. McDonald\u2019s shit food used to be cheap and fast.  But there is no reason to visit anymore permalink award report block reply ProfessorJagoff 1 points 5 days ago The problem is, if you're going to jack up the prices you have to make damn sure the product is always fresh, warm, consistent, etc. something they just can't seem to do in my area anymore. Furthermore, and this isn't a complaint against Hispanics in fast food, the drive-thru taco place in town is phenomenal and I eat there almost every other day, but I've noticed that the employees at my McD's are all hispanic now, but unlike the taco place they just don't really give a damn about their job. For example, the last time I was there, and the last time I will be there, I ordered a chicken deluxe sandwich with a new gold sauce, which also has bacon and veggies. What I got was cold soggy chicken between two smashed buns. and most importantly, NO SAUCE, the meal is literally named after the special sauce. So I went inside and to my surprise, they were shocked I came in to complain, and that about set me off. A supervisor came over and corrected it, and the next sandwich I got was amazing, as it should have been. permalink award report block reply Keep_on_Trumpin 1 points 5 days ago Now how the hell do they know whether a customer is low income or not? Are they paying for their McDouble with pocket change or something? permalink award report block reply LibsRcrazy 1 points 4 days ago McDonalds is batshit crazy if they think a rubber McMuffin is worth $7.00 permalink award report block reply Texasnumber1 1 points 5 days ago Even if they brought the prices down I will never eat their food ever the only Burgers I would probably eat from a fast food chain would be Whataburger and Dairy Queen and I haven't had those in a couple of years permalink award report block reply MAGANatsFan 1 points 5 days ago How would they know? permalink award report block reply LLP2 1 points 5 days ago Does that finally mean the end for the \"celebrity\" meals like Stormzy, Travis Scott, and Angel Reese meals? permalink award report block reply HanginChad 1 points 5 days ago Amazingly I don't hear of anyone starving.

Not counting fraud, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re not going to fast food as much because they actually have to pay for their own groceries now, so that\u2019s taking up their prior McDonald\u2019s budget permalink parent award report block reply\nstjimmy92 1 points 5 days ago Only the elderly, disabled, or homeless are supposed to be in the EBT program allowing it to be used for prepared food.

A meal at McDonald\u2019s can be as expensive as an affordable sit down restaurant meal in tourist areas like Vegas and Honolulu. McDonald\u2019s shit food used to be cheap and fast.  But there is no reason to visit anymore permalink award report block reply\nProfessorJagoff 1 points 5 days ago The problem is, if you're going to jack up the prices you have to make damn sure the product is always fresh, warm, consistent, etc. something they just can't seem to do in my area anymore. Furthermore, and this isn't a complaint against Hispanics in fast food, the drive-thru taco place in town is phenomenal and I eat there almost every other day, but I've noticed that the employees at my McD's are all hispanic now, but unlike the taco place they just don't really give a damn about their job. For example, the last time I was there, and the last time I will be there, I ordered a chicken deluxe sandwich with a new gold sauce, which also has bacon and veggies. What I got was cold soggy chicken between two smashed buns. and most importantly, NO SAUCE, the meal is literally named after the special sauce. So I went inside and to my surprise, they were shocked I came in to complain, and that about set me off. A supervisor came over and corrected it, and the next sandwich I got was amazing, as it should have been. permalink award report block reply\nKeep_on_Trumpin 1 points 5 days ago Now how the hell do they know whether a customer is low income or not?
