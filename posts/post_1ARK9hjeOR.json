I literally draft purchase agreements for these types of acquisitions on a daily basis. Yes, PE firms acquire companies/utilities/everything under the sun by getting institutional investors to commit money to an investment vehicle. But the billions of dollars we're talking about for these purchases can't all be called up in a flash. So PE shop takes out a subscription facility with a big bank that is secured by the commitments the investors made and makes the actual purchase with the borrowed money. The debt is often paid back within a year but may be drawn in similar scenarios later on. Investors are not buying a piece of a company where all the revenue goes to paying back debt - that is ludicrous on its face - and the negotiated purchase price almost always includes paying off any existing debt the company already had. permalink award report block reply corntortilla 1 points 2 days ago So an investment firm is investing in utilities?

Woody Allen and Mia Farrow's son(maybe Frank Sinatra's)  is not someone I look to for sane commentary. Using capital to buy a company is about as normal as anything else done in the course of business.  Using that acquired company to acquire other companies is totally normal as well.  That is what happens when you sell an asset....the new owner gets to use it as they see fit.  If I sell you my car and you take out a title loan on it to buy another car.....that's none of my business.  If a utility is private and can sell it's assets, that is not much of the business of it's users.  I recommend using a cooperative utility....they are much better for stability....but they still have to buy energy from someone else too. permalink award report block reply Awakened 2 points 2 days ago He does a great job here.
