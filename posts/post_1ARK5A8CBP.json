Carlson said he wanted to debate, but Levin responded by chickening out and calling him a \"Nazi promoter.\"\n33 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save KuzoKevin 41 points 3 days ago Levin can fuck off. permalink award report block reply cyberrigger 5 points 3 days ago Levin is cringe permalink parent award report block reply cyberrigger 3 points 3 days ago as his bullshit gets deeper ---- his volume get louder permalink parent award report block reply FusionBlack 33 points 3 days ago Tucker is more popular than ever. Levin's time is over except in the eyes of the old guard.  He would never debate Tucker as he is a self severing shill. permalink award report block reply imnotdeadyet 22 points 3 days ago I'm old and stopped listening to Levin years ago.  His shilling for Israel got unbearable.  Hannity is the same.  Hell, everyone from Fox News shills for Israel. permalink parent award report block reply AppalachianTactical 2 points 3 days ago Dont forget Shapiro.\nHe is one of the worst and most egregious examples of a traitor to the country he was born in and tries to speak for. permalink parent award report block reply imnotdeadyet 1 points 3 days ago Yep, his is one little Faggot Weasel! permalink parent award report block reply Patrick_Bateman 10 points 3 days ago Man talk about living in a bubble.

Of course, if Rush were still alive today it would be interesting to see where he'd come out on all this controversy.  Rush was his own man and he was not a slave to the Zionist Murdoch's.  Hannity has just become the controlled opposition shell of himself since he caved on so much principal after the 2020 election.  I ceased listening to and watching him from that point forward after having been a loyal listener where he followed Rush since he began with Fox in 1996. permalink parent award report block reply I_Am_John_Galt 18 points 3 days ago I cracked up watching Levin, Shapiro and others try to take ownership of MAGA and say Tuvker isn't MAGA and hes an antisemitr and they are MAGA and get to decide who is in and who isn't.  It's like they haven't paid attention over the last 10 years that name calling, finger pointing, premade signs, etc does nothing but make us laugh at them. permalink award report block reply bobbacringo 4 points 3 days ago There's more jews than those ones trying to make themselves the face of MAGA. That ugly harpy Laura Loomer is one. permalink parent award report block reply AppalachianTactical 6 points 3 days ago Yep. We honestly might have to face up to most of our leadership being MIGA.

But dual loyalty has meaning ... permalink award report block reply AppalachianTactical 1 points 3 days ago Dual loyalty implues they have dual loyalty and arent just lying avout loyalty to rhe US. Ben Shapiro and Levin and Loomer and the like have loyalty only to Israel. Shapiro has said as much thar his loyalty to the US is because of what it mwans to israel aka no loyalty. permalink parent award report block reply Spellmonger 3 points 3 days ago I wish President Trump would fire Pam Bondi and put Matt in charge of the DOJ as interum AG. permalink award report block reply ythehorses 2 points 3 days ago Everything that Levin says here, can be applied directly to himself. No one listens to him, or cares what he says or thinks. He is anti-freedom of speech, and that ends him. He is totally irrelevant. Also, anyone that shares private texts to \"get back\" at someone they don't like is a piece of trash, as well as a high school girlie child. permalink award report block reply patrioticwinning3 2 points 3 days ago MAGA Matt for AG! permalink award report block reply Grindelwald 2 points 3 days ago Levin knows where his money comes from.  He hated Trump from 2016.
