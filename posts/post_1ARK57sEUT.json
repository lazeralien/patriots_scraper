Both Teen Vouge and Wired have laid of something like 70%+ of their staff in the last few weeks.

FAFO for all involved. permalink parent award report block reply Gletkin 3 points 4 days ago Awesome permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 4 points 4 days ago At least four from this little REEE fest got fired.

(Pedos will downvote me) I do agree, however, on your term \"terminate them\", but in a much different context. permalink parent award report block reply Filo76 23 points 4 days ago I heard the tranny a mile away. permalink award report block reply couranto 12 points 4 days ago He was shitcanned. Avalle wrote on X, \u201cI love my job, I love my coworkers, and I love my union. I\u2019m devastated the company made this move. There are so few trans women in media at all \u2014 particularly ones who aren\u2019t confined to \u2018Queer Media\u2019 \u2014 and I was incredibly proud of what my position at Bon App\u00e9tit meant at large. She added, \u201cMore important to me than my identity, I am also the Vice President of the NewsGuild of New York, and targeting me with a blatantly retaliatory termination like this feels like an egregious shot against our union and against media workers as a whole.\u201d permalink parent award report block reply GodSaveTheWest 10 points 4 days ago He* permalink parent award report block reply Nick-Kerr 3 points 4 days ago Union.

It's basically daycare for trannies. permalink parent award report block reply Chuj 16 points 4 days ago Careful. The tranny might go postal on the office. Dangerous permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 6 points 4 days ago Win/win! permalink parent award report block reply f_bastiat 3 points 4 days ago I was genuinely getting anxious watching that, you can't turn your back on people like that. permalink parent award report block reply Chuj 2 points 4 days ago You are correct! In clinic, the computers face away from the patients, so if type on it with them my back may face the transgender patient. I contort to watch them through peripheral vision. Safest that way permalink parent award report block reply Psarg 1 points 4 days ago They convinced him to cut his dick off to sterilize him and use him as a political tool. They usually don't go postal because the embarrassment of that is so huge they just commit suicide. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_Orange 3 points 4 days ago I'm curious what percentage of trannies actually cut their dicks off. It seems that, based on their weak character in the first place, it's more of a dress-up fad with a fake soft voices than anything else. permalink parent award report block reply Chuj 3 points 4 days ago I disagree. They go back to the schools that disrespected their mental disorder, and shoot them up. Pure postal permalink parent award report block reply hnoble444 14 points 4 days ago They want the anal sex guide back. permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 6 points 4 days ago We're DONE with that shit! - Emperor Hegseth permalink parent award report block reply HunterBidensPC 12 points 4 days ago No remorse for him because he had a climate and lgbt department in the first place.

No say on hiring woke nutters to be \"journalists.\" permalink parent award report block reply RustySheckelford 1 points 4 days ago Imagine having sympathy for someone who willingly takes the most universally hated job in history. permalink parent award report block reply GodSaveTheWest 4 points 4 days ago I mean if we are going to take back our culture thats exactly what we should be doing, taking their jobs from them and enforcing our own beliefs. Conservative giving up power is how all of this has happened in the first place. Take it back by infiltrating like they did. permalink parent award report block reply VirTW 10 points 4 days ago Doesn't look like they are working to me permalink award report block reply Alldayeveryday 10 points 4 days ago Stop letting these retards do this dumb shit.

In what world and what universe has Teen Vogue EVER mattered to ANY administration?  These people actually believe their own bs. I cannot imagine living a life where I am that clueless. It's f'ing teen vogue. permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 4 points 4 days ago Well, they are gay, so... permalink parent award report block reply MakeAmericaVapeAgain 5 points 4 days ago look at how these idiots solve problems. they were raised to complain until they get what they wanted, except that isn\u2019t how the world really works. so they show up as a group believing that more numbers equals more power. they are told no, and they get mean and pissy. we are dealing with spoiled brats that have very little going for them. permalink award report block reply Mike_Hoxbigg 4 points 4 days ago I can't imagine anyone wanting to work with that faggot tranny. That voice alone and tone of utter entitlement -- fire it, from a cannon, into the sun. permalink award report block reply s27zw7M1h62lURPyezOa PRO 4 points 4 days ago Subscriped to Wired back in the day that is was not a woke rag.  Can we not have one single tech publication that is not woke.  Does anyone know of one? permalink award report block reply FredRedd 4 points 4 days ago Agree totally that once upon a time, mags like Wired and Mondo 2000 (dating myself again, ain't I?)  were once really great mags, but that was a long time ago. permalink parent award report block reply s27zw7M1h62lURPyezOa PRO 2 points 4 days ago Is there any tech publication that is not woke?  What do you read for tech? permalink parent award report block reply DemPanicAtTheDisco 3 points 4 days ago \u201cAny organization that is not explicitly right-wing will eventually become left-wing.\u201d Conquest's second law of politics permalink parent award report block reply noPTSDforMePlease 4 points 4 days ago Here's more context because our mods are gay and sticky stories that have no context: https://deadline.com/2025/11/conde-nast-fires-staffers-teen-vogue-1236609695/ permalink award report block reply JesusTheOnlyWay 4 points 4 days ago This stuff is why I'm moving into a 'nothing' small town, to live quietly and serve God and raise my son and spend time with my wife I don't want to even be 50 miles within hearing about this degeneracy permalink award report block reply DingleBalls 3 points 4 days ago \"-justice\" = \"make laws to force degeneracy on everyone\". permalink award report block reply GottaMemberMyPW 3 points 4 days ago \u201cWhat are you gonna do to stand up to the Trump administration?!\u201d Good grief. permalink award report block reply jrhicksjr 3 points 4 days ago Slack-Jawed Faggots?

Go be gay somewhere else! permalink award report block reply HillarysBeaverMunch 3 points 4 days ago Teen Vogue exists solely to pollute your 12 year old daughter by pushing deviancy and degeneracy nonstop, as per the agenda of the Khazar masters. permalink award report block reply Nick-Kerr 3 points 4 days ago And sons. They are grooming both sexes permalink parent award report block reply BidensfullAFdiaper 3 points 4 days ago So much soy.

Or is that too capitalist for you? Or would the fact that would entail some hard work that requires you in the office for more than 4 days a week? Lord knows I'm hardly in the work-ethic range/capability of Donald Trump, but this pussified, entitled attitude spikes my blood pressure bigly. permalink award report block reply CasuallyObservant 3 points 4 days ago Reminds me of that newly opened Portland Lesbian bar/coffee shop (was back in 2022) that was a special meet-up place for gay women only - (no men allowed - except trans men).  It was cleverly decorated, had a bunch of nice menu items and hired only lesbians for this one-of-a-kind niche business. It did well for a whole four days before the entitled workers presented the owner with a list of demands, including expecting an ownership stake (!) and demanded that it be turned into a 'queer worker-owned cooperative' and educational center for far-left activities, rather than a for-profit business. (They failed to realize that wait staff, bussers, and kitchen help have no special talent or immutable characteristics that can't be replaced within the day). The owner, who already had a couple of other successful restaurants and 'regular' coffee shops simply closed the place and changed the locks.  Sometimes that's all you can do. permalink parent award report block reply Mike_Hoxbigg 3 points 4 days ago I remember that! I shook my head and laughed, \"I give them a week.\" 4 days later... permalink parent award report block reply raptormissle 2 points 4 days ago Of course a violent tranny was instigating the confrontation. These companies deserve the shit they put themselves in. permalink award report block reply RyanKeyOh 2 points 4 days ago Good. The entitlement is insane. Do your fucking job. Be an activist on your own time. permalink award report block reply ingrowntoenail 2 points 4 days ago They all sound like mealy-mouthed faggots. permalink award report block reply Tookens 2 points 4 days ago That's because they are all mealy-mouthed faggots. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 2 points 4 days ago HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! permalink award report block reply SuperHonkey OP 2 points 4 days ago HO LEEE SHIIIIIIIIIIT!!! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea83 STICKIES IN ONE DAY!!! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Which one of you mods is homo for me?? \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18 permalink award report block reply me-no-likely3 2 points 4 days ago Could you imagine having to work with such insufferable faggots? permalink award report block reply JimmyRussler 2 points 4 days ago Skinny jeans on a dude should be enough to admit to the nuthouse. permalink award report block reply CasuallyObservant 3 points 4 days ago Gay.

In the real world, which is everything opposite of what you were taught in school is true, your boss is your boss and he doesn't owe you a paycheck. permalink parent award report block reply taytaytay 1 points 4 days ago SAM, SAM, you said they were going to be fired in this post SAM but Patrick Bateman didn't see it in the video.

It did well for a whole four days before the entitled workers presented the owner with a list of demands, including expecting an ownership stake (!) and demanded that it be turned into a 'queer worker-owned cooperative' and educational center for far-left activities, rather than a for-profit business. (They failed to realize that wait staff, bussers, and kitchen help have no special talent or immutable characteristics that can't be replaced within the day).

It was cleverly decorated, had a bunch of nice menu items and hired only lesbians for this one-of-a-kind niche business. It did well for a whole four days before the entitled workers presented the owner with a list of demands, including expecting an ownership stake (!) and demanded that it be turned into a 'queer worker-owned cooperative' and educational center for far-left activities, rather than a for-profit business. (They failed to realize that wait staff, bussers, and kitchen help have no special talent or immutable characteristics that can't be replaced within the day). The owner, who already had a couple of other successful restaurants and 'regular' coffee shops simply closed the place and changed the locks.  Sometimes that's all you can do. permalink parent award report block reply Mike_Hoxbigg 3 points 4 days ago I remember that!
