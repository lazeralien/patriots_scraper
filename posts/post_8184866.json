The C.R. reopens the government under Biden's last budget. Rand Paul again voted against it.  Be aware. Every Republican blow-hard who originally bloviated about Biden's budget and now voted in favor of it is lying to you. Why do people not understand simple things like this? permalink award report block reply stealthboy 6 points 7 hours ago Who cares?  It's all one big uniparty.  None of this matters. permalink award report block reply PhantomShield72 4 points 6 hours ago It's the only thing that matters in terms of where this country is headed, but people would rather watch grown men play schoolyard sports than focus on the people destroying their lives. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 5 points 6 hours ago They WANT to lose so they can sit in the background and complain about how Democrats are destroying everything and to send them money. It's clear they aren't MAGA and what happened was essentially a populist revolt that took over the leadership of the party, but the Uniparty RINOs are riding coattails when talk is cheap (campaigning) but refuse to go along with anything when it is time for action. What is needed is more than just winning the presidency, which in the current system just means RINOs joining the other side just enough to prevent proper bills from going forward or activist judges stalling everything with bullshit rulings. It requires a Congress full of MAGA and zero tolerance for RINO bullshit. As we saw in South America it takes more than an election victory. It required dismantling the cancer in the judicial branch, for example. permalink award report block reply BobrobC 4 points 6 hours ago Thats what happens when you put your faith in people.
