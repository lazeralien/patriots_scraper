What did the muslim say after that? Provide a link to the full speech... I tried to locate and couldn't find it... permalink parent award report block reply chargebeck23 2 points 5 days ago It was hard to find but here it is: https://youtu.be/3dvU47eInK0?si=obwx59fzgUwz_uvD&t=252 permalink parent award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 2 points 5 days ago Great work! Impressive that you found it... I had various AI looking for it with no luck... I doubted its existence and suspicious of why it was difficult to find, as in, the rest of the video drove a dark narrative that overshadowed the Huckabee sentence(s). The full context of the entire video supports the claim that Suleiman doesn't specifically advocate for replacing the US Constitution with the Quran. That's a semantic win for you and others that challenged the editing of the clips. Can you explain what he means in the last couple of minutes in the video where he says, \"Muslims should be offering number one is that in order to see Sharia for what it truly is you have to see it represented in totality not aspects of it. Surely there are aspects of it that are being implemented in several Muslim countries but never do you see the Sharia as a whole being given okay and although we we acknowledge the good things that will come from many different governments around the world the very idea of having a monarch to implement Sharia contradicts Sharia in and of itself okay so having an unparalleled unquestioned authority contradicts Sharia itself because Sharia has embedded within it checks and balances and so that's the first answer that we have to be able to give is that Sharia is a full system it's not exactly democracy it certainly has within elements of taking the opinion of others and those types of things in you know in consideration when implementing it on a state level but at the same time we don't see today any government that is implementing Sharia in totality and so it is not our responsibility to defend those governments policies rather we only answer to what the Sharia stands for...\" Explain this: \"Sharia is a full system, it's not exactly democracy it certainly has within elements of taking the opinion of others and those types of things in, you know in consideration when implementing it on a state level...\" Specifically curious about the part \"...implementing it on a state level...\" How is this compatible with the US Constitution when \"they\" only answer to what Sharia stands for?

They are just being stupid.   When they come as migrants to North America, their children will become apostates.   Their faith will become as diluted as it is with Christians in the US.   They'll get invaded by feminism, abortions, homosexuality and more. permalink award report block reply Seeker_17 7 points 5 days ago Yes, 24% of them apostatize, acc. to Pew studies. And 75% of converts leave within a few years. It seems without migration, their religion would fizzle out over here as not even their overall fertility rate, which is just around replacement level, is high enough to compensate for this. permalink parent award report block reply dawah_destroyer 4 points 5 days ago This is why they want to build their own insular mega communities. The children apostatize, specifically the women. One of the problems with Islam is polygamy, which leads to incels. So the religion is designed to handle this problem in a number of ways. Arranged marriage of minors, allowing men to be sexually promiscuous without sin, encouraging inbreeding, and of course the 72 virgins. This is the only reason men don't apostatize as often as women. permalink parent award report block reply TwoArizonaPedes 4 points 5 days ago Muhammad definitely designed his cult to appeal to barbaric men. permalink parent award report block reply Duckanddodge 18 points 5 days ago Do they want to die? permalink award report block reply fskfsk 24 points 5 days ago No, they want YOU to die.  If some of them die in the process of trying to kill you, that's an immediate reward in heaven. permalink parent award report block reply D__1 8 points 5 days ago That depends on how much pigs blood you have... permalink parent award report block reply DT170x 5 points 5 days ago Joke on them For each Breath that a Muslim inhale.

Indeed, the only way for guaranteed salvation, i.e. going to 'paradise', is by dying in jihad. So doing this shit is a win-win for them. If they achieve what they want here, they win. If they die pursuing it, they win. Islam is a dangerous ideology, not a religion, and it needs to be banned. permalink parent award report block reply MedicallyReddit 7 points 5 days ago Actually, yes. They think they get rewarded by allah in heaven. But only after they complete their mission, which is to first kill the infidels. permalink parent award report block reply BidenShowerDrool 5 points 5 days ago it's a death cult. they believe that that the next life will be the \"best one\". permalink parent award report block reply LeeHarveySirhan 16 points 5 days ago There will be blood. permalink award report block reply Beardholder 5 points 5 days ago Hits fast forward button permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 1 points 5 days ago There wasn't blood in that movie. permalink parent award report block reply blueeyephoto 15 points 5 days ago if that's the case, they cannot legally hold office here as they swear to uphold and defend the Constitution. permalink award report block reply BidenShowerDrool 13 points 5 days ago Takiyya allows them to say whatever they want and since no-one is pulling them up on their bullshit they will keep on manifesting into Koranic demons spouting their diseased book as the future for America. permalink parent award report block reply BlackPilledMAGA 10 points 5 days ago You know how many scumbags in government have taken that \"oath\" and done nothing but attack the constitution? The problem is the \"oath\" is unenforced. There are no consequences for breaking it. Like, ZERO. Tolerance = Death. The end of America will be because we sat back and tolerated far too much in the name of kindness or goodness or whatever you want to call it when you \"live and let live\" with mental illness and evil ideologies like Islam. permalink parent award report block reply Anon1970 1 points 5 days ago Tolerance is the virtue of a man with no convictions. permalink parent award report block reply blitzstrasse 12 points 5 days ago No fuckin' chance.

It's blasphemy and should be rejected outright and burned upon contact. There is no turning ge other cheek on this, it calls for the kind of absolute Old Testament devastating action when these forces manifest themselves. Any overt attempt at Islamic proseltyzing should be met with the kind of violence they wish upon non-believers. permalink award report block reply EdBuck 5 points 5 days ago It's been past ti.e to start 86ing those that say this shit permalink award report block reply DefKon1 5 points 5 days ago Well, I believe in the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Then Christians can become good little muslims and submit to Sharia.  I highly suspect this will be the false religion that was shown in the Revelation of John. permalink award report block reply Seeker_17 5 points 5 days ago This is a clear threat to national security.

Coordinating a push like this requires planning and resources. \"I think there is a resurgence of anti-semitism, because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural. And I think we are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the centre of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.\" -Barbara Spectre on Israeli TV permalink award report block reply Tiger5468 0 points 5 days ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink parent award report block reply\nTiger5468 0 points 5 days ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink parent award report block reply\nKpak76 -2 points 5 days ago Just to be fair, the first guy was taken out of context here.  You can tell what he is saying is spliced. His full statement can be found here https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2025/07/11/omar-suleiman-an-edited-clip-about-me-has-gone-viral/ permalink award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 2 points 5 days ago Granted..., few seconds taken out of context, but where is the full video for complete context? Transcript? Anything? The article is all about the clip NOT a full explanation of his speech nor video, interview, whatever! I want to see/hear the entire video/speech! What else did he say that gives context one way or another of the entirety of the video/speech? Genuinely curious... I tried to find it but nothing comes up, just the clips... permalink parent award report block reply Kpak76 1 points 5 days ago I'm not doubting the guy is a douchebag that wants Sharia law, but we shouldn't take quotes out of context when we complain the media does the exact same thing to us. permalink parent award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 0 points 5 days ago The full context of the entire video supports the claim that Suleiman doesn't specifically advocate for replacing the US Constitution with the Quran. That's a semantic win for you and others that challenged the editing of the clips. Can you explain what he means in the last couple of minutes in the video where he says, \"Muslims should be offering number one is that in order to see Sharia for what it truly is you have to see it represented in totality not aspects of it. Surely there are aspects of it that are being implemented in several Muslim countries but never do you see the Sharia as a whole being given okay and although we we acknowledge the good things that will come from many different governments around the world the very idea of having a monarch to implement Sharia contradicts Sharia in and of itself okay so having an unparalleled unquestioned authority contradicts Sharia itself because Sharia has embedded within it checks and balances and so that's the first answer that we have to be able to give is that Sharia is a full system it's not exactly democracy it certainly has within elements of taking the opinion of others and those types of things in you know in consideration when implementing it on a state level but at the same time we don't see today any government that is implementing Sharia in totality and so it is not our responsibility to defend those governments policies rather we only answer to what the Sharia stands for...\" Explain this: \"Sharia is a full system, it's not exactly democracy it certainly has within elements of taking the opinion of others and those types of things in, you know in consideration when implementing it on a state level...\" Specifically curious about the part \"...implementing it on a state level...\" How is this compatible with the US Constitution when \"they\" only answer to what Sharia stands for? permalink parent award report block reply Kpak76 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community filter. permalink parent award report block reply\nCapoditutticapi1 OP 2 points 5 days ago Granted..., few seconds taken out of context, but where is the full video for complete context?
