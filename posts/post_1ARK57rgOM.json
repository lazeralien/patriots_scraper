Tyson chicken famously lobbied the USDA/FDA to pass vaccine mandates on chickens that cost them 10's of millions a year because they knew that market competitors couldn't afford the cost. It drove many of them out of the market.

I would strongly prefer it to be de-regulated to the primal level for beef -  chuck, rib, loin, round, flank, plate, brisket, and shank - and for hogs shoulder, loin, belly, and leg.

To be clear, I don't buy ground beef when I am in 3rd world countries for this reason. permalink award report block reply utfanx2 2 points 4 days ago Should of included the whole body in the 2nd and not just arms.
