You can see what id happening in real time. Ukraine has been provoking Russia and murdering Russians for the last 10 years. People are deliberately ignoring this, as well as the fact that Zelensky has suspended elections, outlawed political opposition, attacked the church, and stole billions of dollars. The same people that call Trump a dictator (and you a fascist for supporting him) are fawning over Zelensky. permalink parent award report block reply BaronFalcon 0 points 2 days ago Really? How do?

Good enough. permalink parent award report block reply Prussian_Pepe 0 points 2 days ago commie assholes like you simping for them here. The Soviet union fell 34 years ago. Russia isn't communist anymore. It's a capitalist society. Why are you repeating cold war idiocy like the MSM? The soviets are gone. "muh communism" America is more socialist than modern Russia. Look at the 2000+ government agencies. SNAP ect. all communism. American corporatism is worse than the soviets ever where. Nearly every single problem this country faces is because of a government control, and regulations and authority. permalink parent award report block reply IAmTheScience -12 points 2 days ago No. There is nothing good about Russia. Not now or in the past. Read a history book. Putin and his friends have raped Russia and stolen anything it had of value for themselves. The people have very little chance to succeed and prosper. Human Rights are a joke to them. Two countries can both be bad. For example, in WW2 both Germany and Russia were bad. permalink parent award report block reply SenorTrumper 9 points 2 days ago Thanks for demonstrating how simpleton's think. permalink parent award report block reply Prussian_Pepe 1 points 2 days ago It's like I turned on the MSM, and heard boomer bob tell me about how "muh russia" is the bad. permalink parent award report block reply Prof_Smith 1 points 2 days ago Haha.

When he convinced Trump to shutdown during Covid?  When he brought that obvious fed plant Fuentes on his show to promote him?  He is a fraud. permalink award report block reply flp999 -4 points 2 days ago Better and more important question: how come no one in Congress, and not Tucker Carlson either, will acknowledge that it’s the U.S., particularly the CIA, that run Ukraine and set every policy in the country? It’s not an anti-Christian thing. It’s an anti all religion thing. It’s the same classic New Man/New Society scheme that’s been run in every totalitarian play since the beginning of the 20th Century. Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Polpotism, etc. Tucker is such an agenda tool with his little misdirection bullshit. Child of the CIA, child of the financial overlords that run the deal and reside in his beloved Socialist country Sweden. permalink award report block reply NoticesBugleOWO -7 points 2 days ago Absolute retardation.

hansgruber7 -3 points 2 days ago Go ahead and downvote but Tucker Carlson is not on our side.  Remember when he was best friends with Hunter?  When he weirdly said something got mailed to him and disappeared?  When he didn't report on the laptop or election fraud?  When he convinced Trump to shutdown during Covid?  When he brought that obvious fed plant Fuentes on his show to promote him?  He is a fraud. permalink award report block reply
flp999 -4 points 2 days ago Better and more important question: how come no one in Congress, and not Tucker Carlson either, will acknowledge that it’s the U.S., particularly the CIA, that run Ukraine and set every policy in the country? It’s not an anti-Christian thing. It’s an anti all religion thing. It’s the same classic New Man/New Society scheme that’s been run in every totalitarian play since the beginning of the 20th Century. Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Polpotism, etc. Tucker is such an agenda tool with his little misdirection bullshit. Child of the CIA, child of the financial overlords that run the deal and reside in his beloved Socialist country Sweden. permalink award report block reply
