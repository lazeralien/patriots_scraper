Mayors can't arbitrarily hand out free shit or raise taxes and the city council has to vote on it. NYC council districts are multi-billion dollar feifdums unto themselves. mamdani is gonna be a lame duck on everything except direct policy even with most of them being democrats.

Unfortunately as we\u2019ve seen when it comes to crime and homelessness/ drugs etc they can have a large impact by telling police/DAs not to do their jobs.

So the economy grinds to a halt as everyone either flees or turtles down to weather the storm.

At the end of the day, that communist dork is just a mayor. He doesn\u2019t have the ability to pull off 1% of what he said he\u2019d do.

I'm thinking it is not going to be a good time for them because they won't be able to use the media or the coveted race card.   They are just going to have to take those ass beatings, or worse.

Mayors can't arbitrarily hand out free shit or raise taxes and the city council has to vote on it. NYC council districts are multi-billion dollar feifdums unto themselves. mamdani is gonna be a lame duck on everything except direct policy even with most of them being democrats.

Unfortunately as we\u2019ve seen when it comes to crime and homelessness/ drugs etc they can have a large impact by telling police/DAs not to do their jobs.

So the economy grinds to a halt as everyone either flees or turtles down to weather the storm.

At the end of the day, that communist dork is just a mayor. He doesn\u2019t have the ability to pull off 1% of what he said he\u2019d do.

(assuming they were sincere at any point) Mamdani isn't an islamist, he's not after sharia law, and anyone saying so has War on Terror brain rot or is trying to sell you a narrative for their own purposes. He's a cookie cutter shitlib who just assigned a whole bunch of female shitlibs to office. permalink award report block reply"
