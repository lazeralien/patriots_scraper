Due to the multi-party system, formation of coalition cabinets existing out of parties who've been in politics for decades and have been sucked into the Dutch swamp over the years too. Just check out the recent parliamentary elections on October 29th. It seems highly likely we're going to end up with a homosexual swamp slime ball as a primer minister for the coming years ...

MasterChief08 23 points 3 days ago He needs to threaten to veto all CR bills unless Republicans revert the filibuster back to the original version. Republicans will freak out if Trump says he's going to basically keep government closed forever as there's no way they can ever achieve a 2/3rds majority. Demographic replacement and election security are all that matter. Address those 2 problems and leftists can never win again. The Senate needs to give us those 2 things. Otherwise they need to all start fearing the right wing base. permalink award report block reply TrumpWonByALandslide 8 points 3 days ago In that case, enough Republicans will vote for the Democrat bills.

See last week for more details. permalink parent award report block reply MasterChief08 20 points 3 days ago The solution is obvious. A Republican senator needs to bring a lawsuit against the Senate accusing the modern filibuster of neutering Congress as a coequal branch. The constitution makes it clear that a simple majority passes a bill. Changing it to 60% has completely destroyed the legislative branch. The old filibuster rules were not a vote.  It was just rules about how long a debate can last. The Senate can't independently decide 60 is the new 51. permalink award report block reply SpeekFreely 14 points 3 days ago Clearly the Rs don\u2019t care about election integrity.

The GOP isn't going to do it, Trump knows they will not do it, and Trump is ok with that. This is all a show and it is just a bone for the base to keep them interested. Do not fall for this empty shit. The GOP is scum. The only answer is a 3rd party. It is the only way to destroy the GOP. Remember these words: The Left will never be defeated unless the GOP is destroyed first. permalink award report block reply ImYourHuckleberry24 6 points 3 days ago Sorry, but these endless capitalized posts making demands with no results is beyond tiresome anymore.

Interesting filibuster bill-killing successes:\n1891 - Federal Elections Bill\n1922 - Anti-lynching Bill\n1934 - Anti-lynching Bill\n1942 - Anti Poll-Tax Bill\n1946 - Fair employment Practices Bill\n^^ all Bills killed were attributed to Southern Democrats However,\n1970 Amendment to Abolish the Electoral College (introduced by Bayh - D) was killed via Thurman - D, who believed it would alienate minorities (because he needed their votes?). permalink award report block reply mikejones 1 points 3 days ago Trump is full on panic mode. Suggesting 50 year mortgage rates and other stuff not good like $2000 per person. Knowing Trump the business man, I won't be surprised if Trump is what accelerated the globalists plans by setting him up in so many traps he couldn't escape without looking bad. permalink award report block reply MaBaker 1 points 3 days ago And how easily could it be turned over later? permalink award report block reply friedchicken 1 points 3 days ago They are psychopaths.

Shut up. permalink parent award report block reply tiamat 1 points 3 days ago Simply because the vast majority of Republicans are feckless cowards, it's probably best to leave the filibuster alone. If they got rid of it, they'd have to actually press the advantage for all it's worth to ensure the demons don't get back to power permalink award report block reply bluewhiteandred 1 points 3 days ago is there a way to nuke the filibuster and then like nuke their ability to nuke it in the future permalink award report block reply Meddlesom 1 points 3 days ago GOP doesn't have the votes to nuke the filibuster.

Republicans regularly lose by 5-10% in blue cities without even campaigning at all. we let Democrats beat us this time by running candidates pretending to be conservative, or even ex Republicans. we let people forget the golden Ishtar that was literally standing on top the nyc courthouse, the satanic inverted rainbows everywhere, the Easter speech, pregnant men.    we let the achievements get soft pedaled.  one ny businessman just shut down the illegal migration to a trickle, blew away the Iran threat as a side project, same way as he pulled NKs teeth last time, proved the U.S.A. wouldnt die without free trade. we need to be on the ground locally with the energy of this one old man. permalink award report block reply Araket 1 points 3 days ago Let me guess, 8 more people arrested for deportation.

Nuke the filibuster, them put it back in place and make rules changes require 2/3 of the Senate. Pass everything you want before you change the rules. Now there's nothing to complain about, and nothing for Dems to do other than whine. It won't happen, because the weaksauce changes Republicans put in place will show exactly why nothing gets improved when they take over. They just want to go downhill with the brakes on half-heartedly. permalink award report block reply HoganT 2 points 3 days ago It won\u2019t happen because it can\u2019t happen. The rules of the senate are decided by each new senate and no previous senate can constrain a future one. You\u2019d need to change the constitution. You might want to actually learn how things really work before opining on them like you have any idea whatsoever what you\u2019re talking about. permalink parent award report block reply d_lock 0 points 2 days ago Fair on future Senate rule changes -- a subtlety I'd missed. Doesn't change the underlying issue that politicians have spines made out of water, and they would show exactly that if they were given the opportunity to fix long broken policy. I've seen them bend over backwards for decades (probably centuries to be honest, I just haven't been around that long) to leave those problems in place and kill bills to fix things in committee, all while they claim they're \"really trying\" to do something this time. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 0 points 3 days ago Oh please. The GOP doesn't want this either. permalink award report block reply Executarian2 -3 points 3 days ago He's screaming into a void. It's stupid to eliminate the filibuster, and shouting online isn't going to change it. None of the senators actually want to remove it because it only benefits Trump. permalink award report block reply mailinvoter 2 points 3 days ago Wrong! It benefits our Constitutional Republic, legal citizens, voters, and our tax dollars. It doesn't benefit the establishment RINOs and demonrats, but I'm sure you already knew that. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 0 points 3 days ago Not true, but either way, it doesn't matter, because it isn't going to happen. permalink parent award report block reply mailinvoter -2 points 3 days ago You're not true.

A Republican senator needs to bring a lawsuit against the Senate accusing the modern filibuster of neutering Congress as a coequal branch. The constitution makes it clear that a simple majority passes a bill. Changing it to 60% has completely destroyed the legislative branch. The old filibuster rules were not a vote.  It was just rules about how long a debate can last. The Senate can't independently decide 60 is the new 51. permalink award report block reply\nSpeekFreely 14 points 3 days ago Clearly the Rs don\u2019t care about election integrity. More fraud was witnessed just days ago, and no mention of it. permalink award report block reply\nTrumpIsTheVictor 8 points 3 days ago Trump with another Filibuster post. The GOP isn't going to do it, Trump knows they will not do it, and Trump is ok with that. This is all a show and it is just a bone for the base to keep them interested. Do not fall for this empty shit. The GOP is scum. The only answer is a 3rd party. It is the only way to destroy the GOP. Remember these words: The Left will never be defeated unless the GOP is destroyed first. permalink award report block reply\nImYourHuckleberry24 6 points 3 days ago Sorry, but these endless capitalized posts making demands with no results is beyond tiresome anymore.

Interesting filibuster bill-killing successes:\n1891 - Federal Elections Bill\n1922 - Anti-lynching Bill\n1934 - Anti-lynching Bill\n1942 - Anti Poll-Tax Bill\n1946 - Fair employment Practices Bill\n^^ all Bills killed were attributed to Southern Democrats However,\n1970 Amendment to Abolish the Electoral College (introduced by Bayh - D) was killed via Thurman - D, who believed it would alienate minorities (because he needed their votes?). permalink award report block reply\nmikejones 1 points 3 days ago Trump is full on panic mode. Suggesting 50 year mortgage rates and other stuff not good like $2000 per person. Knowing Trump the business man, I won't be surprised if Trump is what accelerated the globalists plans by setting him up in so many traps he couldn't escape without looking bad. permalink award report block reply\nMaBaker 1 points 3 days ago And how easily could it be turned over later? permalink award report block reply\nfriedchicken 1 points 3 days ago They are psychopaths.

Republicans regularly lose by 5-10% in blue cities without even campaigning at all. we let Democrats beat us this time by running candidates pretending to be conservative, or even ex Republicans. we let people forget the golden Ishtar that was literally standing on top the nyc courthouse, the satanic inverted rainbows everywhere, the Easter speech, pregnant men.    we let the achievements get soft pedaled.  one ny businessman just shut down the illegal migration to a trickle, blew away the Iran threat as a side project, same way as he pulled NKs teeth last time, proved the U.S.A. wouldnt die without free trade. we need to be on the ground locally with the energy of this one old man. permalink award report block reply\nAraket 1 points 3 days ago Let me guess, 8 more people arrested for deportation.

Nuke the filibuster, them put it back in place and make rules changes require 2/3 of the Senate. Pass everything you want before you change the rules. Now there's nothing to complain about, and nothing for Dems to do other than whine. It won't happen, because the weaksauce changes Republicans put in place will show exactly why nothing gets improved when they take over. They just want to go downhill with the brakes on half-heartedly. permalink award report block reply HoganT 2 points 3 days ago It won\u2019t happen because it can\u2019t happen. The rules of the senate are decided by each new senate and no previous senate can constrain a future one. You\u2019d need to change the constitution. You might want to actually learn how things really work before opining on them like you have any idea whatsoever what you\u2019re talking about. permalink parent award report block reply d_lock 0 points 2 days ago Fair on future Senate rule changes -- a subtlety I'd missed. Doesn't change the underlying issue that politicians have spines made out of water, and they would show exactly that if they were given the opportunity to fix long broken policy. I've seen them bend over backwards for decades (probably centuries to be honest, I just haven't been around that long) to leave those problems in place and kill bills to fix things in committee, all while they claim they're \"really trying\" to do something this time. permalink parent award report block reply\nHoganT 2 points 3 days ago It won\u2019t happen because it can\u2019t happen.
