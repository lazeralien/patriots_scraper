Politicians were saying this in 1975 when the national debt was only 500 billion, which equivalent to only 3 Trillion in 2025 dollars. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... snoopy3210 5 points 3 days ago Nah a dividend is just a return on investment. He\u2019s rebuilding American manufacturing. Problem is this is the wrong argument right now with the pending supreme court decision. It\u2019s not about money collection. It\u2019s about regulating BAD TRADE BEHAVIOR, like illegal dumping, by foreign countries during an emergency.

Literal media rhetoric, repeated unironically and \"organically\" upbotted, sorry upvoted. Covid stimmy checks were a drop in the bucket of your inflation woes, yet you still repeat the same mindless drivel. At $2k, given to a third of the population, would total around 435 billion, which is 1.4 percent of the current national debt. Just shut up and stop spreading lies like blatant propagandists. The CRs passed most years add far more to inflation than a simple tariff surplus stimulus ever would.

Like in the decade after unveiling this you would likely see prices triple. Money spent is what causes inflation. And this money would be spent by 2/3 of the people.

Let that sink in.  We are in serious debt and the President chooses to send YOUR tax dollars to Argentina to subsidize their ranchers so that they can undercut OUR ranchers. It's your money.  I hope you like what Trump's doing with it. #ArgentinaFirst permalink parent award report block reply GatoradeJeb 1 points 2 days ago Cool now do israel permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut 7 points 3 days ago This amounts to ~$435 billion, or 1.4% of the debt. The next CR will wipeout all that payment, and double the debt contribution you attempted to alleviate. Better to give it to people who can actually use it, and give a real and meaningful sense of policy impact to your average voter, than some performative placation of people who dont understand how Keynesian economics works. permalink parent award report block reply NebraskanPatriot 0 points 3 days ago Well, Trump announced today that he is DOUBLING the amount of our tax dollars that go to help Argentina's cattle ranchers.  Does that qualify as 'people who can actually use it?' Because, technically, Argentina can actually use your hard-earned tax dollars. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut 3 points 3 days ago Thats a blatant lie, hes not using tax dollars for this, propagandist, hes just allowing more imports by using a targeted tariff structure. Nothing to do with tax funds at all, liar. Those ranchers increasing their own production would have stopped it from happening in the first place, as hes doing it in response to artificially high beef prices. But they chose a different path to protect short term financial considerations, and that has long term consequences. So nah, dont care about your incredibly fallacious opinion. Lie to a retard who will believe it, handshake. permalink parent award report block reply Megaboom2025 2 points 3 days ago Can\u2019t pay it off with tariffs.

You mean living well below the means of our parents and grandparents who had a single income and working 4x as much? Oh, and back then, they were buying American. American labor is expensive, but it also made non-disposable products and allowed Americans to have a prosperous middle class. Sure, a TV or a washer or freezer would cost double or triple or more what a cheap Chinese piece of shit does. But it would last a generation. You rarely had to buy new, unless you wanted to, as things could be easily maintained and repaired. If we made things here, people would be making a lot more money rather than having all the productivity siphoned off by technocrats. But I'm sure you already knew that. permalink parent award report block reply barryb0nds -1 points 3 days ago You mean living well below the means of our parents and grandparents who had a single income and working 4x as much? The boomer generation is an unprecedented anomaly in a long history that likely won't be repeated anytime soon. The US economy post WWII managed to capture lightning in a bottle.

We're not printing money, we're giving tariff money to citizens. They think it's going to create inflation. No it's not. It's going to temporarily give citizens more purchasing power. I'm glad you understand. permalink parent award report block reply bluewhiteandred 4 points 3 days ago I guess I understand now through a couple of these comments why people were incorrectly (afaik?) thinking this would cause inflation: it's because the checks themselves are identical, but their sources are different. Hence without understanding the source being different, they think the tariff checks are inflationary like money printing checks would be. (I think I see people make the same - afaik erroneous - argument with respect to raising people's wages. It doesn't cause inflation if it comes from existing profits of a company.) permalink parent award report block reply FORMERCHILDSTAR 4 points 3 days ago Correct permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 2 points 3 days ago first, US is printing a ton of money still. Second, SCC is still deliberating on whether the tariffs are legal. Very likely they will decide that they are not. In which case every company is going to file for reimbursement. Guess where the money to pay that all back is going to come from. permalink parent award report block reply FORMERCHILDSTAR 2 points 3 days ago That's a lot of speculation about the SCC regarding tariffs. But, yes printing too much money will cause it to be more worthless. This tariff proposal however isn't linked to printing more money, it's simply a proposal to redistribute tariff monies back to the USA citizens. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

Dividends aren't the answer; 50-year debt slavery isn't the answer. DECORRUPTING the longitudinal rot in the American soul is a start on the answer; which involves execution of traitors, deportation of invaders, and harm done to active enemies.

But now, you are renting out a room in your house to a boarder, and you have extra income, yet, you still have to lean on more credit card debt each month to make ends meet.

Good God man! permalink award report block reply barryb0nds 0 points 3 days ago Yay more inflation. Citing stock market prices is weird. The stock market hitting new highs every other week is being carried by the tech sector via AI companies and frankly it's alarming. Take tech companies out and the market barely moved in a year. Just to pick an example, take Schwab's dividend ETF https://totalrealreturns.com/s/USDOLLAR,SCHD?start=2024-11-05 It's holdings are all, long term SOLID American companies that pay good dividends. It's down from 1 year ago. I think another 6, 12, maybe 18 months bull run until the AI bubble bursts. Even before the election we had analysts at Schwab and Vanguard warning we could see a decade of only 3$ annualized S&P500 growth due to tech being so overvalued. Does anybody really think Nvidia is worth 5 TRILLION dollars? I don't think this is sustainable at all. permalink award report block reply questionmarks 0 points 3 days ago polls must be looking grim permalink award report block reply lispboy 0 points 3 days ago It's a whooping 96\u00a2/hr raise for a full time worker. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver 2 points 3 days ago It\u2019s not a raise AT ALL. it\u2019s a Bonus. permalink parent award report block reply DagneyTaggart -1 points 3 days ago This will feed hyperinflation.

Dividends aren't the answer; 50-year debt slavery isn't the answer. DECORRUPTING the longitudinal rot in the American soul is a start on the answer; which involves execution of traitors, deportation of invaders, and harm done to active enemies.

If you have debt - any money spent NOT paying it off is borrowed. permalink parent award report block reply\nnewestofnew 1 points 3 days ago he's actually hurting the currency significantly currently, because with the tariff regime dollars are returning home from abroad. majority of international dollars holdings are eurodollars created by fractional reserve systems at European branches of american banks. Trump has no plan on dealing with international dollars flooding the domestic market. has no attention on it. that's why gold is at 4,000 and just getting started. permalink parent award report block reply LaptopDied 0 points 3 days ago Well some will use that new money well and some won't.

How about we take these\"excess\"funds and start paying down the fucking debt? Who is advising him of this retarded idea? Mr. President, if you are listening, please rethink this! Good God man! permalink award report block reply\nbarryb0nds 0 points 3 days ago Yay more inflation. Citing stock market prices is weird. The stock market hitting new highs every other week is being carried by the tech sector via AI companies and frankly it's alarming. Take tech companies out and the market barely moved in a year. Just to pick an example, take Schwab's dividend ETF https://totalrealreturns.com/s/USDOLLAR,SCHD?start=2024-11-05 It's holdings are all, long term SOLID American companies that pay good dividends. It's down from 1 year ago. I think another 6, 12, maybe 18 months bull run until the AI bubble bursts. Even before the election we had analysts at Schwab and Vanguard warning we could see a decade of only 3$ annualized S&P500 growth due to tech being so overvalued. Does anybody really think Nvidia is worth 5 TRILLION dollars? I don't think this is sustainable at all. permalink award report block reply\nquestionmarks 0 points 3 days ago polls must be looking grim permalink award report block reply\nlispboy 0 points 3 days ago It's a whooping 96\u00a2/hr raise for a full time worker. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver 2 points 3 days ago It\u2019s not a raise AT ALL. it\u2019s a Bonus. permalink parent award report block reply\nYaharaRiver 2 points 3 days ago It\u2019s not a raise AT ALL. it\u2019s a Bonus. permalink parent award report block reply\nDagneyTaggart -1 points 3 days ago This will feed hyperinflation.
