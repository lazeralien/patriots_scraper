Americans can earn a German undergraduate or graduate degree without speaking German and without paying tuition: about 900 undergraduate or graduate degrees are offered exclusively in English, with courses ranging from engineering to social sciences. Norwegian universities do not charge tuition fees for international students and many programs are taught in English. Slovenia has about 150 English programs available and foreign nationals only pay a small fee when they enroll.

I started at the very beginning of trumps first term. It was great under trump. Then, in the first year of bidens presidency, during all the covid bullshit, we were told to join a teams meeting randomly. My entire team stopped what we were doing and went to this mandatory meeting. I thought it might be about the covid shot or even layoffs. Wrong. We joined a meeting where a 20 something girl with a thick accent was in the middle of a lecture. Within a couple seconds it became clear that the lecture was about how we, as American citizens, should be doing MORE for her than paying for her to go to Harvard. As an illegal, it wasn't enough that she had a free ride to Harvard, the other students could tell she didn't come from moneybecause she couldn't attend concerts and fancy dinners with the other student. We should do more for her. I listened for a couple minutes before telling my team to go back to work. I would have inturrupted the meeting to tell her to fuck off, but the chat and mic were locked. I did about the only thing I could and sent some emails up the chain, but I basically got a lot of agreement from the higher up positions, but an apologetic \"there's nothing we can do.\" What garbage. permalink parent award report block reply Rudy_DankMemer 3 points 6 days ago I work for dhs how often do you have to deal with (any alphabet) glowfags from the field? and how do you not lose your shit? permalink parent award report block reply Gadsden 6 points 6 days ago Not often.

UrShulgi 25 points 6 days ago I get where this is supposed to be going, but I disagree with it. People with 50 million pay over half of the income tax, while being a single digit percentage portion of the population.  Also, the 'bail outs' from 'too big to fail' were almost entirely self funded.  TARP (toxic assets relief program) actually MADE MONEY at first, although it ended up netting a 31 billion total cost when it ended.  The fines the 'big banks' paid for the mortgage side of things ended up fully funding HAMP, HARP, and several other programs, where people were able to modify or refinance their mortgages to crazy low rates (2%), short sell existing properties at a loss with the remaining debt being waived, etc... resulting in billions of savings for home owners.  So while the investment banks are the ones that really fucked up with their derivatives and swaps, the government saved our entire economy from blowing up for 31 billion...a pretty good fucking deal.  Homeowners ultimately benefited from the modification/refi programs that the big banks funded in fines they paid (110 billion in fines).  So overall, the system saved itself and benefited home owners. Not saying they were perfect citizens, but this 'blame the rich' shit is fucking commie propaganda.  The rich pay the lions share of taxes, create the jobs we all support ourselves with, and even when they fuck up, they end up paying it all back and then some. permalink award report block reply indigo_truther 5 points 6 days ago I always wondered if it was wise to prop up an obviously broken system.

Somehow I don't think properties doubling and sometimes even tripling since then is evidence of a fair/balanced/corrupt-free system. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 0 points 6 days ago Yeah, but what they pay isn't as destructive to their overall budget and lively hood. They don't have to scrimp and save just to survive. But to be clear, all income, payroll, and property tax are theft. We need to cut the government to the bone. permalink parent award report block reply hatredcopter -4 points 6 days ago What kind of retarded pro-bank fan fiction is this shit? permalink parent award report block reply UrShulgi 6 points 6 days ago My friend, I worked in the belly of the beast while it was all going down.  You're welcome to try and point out any factual inconsistencies you can find, but look it up...TARP cost 31 billion, the mortgage banks paid 110 billion in fines which funded programs like HAMP/HARP.  Or is this just more hate the wealthy commie shit? permalink parent award report block reply IHaveABetterSolution 2 points 6 days ago I was under the impression the money supply was expanded during both the great recession and the more recent 2023 SVB and related bailouts. That isn't the case? M1, M2, whatever. Novel money being created. Genuinely curious, not never been in the belly of the beast and don't ever care to be. permalink parent award report block reply UrShulgi 2 points 6 days ago No.  M1 is liquid money, including physical currency and money held in checking accounts.  M2 includes all of M1 and everything that is semi-liquid, which includes stuff like savings accounts, CDs under 100k, and money market accounts. TARP instead allowed the US Treasury to purchase and/or guarantee bad assets on the books of banks, which was the big problem.  By purchasing or guaranteeing them, the bank could still consider them as solid assets.  The price was an interest rate which the banks paid until the assets were either paid back, or no longer needing guaranteed.  These types of funds don't hit M1 or M2. permalink parent award report block reply hatredcopter -6 points 6 days ago Ah, an appeal to authority to justify the pro-bank fan fiction.\nIts such a noble thing that the banks funded these programs - through fines for wrongdoing. And it cost the US government \"only\" 31 billion. What a great deal. And everyone lived happily ever after. permalink parent award report block reply UrShulgi 4 points 6 days ago If you're going to say stupid shit like someone who worked in the industry telling you about stuff that happened while it was going down is an 'appeal to authority', I can't even argue with you.  You're literally a fucking retard who writes off 1st hand knowledge of what happened.  Also, you're not even using the fallacy correctly: The appeal to authority fallacy is when an argument is based on the idea that a claim is true simply because an authority figure said it, rather than on evidence and facts. I was sharing my personal knowledge and not pointing to some major figure involved in the scandal as the only reason I'm right. I supported what I said about it with easily verifiable facts and numbers about how much the programs cost.  You can literally look up what I said to prove that I'm right. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

The federal government would have exploded the currency if they had funded the bailout. They guaranteed loans that were paid back. They set up the structure of the bailout, allowing a bunch of big banks to absorb the losses. That\u2019s what happened. Sorry if that makes you mad. If they allowed the failure to happen the federal government would have been on the hook for hundreds of billions of FDIC insured accounts. permalink parent award report block reply hatredcopter 2 points 6 days ago Good, that's what happens when you decide to insure shit, you might have to pay it out. Maybe not do that next time. Probably shouldn't have let savings and investment banks merge either if you didn't want to have to cover investment risk with your deposit insurance. It took less than ten years for this shit to play out. And where are we now? Banks are more consolidated and embedded in everything than ever before. Groups that benefited directly from the government's actions own trillions in assets and push commie DEI bullshit through the companies they own. Home ownership, the pretend goal of the actions, is down while these companies buy them up instead. FDIC - FDR. Democrat policy.\nGLBA - Clinton. Democrat policy.\nBank bailouts - Obama.

So fuck them. As for the upper class, they are so wealthy that even though they get taxed a ton, it doesn't affect them much because they can still afford it and live comfortably. This leaves the middle class which is not only expected to front the bill for the lower class like the upper class does but also is not afforded the same benefits and handouts that the poor gets. So we continue to be fucked in all this. You don't have to wonder why generations of the middle class now are pissed and will vote for Trump and other to blow up the system. At this point, I'm willing to vote in the most radical candidate possible.

They were people being paid for the money they put in. Nobody got a bailout because they had fifty million. There is a legal order to who gets paid first when a company goes under.

The buyer of the house has a huge asset (the house) that's still worth a lot of money.  The labor created the profit for the builder and created the thing that has value (the house).

We joined a meeting where a 20 something girl with a thick accent was in the middle of a lecture. Within a couple seconds it became clear that the lecture was about how we, as American citizens, should be doing MORE for her than paying for her to go to Harvard. As an illegal, it wasn't enough that she had a free ride to Harvard, the other students could tell she didn't come from moneybecause she couldn't attend concerts and fancy dinners with the other student. We should do more for her. I listened for a couple minutes before telling my team to go back to work. I would have inturrupted the meeting to tell her to fuck off, but the chat and mic were locked. I did about the only thing I could and sent some emails up the chain, but I basically got a lot of agreement from the higher up positions, but an apologetic \"there's nothing we can do.\" What garbage. permalink parent award report block reply Rudy_DankMemer 3 points 6 days ago I work for dhs how often do you have to deal with (any alphabet) glowfags from the field? and how do you not lose your shit? permalink parent award report block reply Gadsden 6 points 6 days ago Not often.

People with 50 million pay over half of the income tax, while being a single digit percentage portion of the population.  Also, the 'bail outs' from 'too big to fail' were almost entirely self funded.  TARP (toxic assets relief program) actually MADE MONEY at first, although it ended up netting a 31 billion total cost when it ended.  The fines the 'big banks' paid for the mortgage side of things ended up fully funding HAMP, HARP, and several other programs, where people were able to modify or refinance their mortgages to crazy low rates (2%), short sell existing properties at a loss with the remaining debt being waived, etc... resulting in billions of savings for home owners.  So while the investment banks are the ones that really fucked up with their derivatives and swaps, the government saved our entire economy from blowing up for 31 billion...a pretty good fucking deal.  Homeowners ultimately benefited from the modification/refi programs that the big banks funded in fines they paid (110 billion in fines).  So overall, the system saved itself and benefited home owners. Not saying they were perfect citizens, but this 'blame the rich' shit is fucking commie propaganda.  The rich pay the lions share of taxes, create the jobs we all support ourselves with, and even when they fuck up, they end up paying it all back and then some. permalink award report block reply indigo_truther 5 points 6 days ago I always wondered if it was wise to prop up an obviously broken system.

You're welcome to try and point out any factual inconsistencies you can find, but look it up...TARP cost 31 billion, the mortgage banks paid 110 billion in fines which funded programs like HAMP/HARP.  Or is this just more hate the wealthy commie shit? permalink parent award report block reply IHaveABetterSolution 2 points 6 days ago I was under the impression the money supply was expanded during both the great recession and the more recent 2023 SVB and related bailouts. That isn't the case? M1, M2, whatever. Novel money being created. Genuinely curious, not never been in the belly of the beast and don't ever care to be. permalink parent award report block reply UrShulgi 2 points 6 days ago No.  M1 is liquid money, including physical currency and money held in checking accounts.  M2 includes all of M1 and everything that is semi-liquid, which includes stuff like savings accounts, CDs under 100k, and money market accounts. TARP instead allowed the US Treasury to purchase and/or guarantee bad assets on the books of banks, which was the big problem.  By purchasing or guaranteeing them, the bank could still consider them as solid assets.  The price was an interest rate which the banks paid until the assets were either paid back, or no longer needing guaranteed.  These types of funds don't hit M1 or M2. permalink parent award report block reply hatredcopter -6 points 6 days ago Ah, an appeal to authority to justify the pro-bank fan fiction.\nIts such a noble thing that the banks funded these programs - through fines for wrongdoing. And it cost the US government \"only\" 31 billion. What a great deal. And everyone lived happily ever after. permalink parent award report block reply UrShulgi 4 points 6 days ago If you're going to say stupid shit like someone who worked in the industry telling you about stuff that happened while it was going down is an 'appeal to authority', I can't even argue with you.  You're literally a fucking retard who writes off 1st hand knowledge of what happened.  Also, you're not even using the fallacy correctly: The appeal to authority fallacy is when an argument is based on the idea that a claim is true simply because an authority figure said it, rather than on evidence and facts. I was sharing my personal knowledge and not pointing to some major figure involved in the scandal as the only reason I'm right. I supported what I said about it with easily verifiable facts and numbers about how much the programs cost.  You can literally look up what I said to prove that I'm right. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

The federal government would have exploded the currency if they had funded the bailout. They guaranteed loans that were paid back. They set up the structure of the bailout, allowing a bunch of big banks to absorb the losses. That\u2019s what happened. Sorry if that makes you mad. If they allowed the failure to happen the federal government would have been on the hook for hundreds of billions of FDIC insured accounts. permalink parent award report block reply hatredcopter 2 points 6 days ago Good, that's what happens when you decide to insure shit, you might have to pay it out. Maybe not do that next time. Probably shouldn't have let savings and investment banks merge either if you didn't want to have to cover investment risk with your deposit insurance. It took less than ten years for this shit to play out. And where are we now? Banks are more consolidated and embedded in everything than ever before. Groups that benefited directly from the government's actions own trillions in assets and push commie DEI bullshit through the companies they own.

TARP instead allowed the US Treasury to purchase and/or guarantee bad assets on the books of banks, which was the big problem.  By purchasing or guaranteeing them, the bank could still consider them as solid assets.  The price was an interest rate which the banks paid until the assets were either paid back, or no longer needing guaranteed.

So fuck them. As for the upper class, they are so wealthy that even though they get taxed a ton, it doesn't affect them much because they can still afford it and live comfortably. This leaves the middle class which is not only expected to front the bill for the lower class like the upper class does but also is not afforded the same benefits and handouts that the poor gets. So we continue to be fucked in all this. You don't have to wonder why generations of the middle class now are pissed and will vote for Trump and other to blow up the system. At this point, I'm willing to vote in the most radical candidate possible.

The $0 and welfare makes you dependent on the party promising and giving you those things. $2300 gives you independent though and enough knowledge to know the American Dream was alive when we were nationalists with a common history and ethnic/religious bond. permalink award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\nnewdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\nspinometer2 1 points 6 days ago not quite true but directionally correct permalink award report block reply\nMarkosis17 1 points 6 days ago What is savings? permalink award report block reply\nDrinkTeaNotKoolaid 1 points 6 days ago Fxcking A bubba! ,,,,,,,bubbet,,,,,, permalink award report block reply\nMhmm2MoreWeeks 1 points 6 days ago This is why the Education system is so in urgent need of being remade. Wealth is not generated from labor. A job merely lets you tread water. Residual income on services is how you get rich. That or you get real good at financial markets/crypto/stock.

If the labor is spent in the production of things, the thing exists afterwards and has value, and the worker was paid for their labor. A builder hires construction workers to build a house.  The workers provide for their families with the money they get.  The builder makes a profit on building the house.  The buyer of the house has a huge asset (the house) that's still worth a lot of money.  The labor created the profit for the builder and created the thing that has value (the house).  Labor created wealth. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply user2827 1 points 6 days ago Won't make sense to the young guys, but there was a saying, \"you don't get rich signing the back of the check.\" The plan of finding ways to build residual income or investing (although crypto is closer to a ponzi scheme than many want to admit) is almost critical, but wages have been so far outshined by inflation, that the options for people are getting slimmer.

The 'kids' around town didnt bother to apply. At the local walmart I asked a manager why they have so many registers but only a few open? She told me that the high school kids do not want to work on the weekend. So, They end up getting fired. They cannot find good people to work. I walked down an isle and this worker scared the shi* out of me. She was a koolaid head and tatoos everywhere with metal in her head. I got out of there quick. On leaving I saw a guy in a dress at a cash register. Your right \"Lazy Damn kids\" is actually an understatement. Weird people fits better. The other day I saw a billboard advertising 26/hr with sign up bonus for one of the local factories. This is because ICE has come to town I suspect. Of course, Any factory job beats the heck out of working at walmart or a gas station. permalink parent award report block reply newdaynewname9 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\nUncleTrumpsBand 1 points 6 days ago Um, this is a large majority of those under 30.
