All blue cities have been sold a huge lie by the democrat party.  That lie is that diversity by other cultures will mix together and work towards a common goal.  This is wrong.  Its a lie.  The democrat sponsored invasion of the US causes chaos, violence, crime, and terror in the people while democrat politicians get fabulously rich (the real goal).  So far, most of the South (outside the obvious democrat cities like Memphis and Atlanta) have been saved from this invasion. permalink award report block reply Nomolies 4 points 5 days ago Christianity. It really is that simple.  Even people who are not Christian are influenced in some positive ways by the higher percentage of Christians & churches in the south. It's not perfect - there are some very imperfect denominations, churches, and pastors out there (of course, none of us - with the exception of Christ - is perfect). The historical basis for Southerners' neighborliness towards even people they do not know stems in particular from growing up hearing this passage of Scripture in the New Testament (the money quotes are in vv. 29, 36, & 37): Luke 10:25 \u00a0\u00a0And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, \u201cTeacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d 26 He said to him, \u201cWhat is written in the Law? How do you read it?\u201d 27 And he answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\u201d 28 And he said to him, \u201cYou have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.\u201d Luke 10:29 \u00a0\u00a0But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, \u201cAnd who is my neighbor?\u201d Luke 10:30 Jesus replied, \u201cA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. 31 Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. 32 So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. 34 He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, \u2018Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.\u2019 Luke 10:36 Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\u201d Luke 10:37 He said, \u201cThe one who showed him mercy.\u201d And Jesus said to him, \u201cYou go, and do likewise.\u201d In the early church, the traditional interpretation of this passage was that Jesus is the Good Samaritan (whom we should emulate), the church is the inn, the oil and wine represent the sacraments of baptism (the water of baptism was followed by the application of chrism in the early church) and the Eucharist, and the Samaritan's return is Judgment Day. Post-Christian cultures devolve into tribalism - e.g., people are less likely to help a young woman being stabbed on a metro if that person is outside of their subgroup within the larger society. In contrast, I have known Christians in the south from many backgrounds - whether white, black, yellow or brown - who have shown great kindness to people outside of their group because they love and follow the One who is truly the \"Good Samaritan.\" Church attendance, of course, declines in southern cities when they grow beyond a certain point and the local culture is replaced by people from many regions (leaving no shared sense of right and wrong, virtues to inculcate, and vices to avoid). The ultimate solution to this is not political (although the world is a better place when we vote for virtuous policies and oppose bad policies).  That is because politics is downstream from the culture, and the culture is downstream from religion. permalink award report block reply Xahnel 3 points 5 days ago It's called \"heat\" It's too fucking hot to spend the energy on being a rude cunt.
