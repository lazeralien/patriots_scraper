Updoot! permalink parent award report block reply goatnuts 47 points 5 days ago A lot of people don't understand, Britain's population was higher before world war 2 than until 2017, that population includes the Pakis and Bangladeshis and Jamaicans and everybody else. Just actual ethnic British people, their population to this day has never recovered. That's how badly the Germans bombed them. So imagine being this man. Youre a child and britain is beautiful. Youre a young man and half of it is destroyed, the place looks like iraq. You fight, you win, you think it's time for things to get better. And they do. But the things your country does to rebuild completely destroys it, turns it into something alien to you. He might not even have an issue with immigrants, but it's still unrecognizable to him. It's a police state where his people are second class citizens among foreigners. Anyone too stupid to get this has no business interviewing anyone. permalink parent award report block reply PROCIsAsshoe 32 points 5 days ago Beautifully put. It's really a powerful thing to contemplate. I deeply admire this man for being brave enough to take this chance to speak out. To hear a 100 year old man that fought in the war sit there and say \"we fought for nothing, we are less free today\". wow! Talk about pathos! If that doesn't shock you awake whatever could? permalink parent award report block reply Tongs_Ya_Bass 22 points 5 days ago UK population 1939 was 47 million, in 2017 66.6 million and now nearly 70 million. Around 85% are Brits from the census. That makes about 59 million, 12 million more than 1939. During WW2 there were only 70k civilian deaths and about 350k military deaths. Germany did not bomb the UK so bad that the population never recovered. Tonnes of kids were evacuated to the country or abroad to places like Belfast or NYC. An estimated 2 million left for the Commonwealth countries, South Africa, USA etc post WW2. Your claims and the numbers don't align. permalink parent award report block reply MakeArdernGoAway 9 points 5 days ago Yeh his numbers are total horseshit. The population increased significantly between 1939 and 1948. permalink parent award report block reply TPMJB 7 points 5 days ago Around 85% are Brits from the census. Lol how many of those \"Brits\" have parents that are both brown? permalink parent award report block reply Tongs_Ya_Bass 0 points 5 days ago None, there's a separate category for mixed race or other races the category I referenced is White British. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

The grooming and rape of white girls from 12 to 14 without any consequences is a terrible thing.  It ends when we can't protect little girls from invaders.

Hitler held back and let Britain evacuate as another attempt at peace. permalink parent award report block reply StayoutOfit 15 points 5 days ago Most have a very one sided and propagandized view of history.  Many are unfamiliar with Hitler's attempts to strike piece with the Brits and how the Brits continually rejected those efforts from the top down. permalink parent award report block reply Tongs_Ya_Bass 6 points 5 days ago Churchill withheld the peace offers from the public.

And had to recover from all the drug use.  The Luftwaffe bombed the crap out of the beaches.  They weren't holding back.  The Brits lost 68000 soldiers..  6 destroyers were sunk, 23 damaged.  89 transport ships lost.  177 aircraft destroyed.  Goering lost some prestige in not doing better. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 3 points 5 days ago I don\u2019t fully buy that logic. Britain suing for peace would have been viewed as a massive betrayal by the French and Polish. On top of that, the Brits correctly concluded that Germany lacked the ability to invade Great Britain, so from their point of view, Hitler couldn\u2019t win. permalink parent award report block reply Wanderlust 1 points 5 days ago Germany sued for peace. They even air dropped royalty to UK. UK imprisoned him and he was never able to contact his cousin. UK wanted blood. Churchill was pretty public about it. permalink parent award report block reply AmericanJawa 2 points 5 days ago Hitler held back and let Britain evacuate as another attempt at peace. A lie will forever be a lie no matter how many times you tell it. permalink parent award report block reply PROCIsAsshoe 2 points 5 days ago not true, whatsoever. their response was confusing and slow but it wasn't some sort of olive branch. if he wanted peace he would have trapped their army on the beaches and forced a surrender, not allow the entire British army to retreat and live to fight another day. The successful withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of British infantrymen from Dunkirk is literally the only reason that Britain managed to stay in the fight! permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 1 points 5 days ago You literally just helped another poster lie about British population numbers.

The NatSocs were not perfect saints, they were just people who fought against the same international forces we struggle against today.  Accepting this allowed me to accept their flaws and good traits all in context and see their good deeds for what they were. WW2 was a struggle to continue western civilization as it was, and that war was lost.  Have hope though, as long as our blood remains our people can rebuild and expand upon what our ancestors first achieved.  It isn't over until each one of us is dead. permalink parent award report block reply Mecoperator2525 10 points 5 days ago Americans are already being replaced by immigrants that can easily be exploited.

Which is why it has been quasi banned. Physical editions are going for hundreds, if not thousands and digital editions are prone to being altered. Because of French copyright laws (life of author + 70 years) the book won't enter public domain until 2090. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 11 points 5 days ago I\u2019m bringing it up because I\u2019m well aware of how the book was effectively banned for years since they wouldn\u2019t print it. However, in a fairly recent development, someone secured the rights to it and is printing it again in English. It\u2019s available on Amazon for about $25. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 2 points 5 days ago They didn't willingly decolonize, socialist faggot politicians and American Jews forced them to against the wishes of British citizens and even most colonial subjects And now all those former colonies are shitholes, which is why the majority of the colonial subjects wanted the Empire to remain permalink parent award report block reply TheAttackTitan 1 points 5 days ago What is  it about? permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 5 points 5 days ago Mass immigration from third world/shithole countries to Europe.

Mostly fresh faced young men.  I wonder what they really suffered for. When the ruling class is shielded from the physical battlefield, bad things happen. permalink parent award report block reply Cyer6 12 points 5 days ago The WWI WWII, Korean, Vietnam and Gulf War vets...

Today, our kids celebrated veterans and Veteran's Day at their school inviting all veteran family members. This was in Texas and that American pride was all over that school. But again I still don't know what was really accomplished.  A lot of good boys are gone and now being replaced with 3rd world dregs who are adored by white liberal women. permalink parent award report block reply Rebooted 7 points 5 days ago Yes, but now they have a central bank linked to the international system.  So, the goal was achieved. permalink parent award report block reply Pappy_Gunn 4 points 5 days ago Afghanistan was terrible.  Most NATO moochers went for non-combat roles (with exceptions being the US, UK, Canada and a few other) and \"reconstruction\" which was a big, fat through for NGOs and money laundering.  NATO helped write the constitution for the Afghan Republic (before the Taliban took over again).  Article 1 stated that Afghanistan is an Islamic Republic, article 2 was that Sharia was the law.  We fought and died to establish an Islamic Republic.  The last church in Afghanistan was burned under NATO's nose, Christians killed and taken as slaves. permalink parent award report block reply Breacherbear 2 points 5 days ago We had a male LT that was running on base at night in Kandahar. Some of our NATO \"allies\" grabbed and rapped him. We were ordered not to walk alone at night after that. permalink parent award report block reply Pappy_Gunn 3 points 5 days ago The media avoided at all cost to mention the institutional pedophilia (and some bestiality) that is part of the Afghan culture.

Clement immediately made the call for subjects in British colonies in the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East to come into England in order to rebuild and repopulate the country, specifically London. From this move on, a never ending supply of third worlders continued to flood in and are now taking over the country. permalink award report block reply PROCIsAsshoe 12 points 5 days ago The fact that Churchill lost his role as PM in July, just a few months after the War ends, is so unbelievable fucking rotten. It'd be like kicking George Washington out of office in Christmas 1781, \"hey thanks for winning a literal life-and-death struggle for our Nation, now get out of here!\" Fucking communists inside the UK. Kicked him out of office and also delivered our atomic secrets to the Soviets all within two years of the war ending. With allies like that, who needs enemies? permalink parent award report block reply Pappy_Gunn 5 points 5 days ago The Brits gave the Soviets modern jet engines to \"equalize\" the cold war.  The Soviets reverse-engineered it (I thinkk it was the Nene), did a few improvements and it propelled the MiG 15 which was the scourge of the air war in Korea, downing many B-29s and asorted allied aircraft. permalink parent award report block reply covok48 2 points 5 days ago Bong politics are another level of fuckery that Americans cannot comprehend.

I had a chat with a nanny (she's in her late 50's) at our school pickup today about the fireworks show she went to for bonfire night and learned that patriotism isn't a thing for some people in England. She basically said that she feels that any patriotic behavior is actually far right behavior and should be avoided at all costs lest you are labeled to be a fascist (flying flags, being proud of your country achievements, playing the national anthem, etc...). Very sad. permalink award report block reply Dangerous 1 points 5 days ago WWII was explicitly a global war against the very concept of Nationalism in favor of internationalist globalism. The Japanese, Germans, and Italians were nationalist/nationalist socialist and the USA, UK, French, and Soviets were openly Communist/Globalist. The UN was created in the aftermath explicitly as a Globalist function. of course this would lead to decreased patriotism and such ideas being labeled \"far right wing\" that was the entire point of the war permalink parent award report block reply McLemore800 2 points 5 days ago Absolutely hilarious.

He wanted to replace Christianity with Islam when the war was over.  I\u2019m not sure if he would\u2019ve been importing more people from the Middle East or just killing them, but the difference is probably that England would still be covered with goat fuckers and celebrating 5 AM call to prayer, but everyone would also be wearing swastika.

Assuming 40 million population at the time, that's 0.6% of the population or if you assume 1:1 male to female ratio, 1.2% of men. Tragic and I agree, these were probably the best men out there. But statistically, it's not the most significant amount/percentage. permalink parent award report block reply Flying_Pede_121 3 points 5 days ago It\u2019s an enormous loss.

I suggested peace or non-engagement as other (better) outcomes. My comment was not an address to the veteran's on-air comment of reflection. I took user Konsaki's comment as being of two parts: (1) A summary of what the veteran said: \"The vet was saying... for naught.\" And this was followed by (2) user Konsaki's own opinion on what the veteran said: \"Might as well... German win.\" permalink parent award report block reply view 9 more comments... KernalMustard 0 points 5 days ago Well it got them WW2 in the first place.

Just actual ethnic British people, their population to this day has never recovered. That's how badly the Germans bombed them. So imagine being this man. Youre a child and britain is beautiful. Youre a young man and half of it is destroyed, the place looks like iraq. You fight, you win, you think it's time for things to get better. And they do. But the things your country does to rebuild completely destroys it, turns it into something alien to you. He might not even have an issue with immigrants, but it's still unrecognizable to him.

Germany did not bomb the UK so bad that the population never recovered. Tonnes of kids were evacuated to the country or abroad to places like Belfast or NYC.
