It\u2019s disingenuous coming from democrats, but affordability is a high priority issue for Americans. We\u2019ve been through the wringer with Biden. The employment market is also bad right now so Americans aren\u2019t feeling the savings yet. permalink award report block reply LiterallyKaiser 128 points 6 days ago Beef is $8-10 a pound Milk is $2.50-4 a gallon. Cereal is $5 a box, I don\u2019t even buy that anymore. I skip breakfast instead. Spaghetti is $1.25-2 a box. A can of beans is $1-1.40. A can of corn is $1-1.25. Bread is $2.25-5 a loaf. I don\u2019t even bother looking at how much apples or fruit cost. I try going for canned fruit when I can but it\u2019s still damn near $1.50-2 for a can of oranges. You can forget \u201csnacks\u201d. $5 for a bag of chips, and it\u2019s half as much as it was in 2020. Only thing that\u2019s still moderately cheap is frozen veggies. Which I eat a lot of now as a result. Gas is $3 a gallon. These prices ARE NOT CHEAP. They\u2019re all up 20-40% from what they were in 2020. I remember the days when you could get a huge box of Aldi spaghetti for 99 cents. A load of bread at Aldi was 85 cents for the cheapest crap. Now you go in, not only are the options more limited, but they\u2019re also smaller and cost way more. $1.25 for spaghetti and $1.50 for bread. Meanwhile I\u2019ve gotten maybe a cumulative 10% raise over that span of time. I\u2019m tired of hearing about subsidies for AI. I\u2019m tired of corporate tax cuts. I\u2019m tired of billions going to Argentina and Israel and nothing being done for me. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 53 points 6 days ago Spindle-spin -14 points 6 days ago We need to cut taxes and lower the corporate tax rate. There's no way companies can achieve profits and lower prices if they're being taxed. The only way companies lower prices is if they feel gains. President Trump has given us one of the best, strongest economies in decades, but Democrats clogged up the pipeline so that we're not directly feeling it because everyone is paying taxes. permalink parent award report block reply Freeth3usa 26 points 6 days ago You\u2019re completely wrong because people in general give zero shits about corporate profits when less then 20% of the country feel any gain from the stock market , and less then 1% of the country gets a a significant raise, cash, or stock bonus from them. Republicans and unfortunately it includes maga have become beholding to corporate riches that 85%+ of the country would rather see replaced with small business. Buisnesss where individuals/owners who make decisions for that small business are held accountable for good or bad. Instead of CEO\u2019s who indirectly kill, harm, destroy workers, consumers, etc and get off being richer with zero recourse most of the time. permalink parent award report block reply AerialRush 5 points 6 days ago Muh GDP doesn't matter.

People don't understand how bad things were under Biden, nor do they understand how corporate taxes affect them. It also takes some pain to right the ship because this shit was in a nose dive, by design when Biden was done. People are still feeling the pinch and are tired of it, I get that but we literally may have been bankrupt by now of kamala had won.

All prices are higher, especially food and housing.  And that PPP was a giant scam, free money for scammers. We still have inflation out here.  Housing tripled in price. Food doubled.  Half of our city would starve if there weren\u2019t discount grocery stores.  It\u2019s sad and humbling when you hear that peoples goal is to make enough money to be able to walk into grocery store and be able to afford more than just generics. permalink parent award report block reply Simple_Doot 19 points 6 days ago Printing money causes inflation.  Trump prints and spends like the worst of them.  DOGE cuts are a joke compared to the increased spending.  Nothing has changed with spending in decades and if you point it out youre attacked. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 2 points 6 days ago view 1 more comments... CommonSenseAmerican -1 points 6 days ago Gross generalization, no cuts are a joke, Trump got tax on tips removed as well as tax on social security retirement. Trump is doing what must be done as far as spending goes to refinish rebuilding a broken military system and many other things too long to post. It's global inflation also not just the USA. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... HoganP 19 points 6 days ago I've made this point before and I'll reiterate yours, again.  They completely fucked us with the inflation because it's the economic equivalent of getting pee out of a swimming pool.  It's not something that just turns on and off with policy.  The effects, that is. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 2 points 6 days ago hold on one of the reasons Massie is on Trump's shit list is that he held up all the Covid money for spending reasons and lack of individual payments Trump is part of this inflation permalink parent award report block reply Returningtogod 1 points 6 days ago They stole an election, looted the treasury, then pardoned themselves on the way out. permalink parent award report block reply Hanging_Chad 32 points 6 days ago less food stamps \u279c lower food prices \ud83d\udcc9 permalink parent award report block reply BidensBodyDouble 3 points 6 days ago Cut food stamps for the millions abusing it.

For my part I make a very decent income by historical standards, and while I'm not drowning or anything, I'm still well outside of my comfort zone. Forget about saving money, I'm just happy to be keeping my house atm. So this remains a top issue for me and most people I know. I don't think it's Trump's fault that prices have been stubbornly high. But I do think it's premature of him to be claiming victory, and a move that could cost him some of his support. It's categorically untrue to say that things are suddenly affordable to most people. I suspect he's realized how fucked it all is. Prices aren't going to deflate - they will, at best, inflate more slowly - and our best hope is probably to look for wage increases. Not that I've seen one of those keep pace with inflation over the past several years, either. In terms of raw buying power I'm down something like 30-40% since 2020, still today. Losing faith I'll ever get back to where I was, relatively speaking. Again, not super uncomfortable though, and thankful for that. permalink parent award report block reply MastaJoda 6 points 6 days ago ''Let them eat cake.''

This is like the Potato regime's july 4th hot dogs are 16 cents cheaper while your life is falling apart messaging. Most of us understand that recovery and course correction takes a long time. You can't tell struggling people that they're not struggling, though. \"No, no, prices are way down\". They're just going to reject you as someone out of touch that only cares about what's best for DC. The messaging needs to be that the course corrections have been made and help is on the way. And the all Israel, all the time neocon bullshit has to go and never be mentioned again. permalink award report block reply HockeyMom4Trump 38 points 6 days ago Prices are down, but the ballroom is up\u2026not great messaging when people KNOW prices still suck and they will never ever set foot in the ballroom cause they are too busy working to feed their families and have to compete for food with SNAP benefits and illegals. permalink parent award report block reply MastaJoda 25 points 6 days ago \u261d Trumps messaging is basically ''Let them eat cake.'' permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump -4 points 6 days ago Lmfao.

But I don't get why Trump pushed for it in the first place. People are hurting domestically; they need him to cut spending, not spend even more. I get that it's a drop in the ocean and meaningful cuts are mostly out of his control. But it's such bad messaging. permalink parent award report block reply NeoDragoon 8 points 6 days ago It was privately funded, no tax money went into the ballroom, the disinformation is why it's a big deal. permalink parent award report block reply maverick202 4 points 6 days ago Nobody is going to fund it privately unless they get something out of it.

Affordability is a real issue whether or not prices of certain items have gone down.

That also has nothing to do with tariffs. permalink parent award report block reply yuge_covfefe 1 points 6 days ago Money's being paid to the federal government so you're half right. But that same money increases the prices for the consumers, because somebody's got to pay it. Until the feds lower tax rates or issue tax credits (fat chance on either) to reimburse us for those raised costs, the prices at the end of the day are absolutely higher to the people paying them - us. If and when domestic production ramps up, those price increases ought to disappear, or else wages will rise to compensate. So it's a long game, and one that I personally support. But let's be honest about what's really going on. permalink parent award report block reply drmrboy 0 points 6 days ago \ud83e\udd2b permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut 3 points 6 days ago Why are you gay? permalink parent award report block reply NewGovModOnDutyBans 0 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply drmrboy 47 points 6 days ago So fucking what.

Gaslighting people to think Trump's economy isn't doing good is what redditards do and not very productive. Edit: Oh Noes!!! The anti-Trump fags are out in force!!!  Whatever shall I do with all those downdoots?!?!?!  Oh, I know.  I'll tell you to go fuck yourselves.  Trump is your president and Kumala sucks dick to get \"a head\", haha faggots. permalink parent award report block reply armyofpedes4usa 12 points 6 days ago 9-3% just means the rate of which the dollar is being devalued is going down.  You would need a negative inflation rate to really up it's value. permalink parent award report block reply mailinvoter -8 points 6 days ago Wow, just wow. \ud83e\udd26 permalink parent award report block reply NewGovModOnDutyBans 4 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply CovfefeVideo 18 points 6 days ago We'll lose that savings if we turn on the lights. permalink award report block reply ceva 18 points 6 days ago They're also 25% smaller and almost 100% less actual food. The 2025 meal has no fresh veggies (except potatoes) and is full of ultra processed crap. The 2024 meal is significantly larger and has plenty of fresh veggies included. Also, the 2025 meal has turkey listed at \"$0.97/lb. \u2014 lowest price since 2019,\" but the 2024 meal has turkey listed at $0.88/lb.? Make it make sense EDIT: I love that shills are downvoting me for sharing actual facts lol permalink award report block reply armyofpedes4usa 11 points 6 days ago Thanks for the links, so it's more gaslighting. permalink parent award report block reply ceva 9 points 6 days ago No problem! Always follow the procedure of verifying what the powers that be tell you. There's often another story that's going untold. On the surface: lower prices! Great! Looking deeper: the portions are smaller, the food is worse, the prices are actually higher in some respects (per lb price of turkey) permalink parent award report block reply mil5781 2 points 6 days ago What plenty of fresh veggies?  2024 had celery and onions.  2025 has carrots and cranberries.  There's no other veggies there beyond canned, in both years.  There's also plenty of Great Value in both. permalink parent award report block reply ceva 3 points 6 days ago It's still very misleading that 2025 is at all better. The turkey is more expensive (despite the list saying it's cheaper, so it's a lie), the ingredients are fewer, there's overall less available. It's a bad bad bad comparison. permalink parent award report block reply mil5781 0 points 6 days ago I disagree.  It's 13.5 lb Turkey this year, while it was 10 - 16 lb last year.  Since it's a set price, those who got 10 lb Turkeys didn't get it at the 88 cent price point.  It's an $8.88 - $14.08 Turkey last year, and it's a consistent $13 per Turkey this year.  There's no corn meal for muffins, and there's no pecan pie, only pumpkin.  Otherwise, it's basically exactly the same, just swapping out 1 veg for a different one.  22 items in this year compared to 29 last year, but if you take out those extras, it's nearly identical, just some things swapped out for others. It even has close to 3 lbs of fresh vegs this year.  Last year was a celery stalk and onions.  There were no real fresh veg at all.  It also was around 55 for 8 people, and now it's less than 40 for 10 people.  You can spend that extra 15 bucks to get well more than what was left out. Only shill here is you bud. permalink parent award report block reply empiretc 15 points 6 days ago Well, we are going to spend ~$150 this year for 8 people. that is a little less than last year, but not 25%. permalink award report block reply friarfox 14 points 6 days ago He forgot to mention that it's 15 items instead of 21 and uses more generic Best Value products.

It's going to take around 80 years, at this pace, if no more get in and none reproduce. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump -1 points 6 days ago First you complain about the illegals here, then you complain Trump isn\u2019t doing enough, fast enough for you. You realize he\u2019s getting obstructed from all angles right? Try giving POTUS some credit where it\u2019s due. You wouldn\u2019t like what would be happening if Kamala \u201cwon\u201d permalink parent award report block reply BurtMcGirt 1 points 6 days ago I did give President Trump credit for shutting down the flow of illegals. The amount being deported, though, is statistically insignificant. We have a very limited amount of time (probably until mid terms) to get things done. President Trump has probably done all he can do while being obstructed by BOTH wings of the Uniparty. It's a shame there aren't more America First people in Congress to try to advance President Trump's agenda. He cannot do it all on his own. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 12 points 6 days ago Impossible. 25% cheaper?! In what world?? No, the affordability issue is not dead, what the fuck? Horrible messaging. He should be embracing the affordability issue. permalink award report block reply josiborg 12 points 6 days ago He better start going hard because we only have a short time left. No more saving Israel jet setting around the globe. Kick all these people out, save our elections, put laws back in place for propaganda through media and make it tighter (name it Kirk Law), divert the money going to that to American taxpayers, and Lock HER UP!

When they do it this way, they can screw people with solar panels on the buyback rate. permalink parent award report block reply CovfefeKaren 5 points 6 days ago I don't care if this is accurate or not.  All I care about is the fact that when I go to my local grocery store, which is often cheaper than Walmart, ground beef is $7/lb for the cheap stuff.  That's RIDICULOUS!  I haven't cooked a ribeye in months.  I'm not paying $20/lb for Select.  USDA Prime used to be that price!  And eggs still haven't gone down.  Thank God I have chickens.  But feed is the highest it's ever been.  My feed cost per dozen for 2025 is $1.90.  That's just feed, not my time.  Makes it hard to continue providing my family, friends, and coworkers with eggs for $3/doz.  I'm going to have to go to 4, maybe even 5 if this keeps up.  So I really don't want to hear my favorite President tell me how things are less.  I know they're not.  I shop for the family.  I know what shit costs.

I don't even think Trump did it knowing it was wrong, I think he gets this stupid shit brought to him by advisors and just repeats it. The guy isn't grocery shopping and has no clue. If someone actually gets good info to him he always acts to fix it. He just needs someone giving him the truth. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 0 points 6 days ago how can Trump do better if no one complains about anything? permalink parent award report block reply DeathBattleFan123 1 points 6 days ago Halting Biden era runaway inflation is a big win by itself. Reducing the price of key staples like food and gas by 25% from what they were last year is a massive accomplishment. Complaining that it's not lower than it was 5 years ago in a total of 10 months on the job is unreasonable. We are finally headed in the right direction, and rather than celebrating, people like you are dooming. permalink parent award report block reply NewGovModOnDutyBans 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply AntiCommieAktion 0 points 6 days ago Paid 16 dollars for about 5-6 items from the grocery store the other day.

For my part I make a very decent income by historical standards, and while I'm not drowning or anything, I'm still well outside of my comfort zone. Forget about saving money, I'm just happy to be keeping my house atm. So this remains a top issue for me and most people I know. I don't think it's Trump's fault that prices have been stubbornly high. But I do think it's premature of him to be claiming victory, and a move that could cost him some of his support. It's categorically untrue to say that things are suddenly affordable to most people. I suspect he's realized how fucked it all is. Prices aren't going to deflate - they will, at best, inflate more slowly - and our best hope is probably to look for wage increases. Not that I've seen one of those keep pace with inflation over the past several years, either. In terms of raw buying power I'm down something like 30-40% since 2020, still today. Losing faith I'll ever get back to where I was, relatively speaking. Again, not super uncomfortable though, and thankful for that. permalink parent award report block reply MastaJoda 6 points 6 days ago ''Let them eat cake.''

For my part I make a very decent income by historical standards, and while I'm not drowning or anything, I'm still well outside of my comfort zone. Forget about saving money, I'm just happy to be keeping my house atm. So this remains a top issue for me and most people I know. I don't think it's Trump's fault that prices have been stubbornly high. But I do think it's premature of him to be claiming victory, and a move that could cost him some of his support. It's categorically untrue to say that things are suddenly affordable to most people. I suspect he's realized how fucked it all is. Prices aren't going to deflate - they will, at best, inflate more slowly - and our best hope is probably to look for wage increases. Not that I've seen one of those keep pace with inflation over the past several years, either. In terms of raw buying power I'm down something like 30-40% since 2020, still today. Losing faith I'll ever get back to where I was, relatively speaking. Again, not super uncomfortable though, and thankful for that. permalink parent award report block reply\nyuge_covfefe 2 points 6 days ago I guess this issue is polarizing which I hope is good news (at least some people feel it's improving?).

I haven't cooked a ribeye in months.  I'm not paying $20/lb for Select.  USDA Prime used to be that price!  And eggs still haven't gone down.  Thank God I have chickens.  But feed is the highest it's ever been.  My feed cost per dozen for 2025 is $1.90.  That's just feed, not my time.  Makes it hard to continue providing my family, friends, and coworkers with eggs for $3/doz.  I'm going to have to go to 4, maybe even 5 if this keeps up.

That was awesome. permalink award report block reply\nDicksareforChicks 2 points 6 days ago Even cheaper for looters and SNAP recipients \ud83d\ude11 permalink award report block reply\nRocksCanOnlyWait 2 points 6 days ago No it's not. STOP LYING!!! This was posted yesterday. My analysis . In short, whoever is giving him numbers is conflating last year's Farm Bureau report with Walmart's deal price, without even checking if the items and quantities are the same. permalink award report block reply Logan051361 1 points 6 days ago I was Just at Meijer. a large Turkey was 6 Dollars.

They did it with gas, had him saying it was under 2 dollars a gallon for months, now he at least says its \"coming down\" and is around 2.50. They do it with groceries, telling him they are all down. If he gets gas down to actually below 2 dollars it might help the price, but other than that there isn't much he can do. He just needs to STOP telling people that the groceries are \"all down\" because it pisses people off. permalink award report block reply\nBasedMillennial 1 points 6 days ago Inflation shot up 21% under Biden, that year I received a 3% raise. I'm behind 7 years not including ongoing inflation. permalink award report block reply\nMaganifice7 1 points 6 days ago Bullshit. permalink award report block reply\nFreefertilizer 1 points 6 days ago Im sure Trump didn't read the original and new meals and just the headline but this isn't a 1:1 this is just Wal Mart curating a meal year to year. I dont think really anything went down in price just didn't go crazy up in price the last year. Still good we stopped inflation going crazy imo but not 25% permalink award report block reply\nAtheistTrumper 1 points 6 days ago I got pretty much everything I need on sale at Aldi for $40, including the turkey. I think they are trying to capitalize on the no-EBT by advertising low prices. They are selling out quickly but restock every morning and you can just order it for pickup. permalink award report block reply\nGhostOfTheRepublic 1 points 6 days ago Don\u2019t care arrest the fking crooks!!

It takes time to work through the system. Just as both parties are driving America into insane debt. permalink award report block reply\nPoleWatcher 1 points 6 days ago Not sure if agree with that.

You can't make things better if people think things will ONLY get worse, so you need more positivity. Deporting more illegals to reduce demand might help, worth a shot.. permalink award report block reply\nuniformist 1 points 5 days ago Biden got it down 1 cent one year permalink award report block reply\nhoodar 1 points 6 days ago tHe eGg pRiCeS gUyZ...wait they're down.... nevermind, let's forget about them. permalink award report block reply\nHandshake_Shmanshake 1 points 6 days ago This is basically saying, \"I saved you 15 Cents on hotdogs, Jack.\" Gas is almost $5 a gallon where I'm at.

I don't even think Trump did it knowing it was wrong, I think he gets this stupid shit brought to him by advisors and just repeats it. The guy isn't grocery shopping and has no clue. If someone actually gets good info to him he always acts to fix it. He just needs someone giving him the truth. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 0 points 6 days ago how can Trump do better if no one complains about anything? permalink parent award report block reply DeathBattleFan123 1 points 6 days ago Halting Biden era runaway inflation is a big win by itself. Reducing the price of key staples like food and gas by 25% from what they were last year is a massive accomplishment. Complaining that it's not lower than it was 5 years ago in a total of 10 months on the job is unreasonable. We are finally headed in the right direction, and rather than celebrating, people like you are dooming. permalink parent award report block reply NewGovModOnDutyBans 1 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply\nCaptainlizard 1 points 6 days ago It's not anti trump to call out bullshit.
