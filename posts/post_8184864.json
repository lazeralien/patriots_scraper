There was a podcast yesterday where one of Trump's strongest supporters walked through Trumps entire term so far. 2 hour walkthrough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MjEkOKoHcg and the Tl,DR on that is that its fucking dismal.\nHe is failing MAGA on pretty much everything, and most of the things MAGA thinks they are winning on, they are not. USDA is alive and well (less LGBT, instead your tax money is being spent to track and report people in Norway for downloading hentai games), deportations are negligible (especially when you compare those numbers vs. new HB1 visas being handed out) and also how offshoring only accelerated under him, economy is MUCH worse for the average American and getting set for an unprecedented collapse... Barnes is still fully pro-Trump, but frankly when one looks at Trump's actions it very much appears that around the time when he suddenly flopped on Epstein, that was the moment of total sell out of MAGA to the swamp. He actually purged almost all MAGA people from his admin now - he's got Soros shills and warhawks everywhere that matters. permalink parent award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste 1 points 7 hours ago If Trump and GOP don't shape up, Dems are going to take the country back in 2028 I was holding off on this.

But keep in mind, although the H1b problem is real and it's very important, the reason why it's being pushed is because it's being used as a wedge to destroy MAGA. \"This effort to split the MAGA base, using Israel or (insert_next_thing_here) as a wedge issue within the America First movement \u2013 only benefits one larger apparatus, the Sea Island billionaire control system.\" https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2025/11/11/the-2025-maga-fracture-and-the-benefactors-behind-it/ permalink award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 14 points 12 hours ago Is it truly MAGA anymore though if we just throw America totally under the bus for this or any other important issue just to keep some facade of unity? This isn't a minor issue, we've told an entire generation of kids that if they just stuck to STEM, they'd have good jobs and stable lives, just to yank it out from under them and call them lazy and entitled. This is of course after telling the ones before them that we're a service economy now, only to kick them in the balls too and hire illegals instead. The entire younger half of the population and growing is increasingly desperate, angry, and hopeless, and with absolutely good reason. This is why it's so easy for the left to lure them with the siren song of communism, because they don't see any other way forward in our defective dying retarded country. permalink parent award report block reply SuperDuperBasedMD 4 points 11 hours ago I agree. That's why it's a great wedge issue.\nBut you have to decide whether you're going to let them split MAGA or not. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 4 points 10 hours ago Then split it. I don't give a fuck. It was build a wall, now it's \"Americans aren't talented enough to survive without H1B.\" Get the fuck out of here. permalink parent award report block reply aaafirefly123 2 points 11 hours ago Trump\u2019s logic is simple. His #1 issue is businesses leaving America. Therefore he will do ANYTHING to prevent that, even if it means screwing over Americans. H1B indentured servants? Have at it as long as you stay in America. His #1 goal above EVERYTHING is to bring businesses to America. permalink parent award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 11 points 11 hours ago That's such a short-sighted way of thinking. Without Americans, what is America other than a poorly run dirt patch with too many regulations and taxes. permalink parent award report block reply aaafirefly123 7 points 11 hours ago Unfortunately, this is the kind of \u201cpatriotism\u201d that Boomers like Trump exhibit constantly.
