If anything it’s emboldened these violent anarchists. This is a violent group

That is how the right responds to the lefts actions. So many on our side stay complacent, feel validated and move on seeking the next strongly worded letter, and talk of an action to come.

They need antifa cause they need unrest. Who else is raising hell here? Stirring shit up? Definitely not the cowtowed right. The government needs conflict therefore they create it, endlessly. The government (guised as left) frantically imported tens of millions of third worlders during the potato's four years, to give predicate for this administration (guised as right) to do what they are gonna do. Digital ID, Digital $, UBI welfare state. You can see all the pieces falling into place smoothly. All of it crudely choreographed and obvious as fuck. There is One government, and it serves its allegiances elsewhere. Deception is its currency. permalink award report block reply Deporter 2 points 11 hours ago Kash Patel fucking SUCKS 🖕🖕🖕 permalink award report block reply _Sully_ -1 points 19 hours ago I'm not disagreeing with this but Antifa is not labelled a domestic terrorist group. It's not something you announce and that's it. I don't know what the exact process is but it takes more than a month or two. Think of it in a legal sense and how ridiculously long even dead to rights investigations and trials take. You can't make an EO and it becomes enforceable in a federal court in a snap. They have to make sure all the ducks are in a row so that people can't just weasel out of shit over technical details. Not even someone shouting they are antifa could be evidence. They have to define the behaviors and affiliations just like they would for a mob RICO case. Everyone is gonna get all "nothing ever happens"-out before they can actually do anything. All the FBI stuff is based on single events and crimes on camera. That person could very well be an Antifa but they won't have the ability to elevate that shit to terrorist charges related to an actual organization. All that has to be defined and established on legal grounds. We've all been waiting a long fucking time for shit to go down don't let your impatience gas you right when there is an inkling of a chance of something happening. permalink award report block reply SemperFidelis231 4 points 15 hours ago There's actually no legal mechanism or weight behind labelling something a "domestic terror group". Its just not a thing under US law. He could call them the "unicorn fairy mafia" and it'd have the same legal weight behind it. What WOULD carry weight is labelling Antifa as a "foreign terrorist organization". That opens up a whole wide world of fun and exciting things like the PATRIOT Act, and drone strikes. permalink parent award report block reply SCHULTZ 2 points 19 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply
