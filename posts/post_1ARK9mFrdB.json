Many local economies will die, creating all kinds of other issues. And there are not 600,000 FULL PAYING Americans who will just swoop in and fill all those seats. I often use the analogy of the country being very fat, and Trump wants it to get thin again. However, you can't just saw off the country's legs and claim that is a solution to obesity. That is what you will be doing if you suddenly turn off all foreign investment. You have to have the country diet and exercise, slowly working all the fat off in a healthy manner. permalink parent award report block reply Harsh_Truth2 3 points 10 hours ago This country needs Lipo, not a diet plan. permalink parent award report block reply couranto -4 points 17 hours ago Fake Trump never ever said that.
