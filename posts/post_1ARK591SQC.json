They say it\u2019s an \u201cAI error.\u201d But let\u2019s be real, this isn\u2019t a glitch.

This applies doubly in 2025 when Google/YouTube have proven that they don't give a fuck, and don't owe you shit.

Keep mixing up the fun with the difficult. more intense versions on the uncensored platforms. long form content, with receipts, explaining their positions. bro talk, to show it is not just the host/creator with these views. multiple accounts under similar names to flood out the clones attempting to hijack their brand/image. NEVER challenge a much larger influencer until they have their own solid cult personality followers to defend them in the comments. use obscure jokes to mock idealogue opponents before diving deep into the topic. (this is more subtle and not always in the same posts) etc.. many more methods.
