We should massively reduce eligibility for SNAP.\n17 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Elon Walked Away \u2013 Now We Know Why Read More Ads by Ad.Style Marat1792 10 points 4 days ago What gets me about the whole damn thing is that food is already effectively free. Grain prices are so low that a lot of farmers didn't grow anything this year. If people could buy food at market rates, you could literally feed your whole family for the month by checking your sofa for loose change. But instead a loaf of chemistry class bread is heading to 3 dollars. We don't have an affordability problem. We have a racketeering problem. permalink award report block reply utfanx2 4 points 4 days ago Also a regulatory problem or a entrepreneurial problem. permalink parent award report block reply Harvestsmiles 3 points 4 days ago Also a knowledge of how to cook at home problem. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 2 points 4 days ago f people could buy food at market rates I can get a 50 pound bag of flour for just under 20 bucks. A bushel of wheat is 60 pounds and about ~5.50. You are paying for processing, which if you have ever seen a flour mill... its worth that cost. Still fucking cheap. Salt is 50 cents for a pound. Just under 20 bucks plus 50 cents... say 20 dollars 50 pounds of flour becomes about 100 pounds of bread. So with an existing yeast source, that is 20 dollars per 100 pounds of bread. Bread isnt expensive because of \"racketeering\" its expensive because bread goes bad easily and is labor/equipment intensive. permalink parent award report block reply Marat1792 1 points 4 days ago I have tried writing a response a couple of times now. I love looking at all the nitty gritty numbers, so it is easy for me to get side tracked. Here is the reality as I see it. No regular working man in the entire value chain is making more money. Farmers are actually being paid less. The truckers on the farms around me are mostly south africans who are being paid in room and board. The grain elevators and mills are making less money than they were even last year. The grocery stores are still making their same margins. And if we are being totally honest, I SERIOUSLY doubt the people at the bread factories are making any more money than they were last year. But the bread keeps going up in cost even though the input cost is lower. The only thing we are left to assume is that the bread company is increasing their margin because they know they can squeeze us. Same with everything else at the grocery store. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpAndGodWin 1 points 3 days ago For poor bastards with celiac disease they're raped for gf bread that's around $7 for a pathetic loaf. permalink parent award report block reply Pede 4 points 4 days ago I prefer someone just eyeballing it. No weighing, no tape, just fucking look like a normal person and say, yeah you're too fat, here's a multivitamin, don't eat for 3 months.

It would be a huge boon for public health across the board.  Yeah, PE class comes back to haunt them!  Once deemed able, the old system (Obama lifted) that limited able bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) to 3 months of benefits in a 3 year period should take effect again.  It would be more beneficial to just stay in shape rather than have to go through all of this again. permalink award report block reply keeman 1 points 3 days ago Cut food stamps 100% by following the constitution. permalink award report block reply HanginChad 1 points 4 days ago I didn't eat anything today either, nothing yesterday, or the day before.
