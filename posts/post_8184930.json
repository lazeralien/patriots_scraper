ONE OF THE TEENS FIRED BACK\" Ok, so three teens who dindu nuffin armed thugs broke into a man's apartment and got their just reward. Had they gone in unarmed, they probably would have all given up, crying at the sound of the first shot.   But they escalated the situation and shot back, resulting a shootout that left them all dead. Anyway. permalink parent award report block reply 19American62Woman 13 points 7 hours ago I saw a video of boons being primitive. They asked the grandmother about the horrible behavior. I figured there would be a halfway decent response since she was so old but she stated that their behavior was commendable because of their passion.

He was probably so scared for his life!! permalink award report block reply GeorgeBailey 7 points 6 hours ago I only hope that her other 4 to 6 children will lean from this and stick to shoplifting or drug dealing. Armed robbery is just too dangerous of a profession to get into. permalink award report block reply PlantTrees 6 points 6 hours ago The home invaders/burglars brought guns and broke in .. homeowner acted in self defense and should never have even been charged.  The 'authorities' should have ignored the mother of criminals demanding he be charged because victimizing him twice is wrong... If I were litigious I would say he should sue them and her for putting him through that. permalink award report block reply Wakenbake 5 points 6 hours ago Thi article has a picture of the \"neighbor\" so maybe the aame one but it doesnt describe breaking entering but a robbey in the front yard? https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/conyers/conyers-attempted-robbery/85-d344d527-7110-4d98-b06e-d655c76c7ab0 permalink award report block reply T471 5 points 6 hours ago yes justified.

I don't blame him for putting 9 rounds into each sack of shit. permalink award report block reply edxzxz 2 points 4 hours ago I'm 100% fine with this vet defending himself in his home, but 28 rounds fired would require him having more than 2 fully loaded guns or several extra magazines and reloading during the chaos of 3 armed thugs breaking into his home.  Guy had to have been pretty cool under fire.  He should sue the mothers of these thugs for damage to his home and costs of ammo. permalink parent award report block reply Maga305_47 3 points 6 hours ago Mother of the year. permalink award report block reply JiggsawCalrissian 2 points 6 hours ago Step 1: dont break in to people's homes Let's work on that before deciding if what this man did was too much or too little or just enough permalink award report block reply Lol_Garrus 2 points 5 hours ago AI slop.
