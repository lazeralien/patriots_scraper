Also, let me tell you something that will blow your fucking mind about Ukraine. You ready? This is going to seem trivial and inconsequential to you but... imagine... you could only wear ONE pair of pants for the next 10 years because pants are hard to buy. You can't find pants. You have to go to a big city to even find two different styles of pants. Or you have to shop on alibaba.

They won't let you register your kid without proof of a host of vaccines. Its no one's goddamn business what shots my kid has had or not had. If your kid had theirs and you trust it then its supposed to be a shield so my kid couldn't infect yours. Its not an \"everyone needs to take it to make it work for anyone\" thing. permalink award report block reply zooty 10 points 4 days ago Follow the money and you'll end back at the pharma industry, guaranteed.

But I bet you'll find it in these school mandates too. In a way, they're worse.

I don't see vaccine administration as an enumerated power of the federal government so this should be done solely by the states. Let's bring the federal government back to only it's enumerated powers. permalink award report block reply Sh1nyH4ppy 3 points 4 days ago If you read and/or watched, Dr Malone actually said the word revoked:\n\u201cHe wants to know whether or not there\u2019s actual science behind that entire schedule, and whether or not it needs to be reconsidered or even revoked.\u201d permalink award report block reply keeman 3 points 4 days ago Which part of the Constitution gives the fedgov permission to create a vaccine schedule?  Which part authorizes the FDA or CDC to exist or to require prescriptions or drug authorization?  Why to we the people put up with this shit? permalink award report block reply TrumpAndGodWin 2 points 4 days ago Good news is that depending on the poll, 40 to 80% of Americans don't trust the CDC. permalink parent award report block reply unotrumpcard 3 points 4 days ago Trump, the 79 year old consideroor. \"Im gonna considooooor\" permalink award report block reply FreedomFlowerDelta 3 points 4 days ago If you so much as trip and fall on my property, I am liable for lifelong injuries.

YES. Let people make informed decisions. Yeah, I want to stick this needle in my kid, no I don't want to stick that needle in my kid, no I don't want to stick any needles in my kid and play the survival lottery. Bring back freedom of fucking association. Just get government the fuck out of EVERYTHING related to healthcare. They do not know what the fuck they are doing and when they DO know, half the time it's to fuck YOU over. It's none of their fucking business how you treat your kid until they turn 18 or if they can even read or eat dirt or not. Not your kid, not your problem, deal with them however you will once they turn 18. If their dumb ass dies of cholera, so be it. If their dumb ass gets shot by another citizen because they robbed a 7/11, the more the fucking merrier. I guarantee I can protect my family better than the government can. In every which way except for communists. I still, as of yet, have not found a personal solution to communists. But every fucking other problem, I can take care of myself. ALL problems, I can deal with myself. No challenge too great, no toilet water pipe too dirty. Except communists, because those have to be eradicated by the millions and I can't save up enough money to nuke their fucking ass out of the atmosphere to be scattered to the solar winds they came from. I do not need to be taxed for anything except the eradication of every communist in every crevice of this planet. But I'll settle for exterminating all of them here at home. I will work for MY PEOPLE, the American people, for free, out of the goodness of my heart, educating them on how to keep their kids safe - if that's what it has to come to. You don't have to put a gun to my head to take money out of my pocket to tell my neighbor you're going to burn their fucking kids to a crisp if they don't vaxx them. permalink award report block reply AgnesDomini 2 points 4 days ago Let's fucking gooooooo already!

Do you want to answer your own question? I feel like you know the answer to that. I know the answer, you know the answer. Maybe some people that drive by don't know the answer. So let's talk about it! permalink parent award report block reply ThisIsHowItStarts 1 points 4 days ago But discounted Ozempic for everyone permalink award report block reply Cuttinmuffins 1 points 4 days ago Trump considers, Trump suggests, Trump asks for help, Trump pleads, Trump threatens. Sorry, didn't vote for Trump to ask for help from the people I voted for Trump to prosecute and toss in prison. This admin has been nothing but empty threats, broke promises, and buried conspiracy with Israel the only party to actually get anything out of it. What happened to MAGA, to I will prosecute election fraud, mass deportation, arrests and prosecution of Antifa, some kind of benefit for the people that suffered 4 years of torture, starvation, and beatings for standing up for him in 2020, to throwing the crooked pols in the Dem and rep party in prison for good? We get Trust Graham, he never lets us down? We got three years to kick Trump in his ass to get the fuck to work. Standing around pretending anything he has done is of any consequence to this point is idiotic to say the least. As soon as the left is back in power, and Trump just told you all \"if and when they take back power\", this country is done. USSA with all the murder, starvation, and death that every color revolution has brought along with it will befall the American people. Will befall YOU.  So call me black pilled or whatever lefty type label you can apply to close people's eyes, but know, this is what approaches, and we have little time, but enough time at this point, to stop it. permalink award report block reply JesusTheOnlyWay 1 points 4 days ago Considers...

Also should be a parent\u2019s choice. And yes. Some vaccines should be necessary to attend public schools. Better to homeschool anyway. But let\u2019s face it. We bred generations of parents that are incapable. Would be great to reverse that honestly. Start with virtual public school if you can. permalink award report block reply ingrowntoenail -7 points 4 days ago No.  Pre-covid vaccines save lives.

Why can't a company just make a drug and sell it to you and you buy it? What the fuck is we axing here? Don't answer that, it's rhetorical question. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 5 points 4 days ago No. I just thought they were misguided. But they have questions which deserve answers, especially since it turns out that the 'trust the science' people often skip the science part. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 3 points 4 days ago Good luck proving that.  Big Pharma controls the info and Big Pharma says 'vaccines' save lives.  \"Safe and effective.\"  See where I'm going with this? permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 1 points 4 days ago DO THEY tho?

There, I've solved the mystery for you. Their average salary is like 1000 to 1500 euros a month. They pay 4-600 euros in rent. Look up the average ukrainian hruschinka or stalinka apartment. Don't pay attention to those coked up fuckheads driving ferraris off laundered NATO money. They drink vodka and eat RAW FAT and still can't get fat because they're STILL in a caloric deficit. Also, let me tell you something that will blow your fucking mind about Ukraine. You ready? This is going to seem trivial and inconsequential to you but... imagine... you could only wear ONE pair of pants for the next 10 years because pants are hard to buy. You can't find pants. You have to go to a big city to even find two different styles of pants. Or you have to shop on alibaba. Do you think your ass would A. get fatter and fatter, changing pant sizes every month until by month 4 you had to LITERALLY walk outside in the freezing cold in nothing but your underwear or ...

Yeah, I want to stick this needle in my kid, no I don't want to stick that needle in my kid, no I don't want to stick any needles in my kid and play the survival lottery. Bring back freedom of fucking association. Just get government the fuck out of EVERYTHING related to healthcare. They do not know what the fuck they are doing and when they DO know, half the time it's to fuck YOU over. It's none of their fucking business how you treat your kid until they turn 18 or if they can even read or eat dirt or not. Not your kid, not your problem, deal with them however you will once they turn 18. If their dumb ass dies of cholera, so be it. If their dumb ass gets shot by another citizen because they robbed a 7/11, the more the fucking merrier. I guarantee I can protect my family better than the government can. In every which way except for communists. I still, as of yet, have not found a personal solution to communists. But every fucking other problem, I can take care of myself. ALL problems, I can deal with myself. No challenge too great, no toilet water pipe too dirty. Except communists, because those have to be eradicated by the millions and I can't save up enough money to nuke their fucking ass out of the atmosphere to be scattered to the solar winds they came from. I do not need to be taxed for anything except the eradication of every communist in every crevice of this planet. But I'll settle for exterminating all of them here at home. I will work for MY PEOPLE, the American people, for free, out of the goodness of my heart, educating them on how to keep their kids safe - if that's what it has to come to. You don't have to put a gun to my head to take money out of my pocket to tell my neighbor you're going to burn their fucking kids to a crisp if they don't vaxx them. permalink award report block reply\nAgnesDomini 2 points 4 days ago Let's fucking gooooooo already!

Sorry, didn't vote for Trump to ask for help from the people I voted for Trump to prosecute and toss in prison. This admin has been nothing but empty threats, broke promises, and buried conspiracy with Israel the only party to actually get anything out of it. What happened to MAGA, to I will prosecute election fraud, mass deportation, arrests and prosecution of Antifa, some kind of benefit for the people that suffered 4 years of torture, starvation, and beatings for standing up for him in 2020, to throwing the crooked pols in the Dem and rep party in prison for good? We get Trust Graham, he never lets us down? We got three years to kick Trump in his ass to get the fuck to work. Standing around pretending anything he has done is of any consequence to this point is idiotic to say the least. As soon as the left is back in power, and Trump just told you all \"if and when they take back power\", this country is done. USSA with all the murder, starvation, and death that every color revolution has brought along with it will befall the American people. Will befall YOU.
