Lets have a 20% of the H1B-visa employee's salary as a federal fee.  Use the federal fee to fund masters level college courses for US citizens but only with "real" "practical" majors like computer science or EE or other engineering majors. permalink award report block reply 62jawbill 1 points 7 hours ago Trump surrounded himself with media whores. permalink award report block reply Be_The_Change 1 points 9 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply
