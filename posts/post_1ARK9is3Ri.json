I worked at a high-end grocery store in my area, and we still got EBT trash goblins coming through.  Being a cashier for them for a few years made me HATE all food stamp recipients.  They'd come through with carts full of sushi, high-end steaks, junk food, and $100+ specialty cakes from the bakery.  They were worse than the CEO's-wife-Karens.

The first of the month our trucks were around 2200 cases but closer to the end of the month they\u2019d be around 700. I remember the first of the month every night coming into a ransacked department. The shelves were totally trashed. You\u2019d have to sit there and sort out all the cans and boxes, etc. and don\u2019t get me started on the koolaid packets.

I was front end in the early 2000\u2019s and sometimes the EBT system would go down for about 10 minutes. People would be losing their minds having to wait a minute for it to reboot.
