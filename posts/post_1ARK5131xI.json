Because nothing will ever happen to anyone. 4 years of Russia Russia Russia, and zero arrest, those riggers that stole Georgia on video got $140 million defamation lawsuit on Gulianni, Colorado lady exposing voter fraud arrested. So why am I supposed to give a whoop, when Dems/leftist can rob/kill/cheat, and nothing ever happens? Trump is too nice.

The money is too good, they are not at risk of being held accountable beyond MAYBE getting removed from office while retaining all of their stolen assets, and they'll just be positioned to another lucrative job behind the scenes when things quiet down.

Also.. wtf is the point of democracy?? Isnt the point to do stuff for the majority of your constituents?? You have the left bending ass backwards for trannies which are 0.01% of population. Then you have the right who is opening their mouth for a cleveland steamer from israel.. Democracy.. even a republic is a failed concept at this point. Especially with all the other systems manipulating people, aka social media. permalink award report block reply current_horror 1 points 6 days ago Democracy is how the elites launder their tyranny so that you don\u2019t storm their castles. permalink parent award report block reply alucard13mmfmj 1 points 6 days ago Yeah.

They're above the law and that's why these geriatric career criminal politicians REFUSE to leave office, despite being incapable of doing their job effectively. The money is too good, they are not at risk of being held accountable beyond MAYBE getting removed from office while retaining all of their stolen assets, and they'll just be positioned to another lucrative job behind the scenes when things quiet down. They get golden parachutes no matter how they leave office. permalink award report block reply\njml1997 1 points 6 days ago If it's funded by the government, technically it can't be an NGO.
