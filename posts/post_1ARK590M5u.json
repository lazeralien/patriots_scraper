I'm convinced if there is anything close to a 50/50 split, it's bullshit. They've been rigging since Reagan beat the shit out of them in the 80s. From HW Bush, they've been fucking with elections.

Drug illegalization is progressivist bullshit and if we want to truly drain the swamp we need to kick it aside.  You wanna fuck yourself up with drugs that is a you thing.  The rest of us can regulate societal behavior by mocking it. permalink parent award report block reply Klown_Kutz 3 points 3 days ago Yeah no. Take this tired old Libertopian bullshit elsewhere. It will never make America great. permalink parent award report block reply Washington_Redskins 1 points 3 days ago If all drugs were completely legal methamphetamines and Fentanyl would devastate American society the same way opium did to China during the Opium Wars.Considering the million plus that have been killed by Fentanyl and meth, the USA would be justified in using nuclear weapons against the countries making the.drugs. Other countries would be reluctant to make drugs to send to America if they knew they were going to get nuked. permalink parent award report block reply BaronFalcon 2 points 3 days ago That's the same thing they said about alcohol. Take your moral legislation somewhere else. permalink parent award report block reply Washington_Redskins 1 points 3 days ago The reality of history shows otherwise. Even small amounts of legalization such as in Portland have created much worse disasters with far more deaths. Legalizing things like Fentanyl and meth doesn't help. It's not about morality it's about reality. Alcohol can also debilitate but it does not kill and devastate Society as much as Fentanyl and meth do despite what all the people who hate alcohol say. Please take your this is about legislating morality opinion elsewhere as that is absolutely not what this is about. permalink parent award report block reply OldZilla 49 points 4 days ago Somebody please explain why after Kari Lake pointing this shit out that nobody had done anything about these cheating fucks.

What kind of idiot would make an error like that? It's not even plausible.  The excuse is lamer than the admission. permalink award report block reply lefty295 3 points 4 days ago Not saying you\u2019re a lier, but I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a truther either. permalink award report block reply Washington_Redskins 2 points 3 days ago We all might have several thousand totes that are full of ballots that we found and should send to Maricopa County that are just as a legitimate permalink award report block reply MAGA-Fett 2 points 3 days ago My dad works in the Maricopa County elections. He says the US Post Office sent back many boxes of ballots from houses that the voter no longer lives there. Probably something near 250k ballots. The whole process is so broken for this dumb \u201call mail in ballot\u201d election. permalink award report block reply Steve56775 1 points 3 days ago If you want to vote multiple times in Nevada just go to any apartment complex when ballots are mailed. The community mailboxes are littered with them. Collect as many as you want and mail them in. Make sure all the illegals get handful. permalink parent award report block reply joesfbi 2 points 4 days ago Every time I think about moving to Arizona, Maricopa County reminds why its a bad idea. permalink award report block reply Rosebud4Jesus 2 points 4 days ago Has Trump put anyone in charge of Elections and Election Fraud?\nTo clean voter rolls, etc.  He needs someone who is MAGA and believes the 2020 election was stolen. permalink award report block reply RexCollumSilvarum 1 points 4 days ago The Deputy Elections Director is named Jennifer...
