23 We spend $100 billion a year on EBT, WIC, etc. You could build a real scaled city that looks like Minas Tirith for a third of that price posted 3 hours ago by MasterChief08 2 comments award share report block Obviously I'm doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations, but Minas Tirith was 7 concentric half circles that housed 150,000 people with a horizontal footprint of roughly 1.5–2 square kilometers. A small city could be built for $30 billion - with the walls, infrastructure and buildings all completed within a decade.

A bunch of obese parasitic women hiding their shoplifted items benefit a carriage full of food I paid for... it twists my stomach.
