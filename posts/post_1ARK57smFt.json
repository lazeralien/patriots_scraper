That means home prices go UP massively. Great for a wealthy real estate tycoon like Trump, horrible for the average buyer. This would not open the door to home ownership for millions, it would close the door on them.\n55 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save loooooof 12 points 4 days ago Being permanent usury chattel.  \"You will own nothing and be happy\". permalink award report block reply Patriot4TN 4 points 4 days ago That rolls around in 2030. permalink parent award report block reply E-dantes 2 points 4 days ago This exactly. permalink parent award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 1 points 4 days ago I'd do it.
