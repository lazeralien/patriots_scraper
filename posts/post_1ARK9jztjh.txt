After all, free speech doesn’t extend to criticism of Israel! permalink parent award report block reply TrumpDupedMAGA 0 points 1 day ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply HoodooOperator 0 points 1 day ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply teleomorph 17 points 1 day ago This obnoxious douch is being sued for slander, not "criticizing Israel" as he blatantly lies about in this post. It's open and shut slander case.  He called her a honeypot with zero evidence a dozen times on X, and very blatantly in the repost he's describing. It's not an "attack on free speech" from "Kash's inner circle", it's a private civil case from a private citizen. But it's another excellent opportunity for him to grift!  Send him your money!! permalink award report block reply snoopy3210 5 points 1 day ago He’s a known liar and evil propagandist, pushed people into capitol on J6 so they get arrested : Elijah Schaffer “We are doing a revolution!!!!” Aaaaaand never went to jail despite going inside. Framed MAGA and plaided “journalism”. 100% protected by intel. permalink parent award report block reply teleomorph 0 points 1 day ago 100% protected by intel. Personally, I doubt that.  I think he's just a revolting person.  And revolting people have no trouble building an audience online. permalink parent award report block reply snoopy3210 1 points 1 day ago False. He’s on all the hoaxes made by intel using his platform to peddle them for that agency. He even tried to mislead

Just another example of a Jew-hater getting their just desserts. permalink parent award report block reply HoodooOperator -1 points 22 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply NoticesBugleOWO 1 points 22 hours ago I'm Aryan as fuck and Catholic, faggot. permalink parent award report block reply Steve56775 12 points 1 day ago If only Patel would arrest some Real criminals. We have a stolen election to rectify, an autopen presidency, and out of control Judiciary. Nothing happening on the western front, just attacking a constitutional right. permalink award report block reply lifeisahologram 10 points 1 day ago I didnt know if she was a honey pot before but I do now because of her lawsuit. She told on herself. permalink award report block reply TheTelltaleFly 9 points 1 day ago She’s also suing noted FBI whistleblower and former friend of Patel and Bongino Kyle Seraphin for the exact same thing and the exact same amount, though Kyle only read the comment by someone else and never made the claim himself. It’s worth noting that as soon as Kash and Dan got to the FBI they immediately quit talking to Kyle. Maybe because Kyle did the initial surveillance on the now-known pipe bomber, who Kash seems hell-bent on protecting. It seems like no matter what we do, our government will always be against us. permalink parent award report block reply GrumpleAl 1 points 1 day ago So if she wouldn't have sued you could say, "See, if she wasn't a honeypot she would have sued." Issuing a lawsuit proves absolutely nothing. permalink parent award report block reply lifeisahologram 1 points 1 day ago Did you even watch the video? lol permalink parent award report block reply 62jawbill 8 points 1 day ago Pajeet, taking care of the important things. permalink award report block reply CyanScales 6 points 1 day ago If he didnt do anything else, then he should win his case. If they are suing, then they think they have a case and he is leaving something out. permalink award report block reply Cuntgoblin 4 points 1 day ago And just like that the FBI Director's communications are subject to Discovery. Great job! permalink award report block reply TrumpVoter1 3 points 1 day ago wheres the proof or are you just content to take the word of a random? permalink award report block reply curiousorganelle 2 points 1 day ago This is sure to restore Alexis Wilkins reputation and end all suspicion that she is an israeli honeypot.. ;) permalink award report block reply RoosterRaiser 1 points 1 day ago How is this any different then Melania suing those who slander her?

Those cases are cheered. permalink award report block reply Goozmania 0 points 1 day ago It's not different. permalink parent award report block reply DrCowboyPresident 1 points 1 day ago Did anyone think they were going to be allowed to have their own political movement? lololol permalink award report block reply Hangmhigh 0 points 1 day ago didnt know about this kash situation but now I do.

Oh, but this is the girlfriend of Kash Patel and he said Epstein killed himself, so this is the worst thing that ever happened. permalink award report block reply Porkbut -4 points 1 day ago Eljiahs just crying out as he strikes, no big deal. permalink parent award report block reply Grindelwald -8 points 1 day ago Then don’t slander. permalink award report block reply Deplorable_Yankee 10 points 1 day ago I’ll remember that the next time I see an X post from a person with a last name ending in Berg or Stein telling everybody white peopje are evil and toxic. Sound good? permalink parent award report block reply Grindelwald 0 points 1 day ago No idea what you are talking about. He posts her picture next to someone else’s X post referencing federal officials being compromised. Then he says he did not slander her.  Then why TF did he do what he did?  She should sue him.  He should defend his actions and both should have the court sort it out. And he should not whine about it. permalink parent award report block reply RatsoBergStein -2 points 1 day ago Fuck you. Namist. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut -3 points 1 day ago You should sue them if you feel youve been slandered, stop being a faggoty pussy about it. permalink parent award report block reply Deplorable_Yankee 5 points 1 day ago When the judge says I have no case because I’m not rich like portnoy, what then smart guy. Fuck off, you know what I’m saying is true. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut -3 points 1 day ago Its not my fault youre poor, sucks to suck. So you just want to larp and screech like a faggot or a woman on their period then?
