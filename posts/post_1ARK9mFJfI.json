Any company hiring tons of illegals while meeting the technical requirement to use e-verify gets constantly raided by ice until they cut the shit and make a good faith effort.

It\u2019s not the business sector\u2019s job to fix the government\u2019s broken verification system. Companies follow the laws and systems they\u2019re given.

Instead of charging interest, they rent to own at a fixed final price that basically packs interest into the payment but you don't get a discount for paying early since it's not interest. permalink parent award report block reply borisborscht 1 points 9 hours ago who would offer that loan and why why would they loan out money at 0% interest? permalink parent award report block reply Knowthyself 2 points 8 hours ago Many banks do. Charging intrest is forbidden under Shria law. Therefor they can get personal loans and only pay back then principle. permalink parent award report block reply Side_o_beef_curtains 1 points 6 hours ago Interest is forbidden in islam. permalink parent award report block reply ShadowInv 1 points 8 hours ago There are also 0% loans for jews from major banks. permalink parent award report block reply RYTHMICRIOT 11 points 19 hours ago Just ban commercial landscaping. Rake your own damn leaves. Itd be a good start permalink award report block reply PiratePatriotParrot OP 12 points 19 hours ago Everywhere I drive in my town is Mexicans out on the streets landscaping every inch of every road for 100s of miles. No joke. I nearly got a head-on crash this week because a blower guy was in the road. There must be a good 1000-3000 of them out there a time just on the public roads let alone any of the private houses and businesses. There's maybe 20-100k gardeners in my town. who knows. permalink parent award report block reply lixa 4 points 18 hours ago I live on a street that unfortunately has very little in the way of greenery. Other than a tiny strip of grass in the front, (on some properties, but few), the rest is all concrete. And yet every building has a team of lawn guys who come weekly to do who knows what other than blow dust into the adjacent properties. It's like money laundering or something permalink parent award report block reply Husky 2 points 10 hours ago My company's parking lot has a bed of pebbles adjacent to the parking lot. Every week Mexicans take weed eaters to this bed if rocks with no weeds andnscatter the rocks across the parking lot. Im convinced their contract is to damage my vehicle, not to remove weeds permalink parent award report block reply The_Bloofy_Bullshark 6 points 18 hours ago Our neighborhood hires a landscaping crew that is seemingly here 4 days out of the week but gets absolutely nothing accomplished. We have massive Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) everywhere that they just look at then wander off. All these fucks do is stand around and occasionally blow some leaves around to give off the impression that they are actually doing anything. permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 7 points 18 hours ago Hiring too. Anyone hiring them should be financially and criminally punished permalink award report block reply Aggrieved03 3 points 18 hours ago How about hiring them or supporting them? permalink award report block reply Lamech_Slade 3 points 9 hours ago Make it illegal to sell property or finance loans to non US citizens.  Illegals are only a small part of the problem compared to \"legal\" immigration. permalink award report block reply borisborscht 4 points 9 hours ago I don't want to live in Jeetville either. permalink parent award report block reply Redpilled2Depression 2 points 13 hours ago It\u2019s so simple, why is it not being done? permalink award report block reply covok48 2 points 8 hours ago But hey, Trump aid those H1B streetshitters are a-ok to take the place of illegals. permalink award report block reply TheBasedFriscoMan 2 points 12 hours ago A small suburb in Dallas tried that and lost.  Now Farmers Branch is filled with illegal aliens.  20 to a house.  Cars and trucks parked everywhere on the streets. See Villas at Parkside Partners v.

This would just result in all of the illegals being concentrated in blue states. So, not much different from how things are right now. The only acceptable solution is deportation. permalink award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 1 points 15 hours ago And make the stakes significant. Same for employment. Jail time and huge fine permalink award report block reply borisborscht 1 points 9 hours ago Yes please permalink award report block reply MagaJay02 0 points 18 hours ago That wouldn't make home prices drop 50% lol... bit it'd still lower demand, which helps guaranteed. permalink award report block reply SCHULTZ 1 points 19 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\nAbovethefray 41 points 19 hours ago Also;  when do employers get arrested for hiring illegal aliens?
