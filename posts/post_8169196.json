But. It's still 50~75% more expensive than it was pre covid. They really fucked us with that one and since it was a global disruption there really isn't much Trump can do to expedite a return to those price levels. Gradual decrease is the best we will see for a while yet possibly a decade. permalink parent award report block reply dr_gonzo 20 points 7 days ago No this is absolutely NOT true. We must do what happened in the 80s and create massive economic growth to make wages outpace what was lost to inflation. So what must be done to accomplish that? Well that's where we have problems because the Republicans no longer stand for liberty-centric economic policy, but if you did these 4 things, you would almost immediately see the 10% growth rates of the 19th century return: End the federal reserve and put us back on the gold standard to restrict future government spending and slam the brakes on inflation ELIMINATE socialist social welfare programs. That would include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and especially WELFARE. Congrats, you just saved 4.6 trillion a year in federal spending RE-abolish our progressive income tax. With this one, the 50% of Americans that actually pay income taxes after credits and deductions, just got a very significant raise which is what would encourage the economic growth Eliminate 90% of the fascistic regulatory state that was never supposed to exist in the first place and imposes 80,000 pages of regulations on Americans conducting business. That now consists of 2.5 MILLION bureaucrats. That number should be less than 100k when you're done If you do those 4 things, we return to the economy we THRIVED under for well over a century and produced the largest economic explosion in world history. In just 4 years time our GDP would go from 27 trillion to over 40 trillion. That's a 60k raise for every American, assuming it was distributed equally which admittedly wouldn't happen, but it gives you an idea of how much wealth is being lost to socialist bullshit. And all we need to do is return to our liberty-centric economic roots. permalink parent award report block reply DatTrumpDoh 7 points 7 days ago That second bullet is DOA. Even many conservative voters are against repealing those programs. permalink parent award report block reply ImportantPerson 5 points 7 days ago It's DOA because any moron that suggests getting rid of all social programs entirely is a fucking moron that doesn't understand the impact of why these programs exist in the first place.  Our GDP would not by skyrocketing because of this and ignorantly looking solely at translating the cost into deficit reduction is just bafflingly wrong. permalink parent award report block reply Glory-Unto-God 1 points 7 days ago Would take a dictator to get it done.

There's too many dollars out there at this point and not enough gold to cover a gold standard and maintain the global currency status. That global standing has been what has insulated the USD since we left the GS and we're too far gone from it at this point to return. permalink parent award report block reply Tmntnyc 1 points 6 days ago Corporate profits are through the fucking roof. The wealth never trickles down to wages. Never. Boeing CEO just testified last year in Congress and admitted he got a 45% raise last year (38 million). The 500 machinists at Boeing  saw a 1% raise over 8 years. The wealth never trickles down automatically. You have to fight for it with unions or labor regulations or we would be paid in fucking scrips if they could permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 6 days ago Corporate profits are through the fucking roof.

It's the reason your retirement account just keeps on growing. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments... dunkeaters 8 points 7 days ago With an expanding money supply it isn't possible to return to pre covid prices. The goal is to grow the real economy (wages vs. inflation) so that consumer prices return to the same relative proportion of income they used to be. permalink parent award report block reply SquiggyMcPepe 3 points 7 days ago Oh we will never see a complete return of course. But corporate margins are thick and there is plenty of room to narrow them if the proper 'incentives' are applied. One of the main tools will be to abolish the lobby. Completely. The main reason corps have grown out of control is because they bought the people who make the rules and laws and turned them in their favor. permalink parent award report block reply CJ74U2NV 7 points 7 days ago Those prices are inflationary adjustments to the Democrats living wage mantra. Every piece of crap unskilled worker is now making a lot of money. Because of that, the costs are passed along to the consumer. Then the Democrats will cry. We need more livable wage increases which will in turn drive prices up even further. After while, the economy collapses and you going to a depression. But that's what Democrats want. So they can have the government take everything over. It will make FDRs new deal look like mother Gooseland. permalink parent award report block reply flashersenpai 8 points 7 days ago Every piece of crap unskilled worker is now making a lot of money. they aren't, and lovely of you to describe them as pieces of crap. loser country club republican in action permalink parent award report block reply EDDIT_IS_CUCKED 2 points 7 days ago All of the people that work at fast food establishments are hired on making more money than I did out of college with a STEM degree 15 years ago. So yes, they are making a shitload of money, actually. Unless your argument is that these are skilled workers. If that's the case, we have a wildly different opinion of the term. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... Hanging_Chad 2 points 7 days ago have you seen government workers lately? permalink parent award report block reply Isolated_Patriot 4 points 7 days ago since it was a global disruption It's not the global disruption that is the problem, it's the number of US of A dollars printed in that time. Inflation WILL NOT DISAPPEAR. It's not going to magically revert to the number of dollars that existed pre-covid unless someone starts incinerating them. A strong economy that starts paying wages to supplement the difference is the ONLY solution to counter the inflation that isn't outright magical. Until people understand this, they are going to continue to yell at clouds about how \"Trump hasn't fixed anything yet!!!!\" permalink parent award report block reply bigbadchows2 4 points 7 days ago Been seeing Buter ball for .99 a pound. We actually did Prime Rib last year due to Turkey being over 2 a pound. I had purchased several who 13 bone prime rib for 5 a pound and the boys and I preferred it to Turkey. This year we got a Turkey, I hope day after Ham roasts are cheap my dogs always get a full ham for major holidays. However, I will never see the .49 a pound I paid 2019, I switched to pork loin, they don't really gaf what the get. I do agree, Trump has limited tools on reducing prices, we did however have some price leveling after the zirp o8-12 inflation. Not holding my breath but we are doing well on gas, so maybe in time it will freeze or come down a point or 2. permalink parent award report block reply Granny 4 points 7 days ago Yes I'm getting a butterball for.99\u00a2 a pound. Last year was $1.19/lb. permalink parent award report block reply bigbadchows2 2 points 6 days ago Was almost 2 where I live and in 1 store it was working on 3. 1.19 is 20%, but nothing to get excited about. permalink parent award report block reply SquiggyMcPepe 2 points 7 days ago Meat is still fairly easy to get on the cheap and if you vacuum seal it before freezing you can load up during a particularly deep sale and have meat for months or even years. As a test I took a store bought vacuum sealed pork loin and let it set at the bottom of the freezer for three years. Thawed it and made a roast and it was just as fresh and tender as it would have been had I made it the day I bought it. permalink parent award report block reply CJ74U2NV 2 points 7 days ago Or from a local butcher. You'll get better quality, a cheaper price, and you're supporting local businesses. The meat is definitely not purchased from overseas. permalink parent award report block reply load 7 more comments...

WTF permalink parent award report block reply chickeninoven 2 points 7 days ago hand out with finger pointing into palm permalink parent award report block reply ImportantPerson 1 points 7 days ago I just paid $3.50 for a pound of ground beef.  That's the lowest it's been in a decade.  Eggs are back to being one of the cheapest healthy meal you can buy.  Chicken has been stable even throughout COVID. The only people who aren't seeing any changes are people buying marketing, not products.  The \"grass fed\" beef isn't going to go down in price.  The organic whatever is not going down in price.  These products are targeting the stupid and ignorant. If you aren't seeing any changes, then go to a different grocery store because you are getting screwed where you are going now. permalink parent award report block reply The_Nowhere_Man 1 points 7 days ago All of them in my town and the town next to mine are within a few pennies of each other on meat prices. Lower than it was right after 2020 but far from being brag worthy. Pound of the cheap hamburger is like $6-something. I go to the local butcher instead and get it for $4-something a pound. permalink parent award report block reply NotYourMan 7 points 7 days ago Food inflation is bad right now.  Remember in 2021 democrats printed $5 trillion dollars and the \"fake\" Inflation Reduction Act.  Both of these caused a 20% increase in food cost accumulative.  But the real inflation is over 45% because of energy and housing.  Trump is fixing the energy but the food prices are staying around.  Remember when democrats decided to shutdown \"the supply chain\" for six months to one year.  That also caused a delayed increase in food cost that we are suffering from now.  ITS THE DEMOCRATS FAULT. permalink parent award report block reply Bythrfruitsyknow 3 points 7 days ago Good job the Republicans got back in office and immediately cut the trillion dollar deficits, amirite? permalink parent award report block reply PitfallHarry 3 points 7 days ago It is true.

Dude hasn\u2019t shopped for food a day in his life. And he can afford any thing he wants. Prices are not down at grocery stores. permalink award report block reply KrakenWakin4JoeBacon 25 points 7 days ago Yeah, not gonna lie\u2026 it rubs me the wrong way when he brags about the greatly improved affordability at the grocery store. It\u2019s not about butter being 25 cents less expensive than it was a year ago. No one gives a shit about paying 25 cents more or less for a single item. It\u2019s about the cumulative cost of the 30 items in my grocery cart, and the fact I\u2019ll fill up my cart with 30+ items that I need to purchase not once per month but multiple times per month. So it\u2019s about the reality that grocery shopping costs a shitload. As a whole, it\u2019s too expensive. And if it\u2019s improving, that\u2019s great \u2014 but \u2014 it is not less expensive to any significant degree. Trump needs to become aware of this & someone in his admin is dropping the fucking ball by not letting him know. He should not be using reduced prices as a positive talking point because people aren\u2019t feeling it. To many I\u2019m sure it\u2019s perceived as gaslighting. permalink parent award report block reply Hattmall -2 points 7 days ago There's very little Trump can do to influence demand based branded products. As long as people pay the inflated prices the price will remain high. The reality is that staple goods and generic items are as cheap or cheaper than pre-pandemic. I buy a lot of groceries and have been closely monitoring these prices for a decade. So no something like Doritos or Digorno frozen pizza isn't going to get cheaper unless demand drops. Which delaying SNAP payments may have a nice impact.  Eggs,Beef and orange juice are still high but price disruptions have always been a thing.  Milk, cheese, oats, flour, fruit, vegetables, canned goods, chicken, turkey, seafood, yogurt, potatoes, other juices, are all down. Coffee and bread are at the upper end of normal pricing. Nuts are variable, remaining somewhat high but within normal bounds. permalink parent award report block reply DrWeeGee 5 points 7 days ago This. permalink parent award report block reply logan34 4 points 7 days ago 25% down? where exactly??? permalink parent award report block reply ImportantPerson -3 points 7 days ago Prices are down.  If you don't see it, then you need to go to different grocery stores.  I don't know what to tell you but you are getting duped if you are still paying outrageous prices for common items. Right now, I can search 4 different grocery stores that are in my area.  All 4 of them have different prices for common items.  A dozen eggs cost $4 at one store and $2 at another store.  Beef is $3.50 at one store and $6 at another. When we were growing up, we would check for coupons and sales and buy those items.  So many people now go to the store and buy the same items regardless of if they are on sale or have any coupons.  A fool and their money... permalink parent award report block reply tribunabessica 30 points 7 days ago Who feeds him these bulshit numbers? permalink award report block reply flashersenpai 11 points 7 days ago i have no proof but i don't like wiles so I'll blame her lol permalink parent award report block reply gottarememberpasswor 8 points 7 days ago I would genuinely love to know permalink parent award report block reply Imnotnorm 2 points 7 days ago Suzy Wiles and Lindsay Graham permalink parent award report block reply bumpman 1 points 7 days ago Prices are actually recently dropping but it\u2019s because ebt didn\u2019t go out this month, plus gov employees are not working, plus I also noticed a lot less illegals st the store lately All of these factors mean higher supply + lower demand, which means cutring prices to move inventory permalink parent award report block reply Obambi 0 points 7 days ago Women permalink parent award report block reply Bldg_2019 27 points 7 days ago For every 12% increase in EBT use from 21-24, there was a 1% increase in the price of food. EBT increased during that period by about 150%. There are other factors, but that\u2019s a BIG one. permalink award report block reply Captainlizard 17 points 7 days ago Finally someone says it. EBT increases grocery prices just as federal government loans increase the price of higher education.

It's like Section 8 where there is a distorted market.

It's been out of control price hikes over here at Walmart. So I'm pressing F to doubt. Maybe they gamed the Thanksgiving numbers as you said but they certainly skyrocketed prices on everything else recently over here. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 4 points 7 days ago If I were to guess - supply chain is making the turkeys regardless - Walmart probably orders LONG in advance and might aswell eat the cost and maybe get ancillary sales or atleast clear out as opposed to not selling anything. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 11 points 7 days ago MasterChief 1 points 7 days ago this permalink parent award report block reply ImportantPerson 0 points 7 days ago The walmart in my area currently has the cheapest beef, chicken, eggs, most \"fresh\" vegetables, bread and dairy.  The only thing that's significantly more expensive at walmart is soda. Not sure where everyone is seeing that they are jacking their prices up on \"everything\".  My guess is that they are full of shit  especially when they say \"everything\". permalink parent award report block reply UsernameChexOut 2 points 7 days ago We've stopped shopping for food at Walmart, it no longer really makes sense. I think Walmart gets by on the convenience of a one stop shop and the fact that they may be the only game in town in more rural areas. Overall though, the prices seem higher and every time we walk by they seem to get more and more crazy. For us, Trader Joe's, Costco and Kroger are in one area and are an easy stop. Between those, not only do you get better quality food, it also ends up being significantly cheaper. The stuff that we end up shopping for at Walmart are non-food items and there have been multiple price hikes recently to the point that we now only go there for stuff that we need immediately. If I need charcoal, butter, corn and I'll pick up some hot wheels for the kids, then it's Walmart. But the overall prices for all these items individually now make sense to buy from other stores when you're there anyways. permalink parent award report block reply ImportantPerson 2 points 6 days ago Walmart does get by on the convenience of the one stop shop but that only works when there are some prices that will bring people to the stop.  If you go to walmart and buy everything, you are going to be paying more because the higher marked up items are marked up a lot more. Like I said, I can buy eggs, beef and dairy from walmart for cheaper than I can anywhere else in the area but if I want other things, often times junk food like soda and chips, walmart is significantly more expensive.  They know their audience.  Their audience buys junkfood. permalink parent award report block reply DingleBalls 16 points 7 days ago But Biden saved us 16c on hotdogs or some shit for 4th of july! permalink award report block reply FUCK_TYLER 2 points 6 days ago yup, read my mind brother permalink parent award report block reply LordKuroTheGreat 14 points 7 days ago I wonder how that compares percentage-wise to the upward creep that's been going on all fall. permalink award report block reply Ligersrule1 14 points 7 days ago Fuck walmart permalink award report block reply Mountaineer 8 points 7 days ago In the ass with a pineapple.

We know who's fault it is that things are as fucked as they are. But a lot of people are just plain desperate. And that's not good. At all. I like trump and think he's doing a lot of great things policy wise but addressing and correcting the prices for bare necessities, dealing with out of control crime, and restoring faith in open and transparent government (which the East wing demolition and how it was handled did a lot to damage) are far more important than \"owning\" the Dems. We need to own the fuckers on election day. permalink parent award report block reply geekesmind 4 points 7 days ago yeah spending 100+ a week on what looks like NOTHING but people on EBT get to load their carts up FULL with steak, lobster, frozen food, snack cakes, soda and ETC and I am getting things like potatoes, bread, pasta and etc struggling working 50+ hours a week while the freeloaders GET IT ALL! permalink parent award report block reply mikejones 3 points 7 days ago Would rather work 50 hours knowing I'll be okay.

I'm paying $2 a dozen of eggs.  Chicken breasts are $2.42 a pound.  Vegetables like Bell Peppers are $0.67 each. The majority of the items where the prices are high are shitty foods.  Walmart has the highest soda prices.  Cereal is 20% higher than other places.  Chips are 20% higher than other places. So I'm really not sure where you are coming up with your numbers but my guess is that you are pulling them out of your ass. permalink parent award report block reply Mulletgunning 3 points 7 days ago Fuck off faggot.

So I suggest you look up prices at Wal-Mart in South Mississippi at Gulfport stores and you can see for yourself. I shop for myself and my mother at Sams and Wal-Mart two to three times a week. I know those prices like the back of my hand fucklip. So you can be grateful your local Wal-Mart sells them cheaper while I and many others can attest to their prices being high. A fucking jar of mayo is 9 dollars ,a tub of butter is 8 dollars ,beef is outrageous and unless you buy leg quarters for 9 dollars for ten pounds chicken is high too. You are an absolute moron to assume others are lying about grocery prices. Their is no incentive to lie about something like that. Try to prove me wrong faggot. Look them up yourself and Ill be waiting for an apology from you . That's if you are a real man that can admit when you are wrong. But ,I highly doubt you are of that character. You will just continue on in your moronic outbursts even when you are wrong. Get a grip.

But this year has been rough as the prices kept going up as we keep exporting our prime cuts, and importing crap for hamburger (which I also forgot about). Now on to Turkey, Turkey is always cheapest after Thanksgiving for a few months, then climbs back up, ironically this is the only time of the year I try to avoid having to purchase a turkey, now with that said, as far as I can tell, turkey doesn't change much, its cheaper and then more expensive, but overall it hasn't changed much. Also the cost for whole chickens went up too. I smoke a lot of meat with friends and kind of keep a mental tab as the bill keeps going up. permalink award report block reply RocksCanOnlyWait 3 points 7 days ago Data is likely from this article: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkey-price-increase-thanksgiving-2025/ The Farm Bureau data isn't the same items or quantities as store deals, nor does it account for store discounts. That means the 25% number is exaggerated. I found this article from 2024 which said Aldi had a $47 deal for 10 people, and they're offering it at $40 this year. That works out to a 17.5% decrease . permalink award report block reply aqua27 3 points 6 days ago Food prices are still very high and going to the store for a few items is easy 100$ not good for working poor and middle class.

You are fucking subscribing to items and you are shocked then they increase their prices?  You are telling them that you are going to keep buying the item so why wouldn't they increase their prices? There's a reason why companies love subscriptions and it's because of lazy people who won't bother to check the prices. We used to clip coupons and look at the ads for sales on different food.  Now, we have lazy people who buy at whatever price and then complain about how expensive groceries are. My grocery bill per week for my full family has gone down $75 since 2023 and it's because I've put more effort into thrifty purchasing.  Beef was on sale so I bought 12 pounds of it, freezing some.

We must do what happened in the 80s and create massive economic growth to make wages outpace what was lost to inflation. So what must be done to accomplish that? Well that's where we have problems because the Republicans no longer stand for liberty-centric economic policy, but if you did these 4 things, you would almost immediately see the 10% growth rates of the 19th century return: End the federal reserve and put us back on the gold standard to restrict future government spending and slam the brakes on inflation ELIMINATE socialist social welfare programs. That would include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and especially WELFARE. Congrats, you just saved 4.6 trillion a year in federal spending RE-abolish our progressive income tax. With this one, the 50% of Americans that actually pay income taxes after credits and deductions, just got a very significant raise which is what would encourage the economic growth Eliminate 90% of the fascistic regulatory state that was never supposed to exist in the first place and imposes 80,000 pages of regulations on Americans conducting business. That now consists of 2.5 MILLION bureaucrats. That number should be less than 100k when you're done If you do those 4 things, we return to the economy we THRIVED under for well over a century and produced the largest economic explosion in world history. In just 4 years time our GDP would go from 27 trillion to over 40 trillion. That's a 60k raise for every American, assuming it was distributed equally which admittedly wouldn't happen, but it gives you an idea of how much wealth is being lost to socialist bullshit.

We must do what happened in the 80s and create massive economic growth to make wages outpace what was lost to inflation. So what must be done to accomplish that? Well that's where we have problems because the Republicans no longer stand for liberty-centric economic policy, but if you did these 4 things, you would almost immediately see the 10% growth rates of the 19th century return: End the federal reserve and put us back on the gold standard to restrict future government spending and slam the brakes on inflation ELIMINATE socialist social welfare programs. That would include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and especially WELFARE. Congrats, you just saved 4.6 trillion a year in federal spending RE-abolish our progressive income tax. With this one, the 50% of Americans that actually pay income taxes after credits and deductions, just got a very significant raise which is what would encourage the economic growth Eliminate 90% of the fascistic regulatory state that was never supposed to exist in the first place and imposes 80,000 pages of regulations on Americans conducting business. That now consists of 2.5 MILLION bureaucrats. That number should be less than 100k when you're done If you do those 4 things, we return to the economy we THRIVED under for well over a century and produced the largest economic explosion in world history. In just 4 years time our GDP would go from 27 trillion to over 40 trillion. That's a 60k raise for every American, assuming it was distributed equally which admittedly wouldn't happen, but it gives you an idea of how much wealth is being lost to socialist bullshit. And all we need to do is return to our liberty-centric economic roots. permalink parent award report block reply DatTrumpDoh 7 points 7 days ago That second bullet is DOA.

EBT increases grocery prices just as federal government loans increase the price of higher education.

I think Walmart gets by on the convenience of a one stop shop and the fact that they may be the only game in town in more rural areas. Overall though, the prices seem higher and every time we walk by they seem to get more and more crazy. For us, Trader Joe's, Costco and Kroger are in one area and are an easy stop. Between those, not only do you get better quality food, it also ends up being significantly cheaper. The stuff that we end up shopping for at Walmart are non-food items and there have been multiple price hikes recently to the point that we now only go there for stuff that we need immediately. If I need charcoal, butter, corn and I'll pick up some hot wheels for the kids, then it's Walmart. But the overall prices for all these items individually now make sense to buy from other stores when you're there anyways. permalink parent award report block reply ImportantPerson 2 points 6 days ago Walmart does get by on the convenience of the one stop shop but that only works when there are some prices that will bring people to the stop.  If you go to walmart and buy everything, you are going to be paying more because the higher marked up items are marked up a lot more. Like I said, I can buy eggs, beef and dairy from walmart for cheaper than I can anywhere else in the area but if I want other things, often times junk food like soda and chips, walmart is significantly more expensive.

Look them up yourself and Ill be waiting for an apology from you . That's if you are a real man that can admit when you are wrong. But ,I highly doubt you are of that character. You will just continue on in your moronic outbursts even when you are wrong. Get a grip. Enjoy your cheerleading for the lies being told by Wal-Mart and the fucking shit Israel First advisors surrounding GEOTUS.

The RNC is worthless. Trump is going to have to force them to take action. Meanwhile, he's struggling to get the Jews and Mooselems to play nice and has failed at solving the Urine conflict. I'm not blaming Trump for his efforts. I just wish he'd focus on domestic issues from now on. permalink award report block reply mikejones 3 points 7 days ago Probably harder to focus on domestic issues when he's fighting the uniparty that will stall him. permalink parent award report block reply\nmikejones 3 points 7 days ago Probably harder to focus on domestic issues when he's fighting the uniparty that will stall him. permalink parent award report block reply\njdemarco2014 5 points 7 days ago If anything my grocery bill has been going up alot more lately permalink award report block reply\nSavingPrivateGrace 5 points 7 days ago No thanks, and why advertise for Walmart.

Then by the Biden years it became once every week or two, just forgot what flank steak was, but brisket was still affordable...for a time. But this year has been rough as the prices kept going up as we keep exporting our prime cuts, and importing crap for hamburger (which I also forgot about). Now on to Turkey, Turkey is always cheapest after Thanksgiving for a few months, then climbs back up, ironically this is the only time of the year I try to avoid having to purchase a turkey, now with that said, as far as I can tell, turkey doesn't change much, its cheaper and then more expensive, but overall it hasn't changed much. Also the cost for whole chickens went up too. I smoke a lot of meat with friends and kind of keep a mental tab as the bill keeps going up. permalink award report block reply\nRocksCanOnlyWait 3 points 7 days ago Data is likely from this article: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkey-price-increase-thanksgiving-2025/ The Farm Bureau data isn't the same items or quantities as store deals, nor does it account for store discounts. That means the 25% number is exaggerated. I found this article from 2024 which said Aldi had a $47 deal for 10 people, and they're offering it at $40 this year. That works out to a 17.5% decrease . permalink award report block reply\naqua27 3 points 6 days ago Food prices are still very high and going to the store for a few items is easy 100$ not good for working poor and middle class.
