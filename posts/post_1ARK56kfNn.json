We imported the Third World. There is a reason they were Third World. permalink award report block reply BenDoverAssho 7 points 4 days ago The problem is that Communist Democrats have a very different culture and set of values than America First Constitutionalists/MAGA. Now that the Democrats have formed a, \" Communist-\nIslamist Coalition,  they are ACTIVELY facilitating the importation of goatfucking Middle Eastern street shitters. permalink award report block reply Govtizbad OP 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply ModernKnight 6 points 4 days ago There is a bit of nuance here.  You CAN take in a VERY LIMITED number of high-achieving people from other cultures.  However, the numbers HAVE to be very small- as in there should never be less than 98% of the local culture, and those you bring in CAN NOT be put in close proximity to others of their culture.  It has to be set up so that following their own culture makes them completely alone in their practices.  It makes it so they MUST integrate in order to have any kind of community. permalink award report block reply BenDoverAssho 2 points 4 days ago This! permalink parent award report block reply Hoodlum 2 points 4 days ago It's not worth the effort to sift through shit to find a golden nugget.

And start thinning the herd already in the country. Their kind breeds like rabbits, and worse, your taxpayer money probably helps to feed and raise their brats. If you let them be, in one generation the country will be reduced to their level. It's a numbers game, and if you can't outbreeed them, deport or cull them.
