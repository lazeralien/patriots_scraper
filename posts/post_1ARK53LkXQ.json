Antifa's hometurf was always Germany, the amount of its sub-organisation in its network here is mind boggling. There are even members in the parliaments, e.g. the German Minister of Finance, and all over the media (although another leftist faction, the Greens, are slightly more dominant there). That's why I don't think AntiFA will be declared an international terrorist organization in the US (and if it happens, it'll be a completely useless definition of who is part of AntiFA, that hardly applies to anyone). But it'd be hilarious and absolutely necessary. Like locking a Minister of Finance out of access to financial institutions, or dropping sanctions on about half a million Germans all at once, either for spreading leftist violence around the globe directly or the NGO- or donor-laundered tax payer money that funds it. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 3 points 5 days ago First USAID sends money to THOSE SAME NGO's - for the same reasons, attack Nationalism and Patriotism in Europe. Second...  and it is complex... but Trump already made the call. On September 22, 2025, Trump signed an Executive Order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, directing federal agencies to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle its operations and funding sources. Domestic Terrorism is limited in the US.  so - - In October 2025 , Trump expressed intent to escalate this effort by considering Antifa for designation as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) , stating during a White House roundtable, \u201cLet\u2019s get it done\u201d. FTO designation would carry significant legal consequences , including criminalizing material support to Antifa with penalties of at least 20 years in prison, enabling asset freezes through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and allowing surveillance and deportation of non-citizens linked to the group.
