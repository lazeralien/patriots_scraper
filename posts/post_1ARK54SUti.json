Officials say this represents an arrest rate of 258 illegal aliens per day \u2014 less than 11 per hour. During the Biden administration, agents were overwhelmed with an average apprehension rate of more than 5,100 per day. One year ago, agents apprehended more than 300 illegal aliens every four hours. permalink award report block reply bigdickhangsright 18 points 5 days ago It's... almost... as if border control works for sovereign countries and the Democrats intentionally tried to destroy our nation. permalink award report block reply Oleander 8 points 5 days ago They succeeded in doing so. Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better, far too many were already let in. That's not to mention border security is now a political issue instead of bipartisan, so Democrats will do their best to reverse all security once they get back in, possibly even do mass amnesty. permalink parent award report block reply TEXinLA OP 1 points 3 days ago WEIRD HUH? permalink parent award report block reply RandyMoss 9 points 5 days ago I'm at the DMV right now.

You know what was optics? When Obama changed the definition of \u201cdeported\u201d to include those simply turned away at the border, so they could inflate their deportation statistics permalink parent award report block reply RandyMoss 1 points 5 days ago That isn't really saying anything, sadly. In defense of Trump it may take time to build the systems and infrastructure to accommodate the numbers that need deporting.  That's an optimistic view.\nA pessimistic view (doomer if you insist) recognizes that branding and noise are what Trump specializes in. Results? A lot less. Is it his fault? Ultimately yes because he keeps trying to work with the traitor RINOs instead of demanding they work with him or get the boot. Trump has really lost me when he picks fights with Massie and Paul on legislation that was WRITTEN BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION!!!  How do you reconcile that? permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 1 points 5 days ago Literally no other GOP politician even had the political will to touch the idea of a border wall or deportations with a ten foot pole, much less actually get those efforts underway. Once again, your claim of \u201cno results\u201d is provably false. Speaking in sweeping absolutes just makes you look like a concern troll shill. permalink parent award report block reply RandyMoss 2 points 4 days ago Fair point on the border wall.

Start with the illegals using the greatest amount of taxpayer money. There's illegals in the CA health care system that suck up several million dollars a year. permalink parent award report block reply JoePlumber 3 points 3 days ago I'm tired of the \"start with these\" argument that's how we wound up here, 10 months in with only 600k deported. We need to crank it up across the board. Every single workplace should be investigated and raided. Every single illegal needs to be round up and shipped back. The deportation strategy needs to change too..no more 3 ICE agents wrestling one Mexican into handcuffs for 15 minutes. Spot an illegal, taze the fuck out of them, put a bag over their head and drive them immediately to the closest air force base where a c-130 is waiting. Fill the c-130. They wait there with the bags on their heads until the c-130 is filled then it immediately takes off and they're deported. Rinse and repeat. No housing, no beds, no food or water just straight from arrest to the plane to some shit hole country. That's the way it should be going. permalink parent award report block reply TEXinLA OP 1 points 3 days ago Agreed... Way Too Many RINOs are stopping this.. permalink parent award report block reply NoMoreShinesBilly 1 points 5 days ago if the gov says it's 10 million invaders under tater, it's 25 million at a minimum. permalink parent award report block reply OnlyTrump20 2 points 5 days ago The best deterrent is to end free handouts to foreigners who want to take our money.   Once they realize just how expensive it is to live in the US they'll see their home countries as the better place.   The illegal Mexicans in the US already consider Mexico better as they keep waving their flag around.  Why bother with the US at all. permalink award report block reply TEXinLA OP 1 points 3 days ago Agreed.

Start with the illegals using the greatest amount of taxpayer money. There's illegals in the CA health care system that suck up several million dollars a year. permalink parent award report block reply JoePlumber 3 points 3 days ago I'm tired of the \"start with these\" argument that's how we wound up here, 10 months in with only 600k deported. We need to crank it up across the board. Every single workplace should be investigated and raided. Every single illegal needs to be round up and shipped back. The deportation strategy needs to change too..no more 3 ICE agents wrestling one Mexican into handcuffs for 15 minutes. Spot an illegal, taze the fuck out of them, put a bag over their head and drive them immediately to the closest air force base where a c-130 is waiting. Fill the c-130. They wait there with the bags on their heads until the c-130 is filled then it immediately takes off and they're deported. Rinse and repeat. No housing, no beds, no food or water just straight from arrest to the plane to some shit hole country. That's the way it should be going. permalink parent award report block reply TEXinLA OP 1 points 3 days ago Agreed... Way Too Many RINOs are stopping this.. permalink parent award report block reply\nJoePlumber 3 points 3 days ago I'm tired of the \"start with these\" argument that's how we wound up here, 10 months in with only 600k deported.

Once they realize just how expensive it is to live in the US they'll see their home countries as the better place.   The illegal Mexicans in the US already consider Mexico better as they keep waving their flag around.  Why bother with the US at all. permalink award report block reply TEXinLA OP 1 points 3 days ago Agreed. Immediate deportation, lifetime tab kept for deportation costs and any government services used. permalink parent award report block reply\nTEXinLA OP 1 points 3 days ago Agreed.
