In the exchange, Ingraham pressed Trump on whether restricting H-1B visas would be a priority for his administration to avoid flooding the job market with foreign workers and suppressing American wages. Trump replied, "I agree — but you also do have to bring in talent," before elaborating that the U.S. lacks "certain talents" domestically. When Ingraham countered, "We have plenty of talented people here," Trump responded: "No, you don’t, no you don’t … you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory where we’re going to make missiles.’" He cited a September 2025 ICE raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia—where South Korean workers with specialized skills were deported—as an example of why such immigrants are sometimes necessary. permalink award report block reply bidensmissingbrain -1 points 3 hours ago Ragebait media gonna ragebait. permalink parent award report block reply notsuicidalatall 0 points 3 hours ago right, him commenting isn't an advertisement of his 'policy', he's playing on a playing field with multiple 'teams' and 'fans'.
