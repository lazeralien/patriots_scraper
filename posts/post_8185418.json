They'd shift like a chameleon to whatever form seems politically convenient. permalink parent award report block reply\nClassygasoline 7 points 7 hours ago Does the state of California get punished at all for issuing those licenses? Do the families that lost loved ones to those \"licensed\" truckers get to sue California? Something needs to be done or this shit will continue until the country is gone permalink award report block reply\nAquamine-Amarine 6 points 7 hours ago Those are really stupid nicknames. permalink award report block reply Parhelion12 5 points 7 hours ago The left can't meme. permalink parent award report block reply\nParhelion12 5 points 7 hours ago The left can't meme. permalink parent award report block reply\nJBlaze056 5 points 7 hours ago How about punish them for their behavior right now and not after they do something else. permalink award report block reply\nReleasetheList 4 points 6 hours ago How about some prison time for those responsible? Oh, I know that's way to much to ask. permalink award report block reply\nFormerlurker92 3 points 5 hours ago Just pull it. You're gonna need time to fight the district court judges permalink award report block reply\nInfinitesimalOrange 2 points 2 hours ago Who is getting punished for illegally issuing seventeen thousand trucking licenses? Anybody? Anyone? Someone? Something? No? The punishment is to not receive 160 million dollars? I'm absolutely certain if I myself issued 17,000 illegal licenses I would be going to jail forever. permalink award report block reply\nKlaus73 2 points 5 hours ago Sounds like a breakdown between States. permalink award report block reply\nitspancakees 2 points 5 hours ago Just pull the funding now, why wait?! permalink award report block reply\nSaltyTitties4 2 points 2 hours ago HOW ABOUT YOU ARREST EVERY PERSON WHO ISSUED THOSE ILLEGAL LICENSES??? if that isn\u2019t done, this is just a stupid fake show as usual to make us think something good is happening.  And I\u2019ll bet money that not one person will be fired. permalink award report block reply\nSavingPrivateGrace 2 points 7 hours ago The commies sure had a good time problem solving what to do with their new imported voters driving their elections. permalink award report block reply\nthisisatestof2 2 points 7 hours ago Can we just revoke their federal funding anyway? permalink award report block reply\nNoMoreShinesBilly 2 points 6 hours ago pull the funding first.  agree to reinstate later once the illegality is \"resolved.\" permalink award report block reply\nAmannamedRJ 2 points 2 hours ago Only 160 million? Come on now. Pull ALL federal funding from CA. The CDL thing and lying about it need to be punished severely. California will not revoke its CDLs in a timely manner. permalink award report block reply\nActNow 2 points 7 hours ago 17K!?! I thought the roads were getting crazy. Thank you, Secretary Duffy. permalink award report block reply\nschiff_for_brains 2 points 7 hours ago The damage has already been done.  There are official plastic cards saying No Name Given is qualified to drive massive trucks on the road. permalink award report block reply\nSnooptwo 2 points 2 hours ago How about pull the funds first and give them back when they comply. permalink award report block reply\nscrubking 2 points 6 hours ago Another day, another empty Republican threat. permalink award report block reply\nTruth_Cipher 1 points 6 hours ago Just pull all funding and let things sort themselves out. Remove sanctuary states ability to issue CDLs and really anything past an ID card. That will force policy change. permalink award report block reply\n67Vert 1 points 6 hours ago $160M doesn\u2019t seem like much in this context. permalink award report block reply\ncontender 1 points 4 hours ago and 17,000 new voters the DMV test terminal registers you to vote permalink award report block reply\nMorokei 1 points 7 hours ago At least Duffy has a concrete plan to actually do something. Instead of sending a memo to Congress like Blondie. permalink award report block reply\nBluemoonsugar 1 points 4 minutes ago Don't say, just do it! This would be called bad parenting when a child does something wrong and has no consequences for their action and you just threaten and do nothing. permalink award report block reply\nDagneyTaggart 1 points 2 hours ago and Pam's going to put lawbreakers in jail, right? RIGHT? RIGHT? RIGHT? permalink award report block reply\ngaijin_ronin 1 points 5 hours ago Lawsuits probably already filed against this. permalink award report block reply\nmidgetpornrocks 1 points 4 hours ago Why can't we have both? permalink award report block reply\nStormeyworld13 1 points 3 hours ago Why can't we just arrest Gavin Newscum?! Really. Remove him from office. He stole his election. We recalled that evil bastard and he cheated to stay. Send him off to GITMO now! permalink award report block reply\nNoWorries77 1 points 4 hours ago Enough talk. Pull the doggon money. permalink award report block reply\nlifeisahologram 1 points 4 hours ago How about we start DOING things first, as a consequence for what they already did, then they will have incentive to stop and comply so we stop? permalink award report block reply\nGoatboy66 1 points 6 hours ago Non-Citizens can be here Legally. It doesn't Mean Illegal Aliens. permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 5 hours ago It's a word game. Resident aliens would have been called just that. permalink parent award report block reply\nMichalusmichalus 1 points 5 hours ago It's a word game.

Awesome. permalink award report block reply\nTookens 1 points 4 hours ago That's nice but $160 million compared to CA's annual budget is nothing. permalink award report block reply\nIPMang 1 points 3 hours ago Notice how when the government does something illegal, nobody gets sued or goes to jail or has literally anything bad happen? Weird. permalink award report block reply\nyodayoda 1 points 3 hours ago California won't give a crap about 160mil. permalink award report block reply\nCrankyCrab 1 points 7 hours ago 17,000 illegal CDLs issued by Commiefornia!!!  That alone more than justifies pulling the funding! permalink award report block reply\nNonbinaryPotatohead 1 points 6 hours ago Do it and then talk about it for once permalink award report block reply\nbananafone 1 points 1 hour ago Just based off the simple fact that these people need somebody on a cell phone giving them the answers  while they're doing their CDL is more than enough to shut down the whole system. permalink award report block reply\nYodaBannon 1 points 7 hours ago that\u2019s it! I\u2019m gettin grandma! permalink award report block reply\nslimcoat 1 points 4 hours ago No \"or\". Pull the funds NOW and reinstate them once they cooperate fully. permalink award report block reply\nedxzxz 1 points 4 hours ago Here's a crazy idea - instead of demanding they stop doing illegal shit or else you'll punish them, punish them for doing the illegal shit, and then they'll stop.  Because everyone knows if you actually intended to punish them, they'd already have been punished. permalink award report block reply\niamherefortheluls 0 points 7 hours ago good, keep pressing forward permalink award report block reply",
