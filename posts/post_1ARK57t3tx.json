First thing any country has to do is food. Grow it, trade for it, whatever you gotta do, but soon, you need to be producing your own food. Let me ask AI how they're doing: \"Venezuelan agriculture has significantly declined over the years, contributing only about 3% to the country's GDP and employing around 10% of the labor force. The sector faces challenges such as government intervention, food shortages, and reliance on food imports, primarily from Colombia and the United States.\" Wait, the USA is trading them food? permalink award report block reply JoeBidensDementia1 2 points 4 days ago The Muslims will also start fucking goats on the street corners. permalink award report block reply DudeNoOne 1 points 4 days ago I think they can learn this lesson the hard way permalink award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 4 days ago 1992 - Aside from the U.S., Venezuela had the highest GDP (by the old calculation) than any country south of the border and higher than Canada. Then they voted in the socialist Hugo Chavez. They they started making deals with China for rice.\nThen the government outlawed guns.\nThen the government enacted universal health care.\nThen the government kicked U.S. oil companies out.\nThen the pumps on their oil wells started failing and no one knew how to get them to work.\nThen the rice deal didn't deliver any rice.\nThen the people had no food, no medicine and no doctors and no nurses, except those who were dumb enough to stay to try and help people while being robbed and having their equipment stolen.\nThen they started eating pets.\nThen they started eating zoo animals.\nThen they started eating rodents. The commies in charge are still fat though. permalink award report block reply whataboob 1 points 4 days ago I\u2019m no defender of socialism, but did that happen because of socialism or because of US sanctions against Venezuela? \u2026 permalink award report block reply Cubey 1 points 3 days ago So in order to be a successful socialist country they need to rely on trade with the USA? permalink parent award report block reply whataboob 1 points 3 days ago Haha Ever wonder why we don\u2019t sanction China, the biggest communist state on earth? \u2026. Ever wonder why we expect Russia to be cutoff from the entire planet due to our sanctions? \u2026 US sanctions aren\u2019t some US trade embargo by the United States of America, or a just a simple refusal to trade with a country, as you seem to be implying. US sanctions are a threat to the entire planet, to any country who is still scared of this pathetic dying faggot US warmonger empire (and the list is quickly shrinking), that they will face US punishment of various kinds if they do business with a sanctioned country. If that\u2019s new to you, it\u2019s understandable.  They don\u2019t advertise it that way, as being a faggot scum empire bullying the world to crush countries we disagree with.   \u201cWe\u2019re the good guys\u201d doing it for democracy, or some other trash reason that\u2019s supposed to make me okay with them crushing countries in my name for their crony capitalist goals. And it should also help color why they\u2019re so hellbent about their gayass Russia sanctions lol cuz it ain\u2019t working because too many countries think we\u2019re a dying weak pathetic desperate empire and continue to do business with Russia. Wahhh Trump is upset lol just like Biden. (Unless it\u2019s 5D chess and he has to act like a Bidenesque faggot for the Lindsey Grahams of the world who have a knife to his back? \u2026 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ) Meanwhile, they suck CCP China\u2019s dick daily.  I mean, I\u2019m not against doing business with China, but they sold most of our country\u2019s production to the biggest communist state on earth, meanwhile they pretend they have a problem with socialism? They\u2019re lying pathetic faggots, and they\u2019re just trying to rob Venezuela cuz they failed miserably to rob Russia.  And it\u2019s not clear they\u2019ll succeed even in Venezuela, cuz today\u2019s faggot scum just isn\u2019t as competent  as their predecessor ancestor scum. permalink parent award report block reply Megaboom2025 1 points 4 days ago I am legend takes place in New York City only permalink award report block reply Toohershat 1 points 4 days ago It's a simple death sentence for a nation, but the NY thing is a different type of animal. Same socialist scam, but here it's a major city in a non-socialist country. What I'm saying is that it will fuck up NYC, but those of us Americans outside of that city will be put under pressure to bail them out. The media will come to their aid, saying Trump did this, MAGA did that, etc. They won't be eating zoo animals anytime soon, trust me. permalink award report block reply Tobin 1 points 4 days ago Is that what the Venezuelan temporary resident people were fleeing?
