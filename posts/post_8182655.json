I imagine he's pushing his DOJ hard on it.

I'm of the opinion that Bondi and Kash aren't doing a damn thing and he's being misled that something's going to happen or Trump doesn't actually care and is using it to bait us like he did with \"Hillary 4 Prison\" that never even began when he got into office. permalink parent award report block reply airborne3502 0 points 1 day ago He cares. President Trump has everything to lose if they don't do their jobs. At her confirmation hearing, Bondi wanted to talk about what she saw in Pennsylvania, during the stolen election, so it's something on her radar. Nobody would let her. The deep state isn't going to let up on Trump, or his family, unless he wins this fight. That bullet hit his ear, not mine. Like he said, he's standing in the way between them and us. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 -2 points 1 day ago Trump has nothing to lose; dudes made billions in family fortune since he took office. He isn't running a 3rd term. He's pushing 80. Bondi was likely part of a deal; She likely was planted as a leash on Trump to make sure he doesn't go after the folks that actually tried to kill him. Shes an insurance policy; Trump will be permitted to live and get rich. Kash is a clown so Trump was allowed to put him there as he was a mediocre performer before he became director. Notice how anyone of significance is not being looked into? The folks that were on the Epstien list are probably the same folk undermining Trump and likely the same folks that paid to try and have him killed in Butler. After they came close he was probably told the next time will be a \"heart attack\" or something similar. permalink parent award report block reply spezisacuckold -1 points 1 day ago Trump's happy with Bondi because he probably has a thing for her permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 9 points 1 day ago It is very difficult to keep tabs on ALL THE CRIMES COMMITTED IN DC... by Bureaucrats. So here is the latest on the Congressional investigation into the Biden Autopen: Oversight Committee Releases Report on the Biden Autopen Presidency. Published: Oct 28, 2025. https://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-releases-report-on-the-biden-autopen-presidency/ permalink parent award report block reply bill_in_texas 6 points 1 day ago A congressional oversight report and a buck fifty, plus tax, can get you a senior small coffee at McDonald's, if you're over 55 years old. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 4 points 1 day ago The entire shooting match is based on whether or not BIDEN MADE THE PARDONS.... and how you can prove in court that HE DID NOT. I really don't know the answer to that.  The Founders wanted the President to have ultimate power to issue a Pardon... I suppose the Supremes are 'again' going to have to re-interpret what that means - as the Democrats ABUSED THE LANGUAGE AND THE PROCESS YET AGAIN. permalink parent award report block reply bill_in_texas 1 points 1 day ago All that has to be done is to get Brandon in a deposition when he's having a good day. President Biden, did you order the pardons of all these people [shows him the list]. Brandon:  Yes, I sure did, every one. Thank you, President Biden. Your honor, we're asking for immediate dismissal of this obviously partisan case on the grounds that there is no case, President Biden just told you he ordered each and every pardon. Judge:  Case dismissed, pardons upheld. Anyone who sees this going in a different direction, let me know.  No court, even the SC, is going to rule that Brandon was incapacitated enough to not be able to do official functions like pardons while he was in office.  They just won't want to go there, because of the hornet's nest it would kick over. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

The autopen pardon is in a binary state, with a Rubicon in between. Unless and until anyone thinks Trump is ready to tell the courts to go fuck themselves, there will be no movement on Autopen pardons. There is no form and substance requirement to a pardon in the Constitution. It would be completely uncharted territory to declare an autopen pardon void. A move of pure power. There are dozens of other issues where Trump's authority to act is far clearer, and he's still letting the court process play out. permalink parent award report block reply Trumpwon306 18 points 1 day ago Can't wait for nothing to be done about bombshell #704892734123497 permalink award report block reply SavingPrivateGrace 8 points 1 day ago Corn Pop was a bad dude and so were his gangsters.  The list of pardons cross matches the list of auto-pen abusers. permalink award report block reply bill_in_texas 9 points 1 day ago In actuality, Corn Pop was the hero of the story, the leader of the neighborhood watch that protected the neighborhood kids from pedos that like to have kids rub the hair on their legs, sit in their laps, sniff them, take inappropriate showers with, and much, much worse. permalink parent award report block reply StoopidAsshole69 3 points 1 day ago There was something about Joe that didn\u2019t sit well with Corn Pop. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 3 points 1 day ago Hairy legs.... one pardon for each hair!! permalink parent award report block reply Flataxandmaga 2 points 1 day ago pardoned a lot of leg rubbers. permalink parent award report block reply Redditcensorsyouandi 6 points 1 day ago Biden taking notes is one of the most ludicrous images my brain can conjure this morning.

The deep state is free to do whatever they want. permalink parent award report block reply PhoneBandit 1 points 22 hours ago We could sticky articles of reporters continuously asking the Trump admin for the Epstein list or why we haven't arrested the people conspiring against Trump. permalink parent award report block reply IvIA6A 4 points 1 day ago If Biden is going to be going around still doing speeches and screaming about democracy, he needs to be held accountable, but the doj is never going to prosecute. permalink award report block reply spezisacuckold 1 points 1 day ago He needs to be held accountable regardless of what he does or doesn't do out of office. permalink parent award report block reply IvIA6A 2 points 1 day ago They've already signalled they're not going to touch him because he's old and demented. permalink parent award report block reply Steve56775 1 points 1 day ago Bondi! permalink parent award report block reply current_horror 4 points 1 day ago I always wondered why they were constantly referring to \u201cmemos\u201d in every investigation. Turns it they were just normalizing the idea that no memo = didn\u2019t happen. Because then they can do whatever they want and claim it didn\u2019t happen because\u2026 they didn\u2019t write it down. That\u2019s how dumb they think we are. permalink award report block reply Tulkas71 4 points 1 day ago I doubt he was involved in the Afgan pull out either permalink award report block reply Throwingway22 3 points 1 day ago The autopen pardon is in a binary state, with a Rubicon in between.

The bombshell would be the Supreme Court declaring them void unless evidence can be presented proving them valid. They are THE authority to make this call, but like their abdication of adjudication of the 2020 TX versus PA case, they are shameful cowards other than Alito and Thomas so you can expect them to be silent. permalink award report block reply 2025WhatIsTrue 2 points 1 day ago Likely it was staff members who sold/\"awarded\" the pardons.

You can have your atty sign your documents if you have it in writing. Joe seems to have had nothing to do with the pardons. permalink award report block reply SBOJ_JOBS 1 points 1 day ago I was told Joe kept notes on the tops of his mid-meeting pudding cups, but they went into the trash can with his empties. permalink award report block reply BigCovfefe 0 points 1 day ago Expected this to be another dumb gateway pundit link.

I'm of the opinion that Bondi and Kash aren't doing a damn thing and he's being misled that something's going to happen or Trump doesn't actually care and is using it to bait us like he did with \"Hillary 4 Prison\" that never even began when he got into office. permalink parent award report block reply airborne3502 0 points 1 day ago He cares. President Trump has everything to lose if they don't do their jobs. At her confirmation hearing, Bondi wanted to talk about what she saw in Pennsylvania, during the stolen election, so it's something on her radar. Nobody would let her. The deep state isn't going to let up on Trump, or his family, unless he wins this fight. That bullet hit his ear, not mine. Like he said, he's standing in the way between them and us. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 -2 points 1 day ago Trump has nothing to lose; dudes made billions in family fortune since he took office. He isn't running a 3rd term. He's pushing 80. Bondi was likely part of a deal; She likely was planted as a leash on Trump to make sure he doesn't go after the folks that actually tried to kill him. Shes an insurance policy; Trump will be permitted to live and get rich. Kash is a clown so Trump was allowed to put him there as he was a mediocre performer before he became director. Notice how anyone of significance is not being looked into? The folks that were on the Epstien list are probably the same folk undermining Trump and likely the same folks that paid to try and have him killed in Butler. After they came close he was probably told the next time will be a \"heart attack\" or something similar. permalink parent award report block reply\nairborne3502 0 points 1 day ago He cares.

So here is the latest on the Congressional investigation into the Biden Autopen: Oversight Committee Releases Report on the Biden Autopen Presidency.

I really don't know the answer to that.  The Founders wanted the President to have ultimate power to issue a Pardon... I suppose the Supremes are 'again' going to have to re-interpret what that means - as the Democrats ABUSED THE LANGUAGE AND THE PROCESS YET AGAIN. permalink parent award report block reply bill_in_texas 1 points 1 day ago All that has to be done is to get Brandon in a deposition when he's having a good day. President Biden, did you order the pardons of all these people [shows him the list]. Brandon:  Yes, I sure did, every one. Thank you, President Biden. Your honor, we're asking for immediate dismissal of this obviously partisan case on the grounds that there is no case, President Biden just told you he ordered each and every pardon. Judge:  Case dismissed, pardons upheld. Anyone who sees this going in a different direction, let me know.  No court, even the SC, is going to rule that Brandon was incapacitated enough to not be able to do official functions like pardons while he was in office.  They just won't want to go there, because of the hornet's nest it would kick over. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

The autopen pardon is in a binary state, with a Rubicon in between. Unless and until anyone thinks Trump is ready to tell the courts to go fuck themselves, there will be no movement on Autopen pardons. There is no form and substance requirement to a pardon in the Constitution. It would be completely uncharted territory to declare an autopen pardon void. A move of pure power.
