All electrons are like little planets. They do spin as they sit about an atom. This creates a little tornado in space we call a magnetic field. If all the electrons in a material point their tornado randomly then they cancel each other out. If they point in the same direction they can create a strong wind. That's what allows magnets to reach out and touch things. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 13 points 5 hours ago Akkkkkkkchuly While the planetary analogy for electrons is pedagogically charming, it fundamentally misrepresents quantum electrodynamics and the origin of magnetism.

Neither of these places killed anyone, but Auschwitz did have more amenities. permalink parent award report block reply ianpatrick1966 12 points 5 hours ago Olympic swimming pool, theatre, and one of the most stocked maternity wards in post ww2 Germany. Sounds like heaven permalink parent award report block reply AgnosticTemplar 5 points 3 hours ago Yeah, but they were made to do menial labor, so it was hell for them. permalink parent award report block reply Glory-Unto-God 2 points 2 hours ago Captures a Rothschild. Forces him to clean a mansion. A living hell for him on par with the worst of torture imaginable. permalink parent award report block reply Redpilled2Depression 2 points 3 hours ago They even had a rabbit breeding program permalink parent award report block reply Moose_Antlers 1 points 54 minutes ago Heaven and Auschwitz should never be correlated. That's just a flat-out lie and anyone who has been to the site knows it. No, it wasn't the \"death camp\" we were taught it was. It was an internment camp for the least desirable among German society. They hired guards who were party zealots who eagerly mistreated the prisoners regularly. When it happened, it was permitted, excused, and covered up. Like every other prison in Occupied Europe at the time, they starved because the Wehrmacht was sending everything to the soldiers, who ate first. The prisoners were last to get rations and got the poorest quality treatment of everything. The prisoners suffered accordingly. That was true whether the prisoners were homosexuals, Roma, Slav, or just Aryans who didn't submit to the ruling party. All of them worked at gunpoint. All starved equally while the guards ate first. So yes, Auschwitz had some amenities, but it wasn't a 5-star hotel. Let's never make the mistake of that narrative. That's horse manure. If we're going to scream at the communists and Semites for lying about the camps, then it's our job not to lie to ourselves either. We have to tell the truth. They were prisons of a totalitarian Marxist state and they were awful. permalink parent award report block reply TheMostUselessFeeder 6 points 5 hours ago its weird how these people's entire realities hinge upon Orange Man being literally Hitler they can't function if they're not constantly screaming nazi references like, THIS IS TRUMPS REICHSTAG MOMENT OMG!!!!! (BUT FOR REAL THIS TIME, NOT LIKE THE OTHER 75 TIMES I SAID IT) permalink parent award report block reply AgnosticTemplar 6 points 3 hours ago I wish Trump were even half the nazi leftist pretend he is. permalink parent award report block reply RentedMule 17 points 7 hours ago Just curious; is there even a perimeter fence around the place?  Seems to me, if a few happen to escape into the Everglades before they're loaded onto the planes, that the problem would just take care of itself. permalink award report block reply KernalMustard 10 points 6 hours ago Gators climb chainlink fences. permalink parent award report block reply bratt 3 points 5 hours ago Gators climb chainlink fences I wish they did not think of that detail when building the cages inside the tents. permalink parent award report block reply Here_we_go 7 points 7 hours ago Yeah fenced in. Otherwise lefties would \"wonder\" in for pics. permalink parent award report block reply HKgoneWild 4 points 6 hours ago Why not send them to the gang prison in a certain now peaceful central American country? Let them get first hand photos from the inside and let them meet the \"human rights victims\" they preach about? permalink parent award report block reply Monsterouspoop 14 points 5 hours ago Theyre trying desperately to make it look some sort of holocaust. Its pathetic. permalink award report block reply MAGALADON9 12 points 7 hours ago I researched what escape might look like - and it's a hell.  It's not even gators, which there is literally millions of, it's the conditions the steamroom humidity (90%+)  but with scorching sun and curtains of a million flying biting stinging things flying in your mouth and nose; the water ripples with snakes there are 23 varieties of snake in that area; the natural environment is hazardous, you can get caught in old traps, or tangles of vegetation; the constant scraping and bug bites will lead to open sores and rapid infection. The mercury and other toxic water is an impossible sludge at the bottom and in spots will be thigh high soft mud that a normal man would be exhausted by in 100ft - but you have to go 39 miles to Miami. Impossible.  Maybe one of the most disturbing things is how the flora is laid out - it's a hellish labyrinth of nearly identical twists and bends, you'd look up from your shity makeshift raft only to be confused with the sun beaming through trees and reflecting off water. Heatstroke from the 110\u00b0 heat index and dehydration will drain you quickly and a billion diseases and pathogens are all fighting to get inside you. A gator would be mercy. permalink award report block reply KernalMustard 13 points 6 hours ago They could have stayed home and avoided all that. Its a deterrent. Dont come. Dont go to AA. Easy permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 6 points 6 hours ago I read my \"replies\" and scanned ... don't go to AA And was like: \"I know right, I went a few times but too culty I just stopped drinking I don't need AA, some do, that's cool - I just got into \"Darkside philosophy eg. Sith\" and just stopped.\" Then realized you were not talking about that AA. permalink parent award report block reply someguy7738 2 points 6 hours ago The biggest issue is there's basically no fresh water in the everglades. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 5 points 6 hours ago Potable water. Yes you would be right permalink parent award report block reply PatriotSkorzeny 10 points 7 hours ago How many flights have left? That\u2019s 5 or 6 fights. So only 5 or 6 planes have departed the runway airstrip next to AA? permalink award report block reply Here_we_go 9 points 7 hours ago Should be 12,000,000 \"missing\" so far. Fucking bullshit numbers. 1200 Thats how many nyc were getting from texas by buses a day. permalink award report block reply McFatty7 9 points 7 hours ago Do they really think forming a human \"SOS\" is somehow going to save them? lol permalink award report block reply they-see-me-trollin 10 points 6 hours ago except it's not an SOS.  It's more like a 2OS, or a 5o2.  apparently the letter S doesn't translate consistently in \"retarded illegal alien invader\". permalink parent award report block reply LostElf 5 points 6 hours ago No, but maybe SO5 will. permalink parent award report block reply MyNameIsTaxpayer 2 points 5 hours ago Trucking company hires are a no-show permalink parent award report block reply monkadelic 1 points 5 hours ago They know the left are useful idiots they can manipulate.

Too late, you had your chance. permalink award report block reply magamagashii 2 points 5 hours ago If they are lying about 1200 people being murdered last week, which this number will probably increase to 1 million by the end of Trump's term, then three million years later, then six million years after that....well, if they are lying about that you've got to wonder what else they have lied about. Pretty soon it will probably be illegal to even say they were deported. permalink award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 2 points 2 hours ago I guess the alligators got THEIR SNAP benefits........ permalink award report block reply MkultraUSA 2 points 4 hours ago What if we didn't bother to observe it?

All electrons are like little planets. They do spin as they sit about an atom. This creates a little tornado in space we call a magnetic field. If all the electrons in a material point their tornado randomly then they cancel each other out. If they point in the same direction they can create a strong wind. That's what allows magnets to reach out and touch things. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 13 points 5 hours ago Akkkkkkkchuly While the planetary analogy for electrons is pedagogically charming, it fundamentally misrepresents quantum electrodynamics and the origin of magnetism. Electrons are not classical \u201clittle planets\u201d executing mechanical orbits with intrinsic spin like macroscopic tops; rather, spin is an intrinsic angular momentum governed by Dirac\u2019s relativistic quantum mechanics, with no classical analogue. The electron\u2019s magnetic dipole moment arises primarily from this spin (g \u2248 2), not orbital motion, as confirmed by the anomalous Zeeman effect and precision QED calculations matching experiment to 12 decimal places (\u03b1\u207b\u00b9 \u2248 137.035999177). Bulk magnetism emerges from Pauli exclusion and exchange coupling (Heisenberg Hamiltonian: \u0124 = \u2013J \u03a3 S\u1d62\u00b7S\u2c7c), not mere \u201ctornado alignment.\u201d In ferromagnets, below the Curie temperature, spontaneous symmetry breaking aligns unpaired spins via superexchange or itinerant mechanisms (Stoner criterion), yielding macroscopic fields. Random thermal agitation (kT) competes with this order; cancellation in paramagnets reflects entropy, not geometric nulling of classical dipoles. Thus, the \u201ctornado wind\u201d metaphor collapses under scrutiny: magnetic fields are mediated by virtual photon exchange, not mechanical vortices, and the ability of magnets to \u201creach out\u201d is the relativistic consequence of Lorentz-invariant field tensors, not planetary meteorology. The simplicity is illusory; the reality is profoundly quantum.
