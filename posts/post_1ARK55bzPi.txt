Tell me how the Judge is connected to them in a friendly way and won't recuse himself. In a totally random draw, they somehow always get the one Judge they need. permalink parent award report block reply MickHigan2 -4 points 5 days ago WAOOOOWWW!!! THIS IS IT!!!

Boasberg will somehow be 'randomly' assigned the case, sit on them until after the mid-terms, and afterwards quietly dismiss with prejudice. permalink award report block reply snoopy3210 1 points 4 days ago Why are they saying a probe? It was a freakin investigation of the leading candidate for President based on CIA and MI6 fabricated propaganda and entrapment (they called Don Jr so he would meet with the Russian lawyer they were sending.. the MI6 used a long time contact of the Trump family to create that meeting while they were spreading lies about something nefarious between the campaign and Russia). The CIA also sent Carter Page to Russia in the middle of the campaign to create that fake collusion.
