Ain\u2019t gonna happen. Focus on exposing the rot and corruption so maybe we can get honest politicians and then we can get the MAGA agenda. permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 15 points 4 days ago Arrest the corrupt pooliticians. \"but muh optics\" The dems keep getting in wins without having optics. Imagine how much more we could accomplish if we didn't let optics behave like a yoke the Dems shackled to us!!!! permalink parent award report block reply PhilipeNegro 6 points 4 days ago Because Republicans never want to actually govern, only raise money and hold office. permalink parent award report block reply MAGARondonmonson 1 points 4 days ago Every Senator who is fir the Filibuster should be replaced. The Deep Stste UNI PARTY use this rule to do their will and not the will of the people who voted them in. Why can't we get a Balanced Budget Amendment ? Psstt, the Uni Party do not want one. Now the RINOs have an excuse, we do not have 60 votes. LOL. Its a built in excuse why they never have to pass anything they do not really want, they can just blame Dems, and the other side does the same thing when they are in power. Also, both sides when they are the Minority Party, can GET GRAFT by saying deal with us, give us this, this and this or we can't get to 60 votes for you. One last point, they say this was done way back 75-100 years ago in order to create Bipartisanship amongst the parties. Well, it has had just the opposite affect and I can prove that. If there was a 50 vote rule which represents we the people, as it should be, the Dems would be in these back rooms trying to get the best deal they could get, WORKING with the Majority party. The Filibuster is the worst, most evil rule ever put forth, it deprives us the Majority from ever having a say as the Majority. It is complete BS. permalink parent award report block reply AmericanJawa 5 points 4 days ago i want him to take away the filibuster and pass the MAGA agenda.

The kyle seraphin stuff is always bullshit. So nobody will get arrested because it\u2019s not the right person. You have to look at who is pushing it.

Bongino talked about it on his show endlessly. Kash has been in office for over 8 months and this lesbian cia terrorist has still not been perp walked. This means that either the coverup continues, or she is part of a greater investigation that Kash is not willing to yet reveal. In other words, two more weeks... permalink parent award report block reply roadrunner0 10 points 4 days ago Of course they knew it was a CIA operative.. The person used their phone right in front of a camera out of being a useful idiot or deliberately so they could be caught.. When I heard that cell data for the capitol was \"unavailable\" at the time of the incident I knew that they were in coverup mode since D.C. has massive digital spying going on separately by numerous agencies..

Least obvious goalpost shifting. \"grrr Trump doing nothing about pipebomber\" \"noo not like that\" Also, reveal happens prior to action. If we want action, we must motivate and push Trump himself to do something. Don't expect him to know absolutely everything. Go on Truth Social. permalink parent award report block reply bearhugprolapse 5 points 4 days ago if trump needs us to motivate him to move on the pipe bomber then he doesn\u2019t need to be in office. permalink parent award report block reply roadrunner0 1 points 4 days ago Just maybe the President needs us to start making big noise about all the uncovered corruption and treason by parts of our own government to physically show that we as US citizens of the Constitutional Republic are mad as hell and aren't going to take it anymore..

Unless people are perp walked, convicted, and a giant spectacle is made of it on every single news station, it absolutely does not matter. J6 and the ensuing cover up has served its purpose in poisoning the cultural zeitgeist. Unless you do the above, the idiots that believe it was an insurrection will not change their mind, and even then you'll still have idiots that will believe it was an insurrection.

Leftism requires an upward pressure from below - anyone can sit in the big chair and read a script. How you actually fight it is taking out the base, making those who may be willing to act think twice about it, and removing that upward pressure.

What a coincidence: After opening statements, the prosecution's first witness to testify was Shauni Kerkhoff, who was working with the Civil Disturbance Unit of the U.S. Capitol Police during the riot. The crowd was \"angry and violent\" and extended \"as far as I could see,\" she testified. \"They were calling us 'traitors.' \" The prosecution played a recording of Kerkhoff calling for backup over the radio. Kerkhoff described her own voice on the recording as \"panicked.\" Kerkhoff said she recognized Reffitt from that crowd on Jan. 6, and described how he ascended a stairway outside the Capitol building backed by the mob. She testified that Reffitt appeared to be \"leading the crowd up.\" Kerkhoff said officers used pepper balls and multiple cans of \"OC spray\" \u2014 commonly known as pepper spray \u2014 to try to repel Reffitt's advances. Eventually, Kerkhoff testified, Reffitt was hit with enough spray that he turned back and tried to flush out his eyes with a water bottle. Other rioters, however, pushed past the police line, and would breach the building itself. Nestler, the prosecutor, asked Kerkhoff about whether she considered using her firearm, which she had on her during the riot. \"I assumed that people in this crowd were armed,\" Kerkhoff responded, and said she was reluctant to use her own firearm because it could lead to a \"shootout,\" killing multiple people. Kerkhoff did testify that she did not see any indication that Reffitt was armed, though she said she did not have a view of his right hip, where his holster allegedly was. permalink award report block reply hoodar 6 points 4 days ago It's a dyke?

What a coincidence: After opening statements, the prosecution's first witness to testify was Shauni Kerkhoff, who was working with the Civil Disturbance Unit of the U.S. Capitol Police during the riot. The crowd was \"angry and violent\" and extended \"as far as I could see,\" she testified. \"They were calling us 'traitors.' \" The prosecution played a recording of Kerkhoff calling for backup over the radio. Kerkhoff described her own voice on the recording as \"panicked.\" Kerkhoff said she recognized Reffitt from that crowd on Jan. 6, and described how he ascended a stairway outside the Capitol building backed by the mob. She testified that Reffitt appeared to be \"leading the crowd up.\" Kerkhoff said officers used pepper balls and multiple cans of \"OC spray\" \u2014 commonly known as pepper spray \u2014 to try to repel Reffitt's advances. Eventually, Kerkhoff testified, Reffitt was hit with enough spray that he turned back and tried to flush out his eyes with a water bottle. Other rioters, however, pushed past the police line, and would breach the building itself. Nestler, the prosecutor, asked Kerkhoff about whether she considered using her firearm, which she had on her during the riot. \"I assumed that people in this crowd were armed,\" Kerkhoff responded, and said she was reluctant to use her own firearm because it could lead to a \"shootout,\" killing multiple people. Kerkhoff did testify that she did not see any indication that Reffitt was armed, though she said she did not have a view of his right hip, where his holster allegedly was. permalink award report block reply\nhoodar 6 points 4 days ago It's a dyke?
