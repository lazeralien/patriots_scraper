14 First the absurd 50 year mortgage idea, now the FHFA is proposing a “portable mortgage.” Maybe just let the free market that people claim to love work and let the prices of houses correct to their true market rate by getting the speculative investors the hell out?

So, are you proposing government do something to remove an entity that’s apart of “The Free Market”?
Just because some people learn to game the system doesn’t mean it’s wrong, it just means it can be very very unfair to others. Which a market’s goal is to get goods and services to those who are willing to pay “The Price,” no matter how ridiculous the price can be and tilting it will be for others that’s not playing the same game.
You do see the problem in suggesting to get speculative investors out when a free market has no restraints in, right?
My view is, I simply want them to give us more details first before the knee jerk reaction. If anything, that short article didn’t say anything and the video wouldn’t play for me.
If I’m to guess, portable mortgage sounds like they are giving a loan away and it’s transferable depending on the house. I’m not saying it’s good or bad but if people want it, will it not be The Free Market deciding too?
At best, Trump administration is throwing out ideas and seeing what sticks.The youth are the weakest link and they do some help to get on their feet. Let’s give them something to shoot for. permalink award report block reply
