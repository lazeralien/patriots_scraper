73 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Aggrieved03 52 points 6 days ago Midterms will be a blood bath! We were promised accountability and got a trailer park bimbo as AG. permalink award report block reply keeptherepublic1776 16 points 6 days ago Correct. Forget arrests how about lower prices. permalink parent award report block reply Aggrieved03 18 points 6 days ago It's all hand in hand. Arrest everyone in DC screwing us over and a natural balance would return but he won't and that concerns me. permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 5 points 6 days ago Because too many are not going to do anything while the minority insane people will do anything and everything. It really is that simple. Now, unless people form a million man march shouting that they want arrests, they want Congress be held accountable, and not run away when the guard is called in is probably the only way that anything will get done fast otherwise things will just be the same with people whining over it. Not much can be done because of that. That is why it is best to form groups at the local level to implement strategies so that when things go bad by them trying to migrate there will be rulings already established to prevent the locusts from changing things. permalink parent award report block reply Tacitus1963 2 points 6 days ago Why doesn't someone on our side organize a march like this?
The Tards and all their scum are able to organize marches against our country all the time.
The RINOs need to realize most of us do not support them while we support PDJT.
However, we must let him know that keeping Scam Blondi and losing the midterms are not an option for his base. permalink parent award report block reply WhereEaglesDare 3 points 6 days ago A lot of trials coming in January in south Florida https://rumble.com/v71bvlg-mike-davis.html?e9s=src_v1_cbl%2Csrc_v1_ucp_a permalink parent award report block reply Aggrieved03 1 points 6 days ago Trials? permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... LolitaExpressPilot 5 points 6 days ago Just 2 moar weeks, fren! permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 10 points 6 days ago I know people will call you a Doomer, but you're absolutely right. Lots of good things on the economic front, but next to nothing on the justice side. And the latter matters now more than ever. permalink parent award report block reply Tacitus1963 1 points 6 days ago I think Scam Blondi is purposely slow walking everything in the hope that the Demtards will be allowed to steal the midterms.
It's so disappointing that Trump chose her to be AG after Gaetz withdrew his nomination.
The RINOs are slow walking everything too on purpose for the same reason. Thune and Johnson are an absolute disgrace.
Where are we at on redistricting?
That's right. All talk, but no action. permalink parent award report block reply Aggrieved03 2 points 5 days ago Susie Wiles chose her, not Trump. permalink parent award report block reply Tacitus1963 2 points 5 days ago I'm seeing a lot of criticism of Susie Wiles.
I read that Wiles helped torpedo Gaetz.
She's a Bushite who is actively undermining Trump.
He is a very smart man, so I don't get it.
Why doesn't he see how she is manipulating him?
I have read that she controls access to him too. permalink parent award report block reply Aggrieved03 2 points 4 days ago She’s whispering poison in his ears and gatekeeping. permalink parent award report block reply ChyNahAzzWhole1 19 points 6 days ago we could pick a daisy and the left wing commie word smiths would call it extremism. A puppy, a kitten a Lion... NO FUCKING MATTER ITS .... REEEEEEEEEEEEEE FAR RIGHT! permalink award report block reply cereal_killer 7 points 6 days ago I remember these protests. I think the Pepe signaling out of Hong Kong was actually some CIA shit. They were trying to get the right on board for a war with China. permalink parent award report block reply djentropyhardcore -1 points 6 days ago I despise war, but if we're going to do it, China is the only country that makes sense. Well that and "Vatican City" (the home of the Antichrist). permalink parent award report block reply cereal_killer 1 points 6 days ago Why does that make sense? Look: I love America, and I would absolutely hate to see China become ascendant over her. However, China isn't trying to turn our kids gay or block out the sun or flood Western nations with brown people. China didn't force us to give up our manufacturing base. China didn't make us set up the Federal Reserve and repeal the gold standard. China didn't send us to war in the Middle East. China doesn't let black criminals wander American streets. If you are looking for a fight, there are plenty to be had closer to home. permalink parent award report block reply djentropyhardcore -1 points 6 days ago As you can see from my comment, I mentioned the two countries responsible for hurting the United States: China is communist, and uses slave labor to undercut our markets.  They are the biggest existential threat to us as they continue to grow and gain power.  They also fund transgender propaganda here, through spies, the WHO, and the UN, because they have too many men due to their former one child policy, and need American women to sustain their population.  China is also responsible for the mass influx of African illegal immigrants due to their colonization of Africa through the belt and road initiative, so yes, they are responsible for black criminals running through the streets. I addressed the flooding of brown illegal immigrants into our land in my second nation.  The Catholic Church is 100% responsible for the Biden surge, considering it was facilitated by a Catholic with a Catholic speaker of the house and through NGOs that are Catholic, to import 20 million Catholics.  Vatican City is a good place to go to war with, especially because as a Christian Nation, we should focus on the highest percentage of anti-christians and non-christians in our nation, and that's Catholics.  As non-christians, they believe in the pagan belief of "salvation through income redistribution" (they call it 'good works'), and are a domestic threat to our sovereignty. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... wilburh09 3 points 6 days ago That’s why i am sick and tired of these posts.  I don’t give a single shit what a democrat thinks. permalink parent award report block reply TrustyTrumpenTrumpet 18 points 6 days ago likely unaware of its association with far-right extremists I'm tired of these people projecting their desired consensus onto everyone as if reality is just what they decide it to be. permalink award report block reply Megaboom2025 6 points 6 days ago Pretty sure HK was protesting against communist China… permalink parent award report block reply keeman 3 points 6 days ago They were protesting in favor of not being part of communist China anymore (and also again). permalink parent award report block reply DanIsSwell 2 points 6 days ago Yeah, they don’t know what Pepe stands for, and people at a race were chanting “Let’s go Brandon” permalink parent award report block reply tommygigantica 12 points 6 days ago yes it's pam bondi sitting there not doing a damn thing, but it is trumps fault since he refuses to do the right thing ever since his first term! never fired Barr, Wray, Fauci, or threw Hillary in prison as promised. could have come in handy during the stolen election in 2020 with true patriots in those positions. Now he's doing more of the same, hasn't fired bondi, in fact doing the opposite by praising her every chance he gets. this is trumps fault for not doing a damn thing about anything. especially all the voter fraud still going on. he's been in office for almost a year and still no arrests. permalink award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 4 points 6 days ago Honestly, the way Trump defended her after she fumbled on the Epstein stuff told me all I needed to know. permalink parent award report block reply friarfox 8 points 6 days ago That was awesome. permalink award report block reply LWGII 6 points 6 days ago What would you like to see happen?  Please remember these cases would most likely be tried in D.C.  The DOJ can't get a felony indictment or even a misdemeanor conviction in front of a DC jury. permalink award report block reply justinkayz 3 points 5 days ago I'd like to see some J6 type shit happen to them. At least a few no knock raids at 3am. We get NOTHING! permalink parent award report block reply patrioticwinning3 6 points 6 days ago With Patel at FBI, and swamp barbie and blanche at DOJ nothing of substance will happen... permalink award report block reply farquhar 5 points 6 days ago Yes, it is so much easier to believe that foreigners are stupid and don't know what the meme means than to accept that they agree with the meme as it stands. permalink award report block reply SupFrens 5 points 6 days ago To me, Pepe is representation of the little guy. The guy that does not have a voice. They just want to eat some nuggies in peace. permalink award report block reply mediocresombrero 2 points 6 days ago Right permalink parent award report block reply slangin_paint 2 points 6 days ago far-right? permalink parent award report block reply FusionBlack 3 points 6 days ago She has no power to prosecute. Only bimbo Bondi can and won't. permalink award report block reply questionmarks 3 points 6 days ago look up  Changpeng Zhao permalink award report block reply keeman 3 points 6 days ago Step 1 - call person using symbol racist in publication A, referencing publication B for evidence of symbol's racism.  Step 2 - call political symbol racist in publication B, referencing publication A for evidence of symbol being used by known racist.  Then the circle of woke is complete. permalink award report block reply TheDevilMonkey 2 points 6 days ago Nothing ever happens and they always win. The uniparty has a new member... permalink award report block reply GhostOfTheRepublic 2 points 6 days ago Pretty sure that’s why they chose Pepe permalink award report block reply LePEDES 2 points 6 days ago Fuck this popsicle stand permalink award report block reply Kilroy 2 points 6 days ago That's what I don't get, Bondi came out and stated ANYONE  who messes with or impedes ICE in any way will get arrested and charged. That part was excellent.
But, zero follow through on anybody more important than a city employee I know they have the evidence to put most of the problem children in prison for 20 years to life. She either needs to run with it and do what she said she'd do or resign in disgrace and admit she's a loser. permalink award report block reply JanOctSept 2 points 6 days ago Wasn’t Hillary supposed to testify to congress last month about this or something? permalink award report block reply justinkayz 2 points 5 days ago Yeah, but then she said she had other plans that day. permalink parent award report block reply ILoveSilk 2 points 6 days ago Trump spent too much time on Israel and foreign affairs. Pam Bondi and Kash Patel are two bad picks. Trump needs to realize he only has 6 - 9 months left to fulfill his campaign promises. permalink award report block reply JoinTheDiscussion 3 points 6 days ago Problem is you think they were "bad" picks and not for an intended reason.. permalink parent award report block reply ILoveSilk 1 points 5 days ago How do you know what I think or not think? Can't never trust anyone these days. Everyone has a secret, or wants to put their hands into cookie jars. permalink parent award report block reply JoinTheDiscussion 1 points 5 days ago Because you said and I quote "Pam Bondi and Kash Patel are two bad picks" permalink parent award report block reply ILoveSilk 2 points 5 days ago I don't think Trump picked them because he expected them not doing right thing. People who recommended them may and will and probably have. Anyway, Trump doesn't have much time. The establishment just play games with him. MAGA is still vulnerable. permalink parent award report block reply Ryunnsun 2 points 6 days ago Government shutdown happened. Why else would the democrats poison pill appropriations? They love spending money. permalink award report block reply conservative01 1 points 6 days ago Nothing will happen period except the status quo.

The Catholic Church is 100% responsible for the Biden surge, considering it was facilitated by a Catholic with a Catholic speaker of the house and through NGOs that are Catholic, to import 20 million Catholics.  Vatican City is a good place to go to war with, especially because as a Christian Nation, we should focus on the highest percentage of anti-christians and non-christians in our nation, and that's Catholics.  As non-christians, they believe in the pagan belief of "salvation through income redistribution" (they call it 'good works'), and are a domestic threat to our sovereignty. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments...
cereal_killer 1 points 6 days ago Why does that make sense? Look: I love America, and I would absolutely hate to see China become ascendant over her. However, China isn't trying to turn our kids gay or block out the sun or flood Western nations with brown people. China didn't force us to give up our manufacturing base. China didn't make us set up the Federal Reserve and repeal the gold standard. China didn't send us to war in the Middle East. China doesn't let black criminals wander American streets. If you are looking for a fight, there are plenty to be had closer to home. permalink parent award report block reply djentropyhardcore -1 points 6 days ago As you can see from my comment, I mentioned the two countries responsible for hurting the United States: China is communist, and uses slave labor to undercut our markets.  They are the biggest existential threat to us as they continue to grow and gain power.  They also fund transgender propaganda here, through spies, the WHO, and the UN, because they have too many men due to their former one child policy, and need American women to sustain their population.

tommygigantica 12 points 6 days ago yes it's pam bondi sitting there not doing a damn thing, but it is trumps fault since he refuses to do the right thing ever since his first term! never fired Barr, Wray, Fauci, or threw Hillary in prison as promised. could have come in handy during the stolen election in 2020 with true patriots in those positions. Now he's doing more of the same, hasn't fired bondi, in fact doing the opposite by praising her every chance he gets. this is trumps fault for not doing a damn thing about anything. especially all the voter fraud still going on. he's been in office for almost a year and still no arrests. permalink award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 4 points 6 days ago Honestly, the way Trump defended her after she fumbled on the Epstein stuff told me all I needed to know. permalink parent award report block reply

Kilroy 2 points 6 days ago That's what I don't get, Bondi came out and stated ANYONE  who messes with or impedes ICE in any way will get arrested and charged. That part was excellent.
But, zero follow through on anybody more important than a city employee I know they have the evidence to put most of the problem children in prison for 20 years to life. She either needs to run with it and do what she said she'd do or resign in disgrace and admit she's a loser. permalink award report block reply
