This shutdown would've been over 30 days ago if Dems had to stay up there and talk the entire time. People would see exactly who is shutting the government down and why but Republicans seem like they're trying to lose this. permalink parent award report block reply 45fan 9 points 4 days ago Ironically, the 60 votes to end debate was to stop assholes from filibustering. At the time sensible Congress critters used it to stop the hurdle of Senators that just wouldn't stop talking. Now the 60 vote threshold itself is being abused.

Democrats proposed a one-year extension of the enhanced health care subsidies which includes illegals.  They are in session until that gets written and voted on. permalink award report block reply HoganT -5 points 4 days ago The ACA does not include nor allow illegals. You\u2019re talking about average Americans health insurance premiums going up by $1000 a month. permalink parent award report block reply MikeyisNinja 12 points 4 days ago Premiums going up because of the affordable healthcare act. Who knew government subsidies make things more unaffordable permalink parent award report block reply Above_Reproach 3 points 4 days ago Now do food subsidies. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -4 points 4 days ago How about we put forward some health care reform then? I mean, we ran for a decade of repealing and replacing Obamacare. But President Trump seems to like the ACA. Regardless, jumping people\u2019s monthly cost by $1000 or more ain\u2019t good politics, fren. permalink parent award report block reply MikeyisNinja 5 points 4 days ago The best reform would be to let the system crash and let the market reset itself lol no amount of government money is going to solve the problem. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments...

SemperFidelis231 2 points 4 days ago \"The ACA does not include nor allow illegals.\" This has got to be the dumbest shit I've read in ages. You know what else doesn't include nor allow illegals? Voting. But they do that shit all the time. It doesn't matter what a program \"includes or allows\" if no one is actually checking it. Or worse, you have Dems actively pushing them onto it. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -1 points 4 days ago So you\u2019re stance is we can\u2019t fund the ACA because of possible fraud by illegals? How easy do you think it is easy obtain fake identity and a health insurance policy with it? How many fraudster illegals are we talking about here that it\u2019s worth upping people\u2019s monthly insurance premiums from $350 to $1350? Shit you could say funding ANYTHING is about funding illegals by this flimsy ass standard. permalink parent award report block reply SemperFidelis231 1 points 3 days ago We shouldn't be funding the ACA period. Its an abomination of a bill that's driven healthcare prices through the roof. It exists solely to destroy the healthcare industry and force a single payer system. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 0 points 4 days ago Your expecting people to do their research. Folks don't understand ACA was not the only thing the democrats asked for. the ACA is overall not terrible for them - but they think the dirty xeno's will get it so they will happily slip into poverty and starve themselves. permalink parent award report block reply GodKingHarambe 9 points 4 days ago After he allowed Democrat faggots like Ruben Gallego to roam the countryside campaigning for other Democrat faggots all while  collecting his Senate check, permalink award report block reply Juzeza 6 points 4 days ago I\u2019m working, you should be too permalink award report block reply MemeWarsVet 5 points 4 days ago This is substantial why? permalink award report block reply VirTW 5 points 4 days ago They bring in the mattresses when this happens....we will get to see schumer in his jammies permalink award report block reply daty_dato 2 points 4 days ago Doesn't matter what they do, it has an end date. permalink parent award report block reply Kraken_V_Algorithm 1 points 4 days ago I don't the think that meets the Senate dress code permalink parent award report block reply YodaBannon 1 points 4 days ago Depends tm permalink parent award report block reply 4886Battery 4 points 4 days ago The calls for removing the filibuster must've spooked him, has to look like he's doing something, Lord forbid he grew a spine and some principles leafed and he'd have to be a man and confront the Dems like they will no doubt confront the GOP once they regain some control. permalink award report block reply joesfbi 1 points 4 days ago He needs the fillibuster to keep the excuses.
