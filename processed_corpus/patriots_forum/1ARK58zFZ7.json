No Matter How Severe The Baldness HaloGrow TheGreatWhiteNorth 57 points 4 days ago We need to get rid of the tyrannical socialist healthcare scam system in Canada, too.  This facade of a country that calls itself Canada -- in every way, shape, and form -- needs President Trump to take over and claw it back from the Marxist-globalists. Monroe Doctrine, Manifest Destiny https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113794510592692386 permalink award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 17 points 4 days ago The Canadians can handle their own shit. I\u2019m more concerned about what happens within our borders. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 7 points 4 days ago No, we can't.  We're only around 43 million people uselessly spread across a vast winter wasteland.  Our last hurrah was the Freedom Convoy.  Remember how that turned out?  Right.  Explain how we can handle the Marxist-globalist attack on our own when even the United States was about to be written off if it wasn't for Trump backed by the US military. permalink parent award report block reply FrmrAmericanRepublic 8 points 4 days ago Assuming that firearms still exist in Canada, I'd use USA history as a guide on that score. Like we hear often here, you don't vote your way out of communism/marxism. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 1 points 4 days ago Like I already said, we're only around 43 million people uselessly spread across vast distances from each other.  You think Canadians can 'get together' and shoot their way out of this?  Trump would never allow for the slaughter of innocent Canadians.  Meantime, he has made it very clear that Canada can only work as the 51st State. permalink parent award report block reply view 16 more comments...

That makes my argument even better.  Clearly, Canada is doomed unless Trump takes over. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Moose_Antlers 2 points 4 days ago This is important. Geopolitically we need our Canadian northern shield. They're our missile shield and first strike detection for Russian ICBMs. They're our northern flank and our bridge between Alaska and the lower 48. They're resource-rich and come from a common ethnic and cultural heritage. We'll even tolerate the French. The Cajuns can bridge the gap, there =) There is no rational reason on this Earth to give up on Canada, or to find ourselves in an intractable squabble with them. If the Marxists are a problem, we need to help them with that, for our own good as well as theirs. It may take some courage to sever from the Commonwealth and figure out precisely what a new path truly independent of the British Parliament and Crown really looks like. Junior partnership with the US isn't a great solution to try and sell. True partnership (ie statehood) is much better - but I can understand the immense pushback such a suggestion receives from proud and patriotic Canadians who value their own unique identity. Hard choices. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 1 points 3 days ago I can agree with you on this. With the way things are rolling out step by step (as if on schedule), I'd say our 'connection' with the Commonwealth has already been severed.  We're simply going through the motions that will conclude with Canada becoming the 51st State.  What's important here is optics, and getting everyone on both sides of the border to (gladly) accept the inevitable first.  Meantime, the 'squeeze' continues on Canada.  Carnage Carney is doing his 'best' to make sure Canada breaks apart.  I'd be tempted to call him Central Casting at this point. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 1 points 4 days ago I answered under the assumption that you were an American saying we need to go into Canada to fix what is going on up there. I feel your pain but we\u2019re going to have to try and get what\u2019s going on down here fixed before we can give you guys an hand. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 0 points 3 days ago President Trump is the GOAT.  Don't underestimate that man.  The progress he's made for America and the rest of the world so far is mind-blowing. Meantime, think national security.  Don't forget the Golden Dome. May 27, 2025 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114581970051938528 TRUMP:  I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!\n. September 30, 2025 President Donald Trump Address Military Leaders at Quantico https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk_rdU0-UTI TRUMP:  We're investing tens of billions of 32:04\ndollars in modernizing our nuclear deterrence capabilities like never before. And we've begun construction on 32:10\nwhat we call the Golden Dome missile defense shield. It'll be the most sophisticated in the world. You watched 32:15\nit do well until they had some problems at the end with a little bit of a lack 32:23\nof ammunition, defensive ammunition, but they've got that taken care of. But I 32:30\ntell you, it's uh what we're doing is so good and we deserve it. You know, we we help other countries with it. We don't 32:36\nhave it ourselves. And Canada called me a couple of weeks ago. They want to be part of it. to\n32:42\nwhich I said,\"Well, why don't you just join our country? You become 51, become the 51st state and you get it for free.\" 32:51\nSo, I don't know if that made a big impact, but it does make a lot of sense. It actually because they're having a 32:57\nhard time up there in Canada now because, as you know, with tariffs, everyone's coming into our country. We 33:02\nhave more investment than we've ever had before. 17 trillion dollars coming in. permalink parent award report block reply Than0sIII 17 points 4 days ago United Continent of America, lesgo. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 17 points 4 days ago Fortress America.

I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon permalink parent award report block reply Moose_Antlers 1 points 4 days ago US + Canada, sure. But the imports have to go first. I'm not interested in the Chinese and Indian subcontinent contingents being annexed and added, and the Marxist Francophones can stay too (non-Marxists welcome). But I'm ruling out the Hispanics. They've had 70 years since Eisenhower's mass deportation to prove that they could come in legally and integrate. They don't. And I don't ever want to have to speak Spanish to some ... client... because he's unable to speak a word of English despite being in the country for a decade or more. They can unite in Mexico if they want. permalink parent award report block reply tpactionchasethevote 13 points 4 days ago Obamacare forces everyone to contribute to the Rockefeller allopathic system of petroleum based pharmaceuticals, symptoms, and surgeries while ignoring cheap or natural cures, prevention, nutrition, and root causes permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 6 points 4 days ago Same in Canada but much worse. permalink parent award report block reply Mathelm 6 points 4 days ago Well good for Canada, that because someone's grandfather MAY have fished by an area they can now take your home. One trial court judge invalidated ALL property rights, so yeah. permalink parent award report block reply Washington_Redskins 3 points 4 days ago Teach a man to fish and feed him for a day.. Let a man fish from your property and lose it for a lifetime. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 0 points 4 days ago That makes no sense at all. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 1 points 4 days ago Yup.  There's that, too. permalink parent award report block reply NomadicKrow2 1 points 4 days ago Woah, what happened? permalink parent award report block reply Mathelm 1 points 4 days ago \u2018Cowichan case\u2019 : Injin tribe sued for land, on the \"reconciliation\" principle, that they hold some Indigenous Title to 750 Hectares of Land; So a judge awarded them this land, the land is within Richmond BC, which is almost completely developed with homes. So this slice of land has been given to this tribe, forcing all of the current property owners to lose their titles to their homes. 95% of British Columbia wasn't officially \"ceded\" with each individual tribe, so now there are numerous bullshit tribes coming out of the literal woodwork, suing to take the land. Currently the entire city of Kamaloops is now under lawsuit. This is just further proof that humanity can never leave a single survivor when conquering another civilization. European politeness has just destroyed all notion of property rights in BC if not Canada. permalink parent award report block reply NomadicKrow2 2 points 4 days ago I think I'd have to tell Chief Steals Your Home to suck my dick or get off my property. Any words after that would be met with gunfire.

TheGreatWhiteNorth 0 points 3 days ago It's not the survivors that are the problem.  Most of the native Indians don't like this shite either.  They don't get much say, they don't get heard.  Their Chiefs are corrupt.  Guess who's getting paid off. The problem is our corrupt government.  We have Marxist-globalists running (collapsing) Canada.  They're doing it on purpose.  It's what they do.  That's a HUGE problem. permalink parent award report block reply DCPower 5 points 4 days ago Heh, years ago, Canadian healthcare was touted as way better than American. I told them to give it time. Now Canadian Healthcare prescribes death if the treatment is too expensive or the wait is too long. Reminds me of an old joke: a farmer is going along with his horse pulling a cart. Unfortunately, a car ends up colliding with them and the horse is badly wounded while the farmer has a banged up leg. A police officer comes along, hearing the horse crying out in pain and seeing that it\u2019s not going to make it, pulls his gun out and puts the horse out of its misery. The officer than approaches the farmer, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, you\u2019re horse was so badly injured, that I had to put it down so it wouldn\u2019t suffer anymore. How are you doing?\u201d The farmer replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 3 points 4 days ago Not such a funny joke for those living in Canada. Logan's Run.  50 is the new 30 with the option to off yourself sooner should you feel a little down. permalink parent award report block reply DCPower 2 points 4 days ago Well the irony is that those who are now offered death as healthcare were the ones shoving it in our faces about their great system. The American system is an abomination, but it still beats getting prescribed death. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 2 points 3 days ago I'd argue that the original American system was excellent.  It is currently being restored by President Trump.  Good men need to be at the top if you want 'The Great Experiment' in freedom and sovereignty to succeed.  The world is learning a big lesson about this fundamental fact. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... load 22 more comments... hughjasske69 48 points 4 days ago Hurry up and get it done so I can buy a policy that I need and can afford instead of subsidizing all the lazy fuckers who refuse to work permalink award report block reply anotherthing 15 points 4 days ago I'm not sure why Trump is blaming the insurance companies on this. It's the same insurance companies that were providing my coverage before ObamaCare at a reasonable rate that still exist today with the insane premiums. The only difference would be ObamaCare. I thought they were expensive at the time, before ObamaCare, but holy shit. They're so much worse now. permalink parent award report block reply Here_we_go 13 points 4 days ago $300 a week for me and husband with an 8k deductible.

That $8k deductible won\u2019t cover shit. permalink parent award report block reply NomadicKrow2 5 points 4 days ago My company's insurance now has like an 8k deductible. Once that's paid, they'll cover 100% of anything aft- Oh wait, no. Nope! This year, after the deductible, they cover 75%! permalink parent award report block reply glasscrawler 4 points 4 days ago And your insurance company probably said to the hospital: \"we negotiated 15k, here's 7k and bill the rest to the patient\". permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 8 points 4 days ago I'm not sure why Trump is blaming the insurance companies on this. Because it's popular. Trump has a political sense of how to appeal to people that RINO's have never had. Trump can say he's fighting the insurance companies, but then sneak in some actual good policy ideas if Republicans actually pass a healthcare bill. permalink parent award report block reply MastaJoda 4 points 4 days ago I paid $320/mon full health and dental for my wife and son before it tripled under Obamacare. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 4 days ago My company dropped the highest tier insurance, added a lower tier so there were still three tiers, and it still went up. That company was still paying the same percentage. permalink parent award report block reply ADAM_SCHITT 4 points 4 days ago The insurance companies pushed for and helped create 0bamacare because it would lead to higher profits for them. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 4 days ago Except they didn't.

Insurance companies are profit making companies. The premium is set to make money relative to the information they have from very large data sets of people who were as old and as sick as you and data sets of costs to treat these conditions. On the other hand, healthcare is a losing proposition. You are sick and needs treatment will cost a certain amount and then you are cured, but you will not repay the costs to cure you. The most cost effective way to cure you would be to death panel you. Government is in the loss business. It either takes over excess medial costs from insurers (leaving them to manage the medical settings that diagnose and provide treatment options within a predefined set of frameworks) or take over catastrophic insurance costs regardless of insurer management of medical practices. If you find something new outside those options, in 30 years they might hand you a Nobel Prize in Economics. permalink parent award report block reply glasscrawler 2 points 4 days ago I would want a discount plan or insurance for anything above 10k, handling everything below that by myself. But I can't get anything like that because of government regulations, and I can't switch insurance whenever I want, also because of government regulations. permalink parent award report block reply josiborg 24 points 4 days ago I paid $300/mo for the best amazing BCBS pre-obamacare. It won't get back to that good but it's gotta get better than now. permalink award report block reply LostElf 16 points 4 days ago Never thought I'd be nostalgic for insurance. BCBS was so good back in the day. Got \"the letter\" this week. Cost doubled.

No co-pays, no minimum out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in.   Dental and vision. Now, if I want a similar plan I had in 2008, I have to spend $650 a PAYCHECK.  Now, granted, I'm paid very well.  But for a family with little to no health care issues, 8% of my paycheck every two weeks is fucking absurd. So I had to drop down to one of the mid-tier plans, which means the first $5,000 worth of medical expenses every year comes out of my pocket first before insurance even starts to kick in. permalink parent award report block reply Iliterallylovejv 23 points 4 days ago I just did open enrollment at my company. Currently, I have an amazing PPO plan for Family coverage at $1020 a month. They\u2019ve now scrapped that plan, and all that remains is high deductible plans at basically the same price ($10 more a month). I must meet the deductible before insurance kicks in. Insurance is a scam. These companies deserve the worst fates. permalink award report block reply NY2KCMO1776 -1 points 4 days ago LUIGI  did nothing wrong and that's a hill I will die on.

Also, the Obamacare subsidies are INSANE. I lost my job for about 4 months so we were only on my wife's income at $82,000 a year for a family of 5, and we qualified for a plan that was the equivalent of $950/month at ZERO dollars a month for me. Then plan was mediocre. Think about that for a second, my wife and I earned over $80,000/year and they were still giving us nearly $12,000 in subsidies for an ACA plan. Absolutely bonkers. Oh and once I got a job it didn't matter, I didn't fall off the plan as you are enrolled for the whole year. The amount of cash handouts is exactly why inflation has been so bad. In reality though, this is nothing more than taxpayer money going direct into the pockets of the insurance companies. Of that $12,000 that went to the insurance companies, I used exactly ZERO claims this last year. It was just a big fat check to them. They are making BILLIONS on the American people. permalink award report block reply BlackPilledMAGA 3 points 4 days ago The insurance companies are the ones behind the whole thing.

I don\u2019t want to have to buy a policy myself. permalink award report block reply Tmntnyc 1 points 4 days ago Most people here would not have qualified for insurance before ACA. With ACA there is a mandate that preexisting conditions cannot be used to deny health insurance or to adjust pricing. Used to be that many people were \u201cuninsurable\u201d or had to buy plans that would cost much much more with exclusions for their known conditions. Survived cancer in your 30\u2019s? Diabetic? Heart condition? You literally had to buy insurance that excluded those things while paying more or go without any insurance. Oh, you have new onset migraines? I see in your medical record that you complained about a headache 5 years ago in a PCP visit\u2026sorry, no coverage for that. When they abolish ACA (Obamacare), most people will actually end up paying more or go uninsured. permalink award report block reply PoleWatcher 1 points 3 days ago Like I said it's all talk, but we really need to feel these changes and ideas that actually are pipe dreams.

So this slice of land has been given to this tribe, forcing all of the current property owners to lose their titles to their homes. 95% of British Columbia wasn't officially \"ceded\" with each individual tribe, so now there are numerous bullshit tribes coming out of the literal woodwork, suing to take the land. Currently the entire city of Kamaloops is now under lawsuit. This is just further proof that humanity can never leave a single survivor when conquering another civilization.

I told them to give it time. Now Canadian Healthcare prescribes death if the treatment is too expensive or the wait is too long. Reminds me of an old joke: a farmer is going along with his horse pulling a cart. Unfortunately, a car ends up colliding with them and the horse is badly wounded while the farmer has a banged up leg. A police officer comes along, hearing the horse crying out in pain and seeing that it\u2019s not going to make it, pulls his gun out and puts the horse out of its misery. The officer than approaches the farmer, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, you\u2019re horse was so badly injured, that I had to put it down so it wouldn\u2019t suffer anymore. How are you doing?\u201d The farmer replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 3 points 4 days ago Not such a funny joke for those living in Canada.

Clearly, Canada is doomed unless Trump takes over. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nMoose_Antlers 2 points 4 days ago This is important. Geopolitically we need our Canadian northern shield. They're our missile shield and first strike detection for Russian ICBMs. They're our northern flank and our bridge between Alaska and the lower 48. They're resource-rich and come from a common ethnic and cultural heritage. We'll even tolerate the French. The Cajuns can bridge the gap, there =) There is no rational reason on this Earth to give up on Canada, or to find ourselves in an intractable squabble with them. If the Marxists are a problem, we need to help them with that, for our own good as well as theirs. It may take some courage to sever from the Commonwealth and figure out precisely what a new path truly independent of the British Parliament and Crown really looks like. Junior partnership with the US isn't a great solution to try and sell. True partnership (ie statehood) is much better - but I can understand the immense pushback such a suggestion receives from proud and patriotic Canadians who value their own unique identity. Hard choices. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 1 points 3 days ago I can agree with you on this. With the way things are rolling out step by step (as if on schedule), I'd say our 'connection' with the Commonwealth has already been severed.  We're simply going through the motions that will conclude with Canada becoming the 51st State.  What's important here is optics, and getting everyone on both sides of the border to (gladly) accept the inevitable first.  Meantime, the 'squeeze' continues on Canada.  Carnage Carney is doing his 'best' to make sure Canada breaks apart.  I'd be tempted to call him Central Casting at this point. permalink parent award report block reply\nTheGreatWhiteNorth 1 points 3 days ago I can agree with you on this.

Now Canadian Healthcare prescribes death if the treatment is too expensive or the wait is too long. Reminds me of an old joke: a farmer is going along with his horse pulling a cart. Unfortunately, a car ends up colliding with them and the horse is badly wounded while the farmer has a banged up leg. A police officer comes along, hearing the horse crying out in pain and seeing that it\u2019s not going to make it, pulls his gun out and puts the horse out of its misery. The officer than approaches the farmer, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, you\u2019re horse was so badly injured, that I had to put it down so it wouldn\u2019t suffer anymore.

Insurance companies are profit making companies. The premium is set to make money relative to the information they have from very large data sets of people who were as old and as sick as you and data sets of costs to treat these conditions. On the other hand, healthcare is a losing proposition. You are sick and needs treatment will cost a certain amount and then you are cured, but you will not repay the costs to cure you. The most cost effective way to cure you would be to death panel you. Government is in the loss business. It either takes over excess medial costs from insurers (leaving them to manage the medical settings that diagnose and provide treatment options within a predefined set of frameworks) or take over catastrophic insurance costs regardless of insurer management of medical practices. If you find something new outside those options, in 30 years they might hand you a Nobel Prize in Economics. permalink parent award report block reply glasscrawler 2 points 4 days ago I would want a discount plan or insurance for anything above 10k, handling everything below that by myself.

Because it's popular. Trump has a political sense of how to appeal to people that RINO's have never had. Trump can say he's fighting the insurance companies, but then sneak in some actual good policy ideas if Republicans actually pass a healthcare bill. permalink parent award report block reply\nMastaJoda 4 points 4 days ago I paid $320/mon full health and dental for my wife and son before it tripled under Obamacare. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 4 days ago My company dropped the highest tier insurance, added a lower tier so there were still three tiers, and it still went up.

Insurance companies are profit making companies. The premium is set to make money relative to the information they have from very large data sets of people who were as old and as sick as you and data sets of costs to treat these conditions. On the other hand, healthcare is a losing proposition. You are sick and needs treatment will cost a certain amount and then you are cured, but you will not repay the costs to cure you. The most cost effective way to cure you would be to death panel you. Government is in the loss business. It either takes over excess medial costs from insurers (leaving them to manage the medical settings that diagnose and provide treatment options within a predefined set of frameworks) or take over catastrophic insurance costs regardless of insurer management of medical practices. If you find something new outside those options, in 30 years they might hand you a Nobel Prize in Economics. permalink parent award report block reply glasscrawler 2 points 4 days ago I would want a discount plan or insurance for anything above 10k, handling everything below that by myself.

Also, the Obamacare subsidies are INSANE. I lost my job for about 4 months so we were only on my wife's income at $82,000 a year for a family of 5, and we qualified for a plan that was the equivalent of $950/month at ZERO dollars a month for me. Then plan was mediocre. Think about that for a second, my wife and I earned over $80,000/year and they were still giving us nearly $12,000 in subsidies for an ACA plan. Absolutely bonkers. Oh and once I got a job it didn't matter, I didn't fall off the plan as you are enrolled for the whole year. The amount of cash handouts is exactly why inflation has been so bad. In reality though, this is nothing more than taxpayer money going direct into the pockets of the insurance companies. Of that $12,000 that went to the insurance companies, I used exactly ZERO claims this last year. It was just a big fat check to them. They are making BILLIONS on the American people. permalink award report block reply\nBlackPilledMAGA 3 points 4 days ago The insurance companies are the ones behind the whole thing.

I don\u2019t want to have to buy a policy myself. permalink award report block reply\nTmntnyc 1 points 4 days ago Most people here would not have qualified for insurance before ACA. With ACA there is a mandate that preexisting conditions cannot be used to deny health insurance or to adjust pricing. Used to be that many people were \u201cuninsurable\u201d or had to buy plans that would cost much much more with exclusions for their known conditions. Survived cancer in your 30\u2019s? Diabetic? Heart condition? You literally had to buy insurance that excluded those things while paying more or go without any insurance. Oh, you have new onset migraines? I see in your medical record that you complained about a headache 5 years ago in a PCP visit\u2026sorry, no coverage for that. When they abolish ACA (Obamacare), most people will actually end up paying more or go uninsured. permalink award report block reply\nPoleWatcher 1 points 3 days ago Like I said it's all talk, but we really need to feel these changes and ideas that actually are pipe dreams.

If you're like our state, look around you at hospital expansion. Our hospitals made a killing during covid, not only of patients but on their finances too. Also, if all the illegals and freeloaders are removed from taxpayer funded programs, the rest of us will have our costs go way down because we won't be paying for the illegals/freeloaders. permalink award report block reply\nPoleWatcher 0 points 4 days ago Better staet feeling so e relief,  his talk is just vaporizing.
