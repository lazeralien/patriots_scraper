They have an inordinately difficult time when it comes to streamlining code. permalink award report block reply Jack_NC 22 points 6 hours ago Because inventing and creating takes talent. Copying the work of others takes very little at all. According to my programmer friend, you'd be shocked at how many programmers fail the most basic assignments during an interview. Print a list of numbers 1-10. If the number is evenly divisible by 2 print \"fizz\". If it's divisible by 3 print \"buzz.\"  If both, \"fizzbuzz.\" That's it. Apparently that is really, really simple but most \"programmers\" can't do it! He said he has interviewed dozens of supposedly experienced programmers who can't do this. To use an analogue, it would be like asking a chef to boil an egg and he had to look at a cookbook, then still failed to do it. Or asked a carpenter to build a 1' square box out of wood, but couldn't do it. Yet we're importing people who are supposedly \"skilled\"? Seems like a total scam to me. (now, I hope this is right and I've probably confused something - my programmer friend explained this just this weekend and showed me how to do it -- wrote it out on a napkin at a restaurant, and it seemed to make sense but I'm not a programmer so who knows.\nBTW, my programmer friend has been out of work for 2 years and now drives a beer truck just to make ends meet. Can't get a job in software because he's not indian and is \"too old\" (over 50).\nWhat a mess our country has become.) permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 8 points 5 hours ago SAAR!

Bill Gates attended Harvard, enrolling in 1973 with an SAT score of 1590 (which made him a National Merit Scholar). In 1975, Gates dropped out, and though he never completed his undergraduate degree, Harvard later awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2007, recognizing his achievements. Pretty CHEAP degree if you ask me, lol. He shot up like a rocket by joining forces with Steve Jobs and stealing \u201cwindows\u201d from the MacIntosh design. Proof that you gotta nip that shit in the bud before it grows into world genocide by a Superman villain for personal entertainment. permalink parent award report block reply Crappydatum 2 points 5 hours ago Steve Jobs stole it from Xerox Parc first. That's why he couldn't complain much permalink parent award report block reply YaharaRiver 2 points 5 hours ago I found this in 2 seconds flat.  Why didn\u2019t you?? \u201cThe claim that Steve Jobs stole ideas from Xerox PARC is a myth that has been thoroughly debunked by multiple sources. Xerox PARC did not own the foundational ideas of the graphical user interface (GUI) or the computer mouse; these concepts originated with researchers like Douglas Engelbart, whose work predates Xerox's development. When Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979, he was shown the Alto computer, which featured a GUI with icons and a mouse, but Xerox had no intention of commercializing the technology for the mass market. The visit was a strategic exchange: Xerox allowed Apple to see the technology in return for stock options before Apple\u2019s IPO, as Xerox\u2019s management had rejected the project due to its high cost, bulkiness, and lack of consumer appeal.\u201d permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I use AI daily for scripting and it sucks.  I have to dip into my deep knowledge all the time to fix the code it creates permalink parent award report block reply Watermelons 3 points 5 hours ago You need to learn to use it properly then.  I suggest one of the CLI tools (codex or claude).  You have to set up a lot of things prior to get it to work well. Basically, treat it like a junior developer who can get things done but has a short memory.  So, making guides, rules and tests is the very first step before unleashing it on anything.  It will excel at problem solving through logs and guides once you give it correct context. permalink parent award report block reply Elencher 3 points 5 hours ago This to me is the ultimate damning of AI. People have kept saying \"just imagine how good it will be in 5 years\" when in reality we've entered into the plateau stage where they're throwing exponentially more resources at the problem for epsilon improvement. Meanwhile AI pulls off an impressive magic trick that almost looks like it works but doesn't quite get there, so you have to review everything. Except why do you know how to review the AI code? Because you've spent 10,000 hours of your life writing code. So in order to use AI to code....I need to code. But if nobody's writing code then nobody has the experience to actually use AI... Honestly I think the original \"vibe coding\" idea was the most pragmatic approach for this tech, where you intentionally don't even look at the code, but that barely got you to shitty half-assed demo stage, which is why they're all going down the agent road, but that just gets you writing reams of markdown instead of a small bit of code, so how the fuck is that an improvement? permalink parent award report block reply Crappydatum 2 points 5 hours ago AI can't create code, but it Can be used to repair code created by humans. The Tesla self driving code has been completely rewritten by AI. It's demonstrably better now. YMMV if you're using the free AI. permalink parent award report block reply DestroyerofCobwebs 7 points 5 hours ago There's a whole angle on this topic most Americans have forgotten about completely. We used to have tech schools in this country, DeVry being the biggest, but one of many.  Barack Obama's DoJ went after all of them in every way they could, with a clear goal of shutting them down.  It worked.  None of those tech schools that provided hundreds of thousands of American Citizens with tech education are around today, they've all closed up shop. The shit Eric Holder destroyed these institutions over were things the public universities were far more guilty of, but strangely they were untouched. So the US tech employee market hasn't just been betrayed, it's been actively sabotaged. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 2 points 5 hours ago This \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f permalink parent award report block reply NazisWereSocialist 6 points 5 hours ago Yeah first of all it's just not fucking true that we need H1-B's, it's not a genius visa, but even if we did need them I simply do not give a fuck, I don't want more minorities here. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver 1 points 5 hours ago well, step one is Stop calling them minorities.

Most coding is no more complex than a moderately complex DIY home improvement project. Learn the basics of tools, figure out what you want to do, try it, evaluate, repeat. Employers love that 3 year sponsorship control. permalink award report block reply Realassman 4 points 6 hours ago I disagree. They can probably write a good for loop at best, but cannot actually do domain specific programming.\nNot saying we need H1B for that,  but it requires a college level understanding of various domains. I have worked in medical imagine, reinsurance, real estate, fin tech and many more I don\u2019t see an 8th grader giving me what I need .\nA college kid, yes and yes, I agree with OP, we don\u2019t need H1B. permalink award report block reply dr_gonzo 4 points 4 hours ago I'm a developer and I've had to clean up the mess made by Indian consulting companies at my current job AND my last job. In both cases the projects were completely unsalvageable. It was as if the code was written by a an illiterate child. Spelling mistakes everywhere, 1500 line functions, nested conditionals inside nested loops inside other nested conditionals, variables named exactly the same except one character case difference...and BOTH misspelled. Try debugging THAT shit. Every basic 1st year CS rule was broken without exception. And these were both fairly expensive projects. The companies got nothing but headaches, followed by throwing them in the trashcan. I think a lot more employers have learned this lesson than some on PDW seem to think though. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 1 points 23 minutes ago This \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f Remember, Most corporations are run by bean counters. They look down their noses at the engineers who created the products the companies sell. It's amazing any of these companies manage to stay in business permalink parent award report block reply LastHearth 3 points 5 hours ago Can code is not the same thing as being able to hold a coding job.  In additional to being able to code, you also need to listening to instructions, work consistently and not whenever you want, and organize your time to meet deadlines, owe up to mistakes and take responsibility for them and not have a emotional breakdown because one got called out for those mistakes. The problem we have is the education system, which is not building the habits of  of maturity, responsibility, and diligence in the individuals that go through the system.  Yes some of them will still have those habits because they had good parents, or they are just naturally inclined to those habits. The current education system has failed, and until that is fixed it will never produce enough individuals to fill the labor demands of the high tech corporations. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 0 points 5 hours ago This \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f permalink parent award report block reply gunteh 3 points 5 hours ago The problem is H1-B's and Indian/Chinese managers have messed it up to the point where they would rather hire their own sh!tty programmers than to hire Americans who could cost more but do a better job, while gaslighting everyone else by saying, \"The Americans are too lazy or not interested in the jobs we are hiring in.\" BS.

The visit was a strategic exchange: Xerox allowed Apple to see the technology in return for stock options before Apple\u2019s IPO, as Xerox\u2019s management had rejected the project due to its high cost, bulkiness, and lack of consumer appeal.\u201d permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nStandingoak 4 points 6 hours ago Bill Gates has no college degree. permalink parent award report block reply Trumpican 6 points 5 hours ago He also likes 8th grade boys. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 5 points 5 hours ago Bill Gates is the devil permalink parent award report block reply YaharaRiver 4 points 5 hours ago Technically true.

Honestly I think the original \"vibe coding\" idea was the most pragmatic approach for this tech, where you intentionally don't even look at the code, but that barely got you to shitty half-assed demo stage, which is why they're all going down the agent road, but that just gets you writing reams of markdown instead of a small bit of code, so how the fuck is that an improvement? permalink parent award report block reply Crappydatum 2 points 5 hours ago AI can't create code, but it Can be used to repair code created by humans.

We used to have tech schools in this country, DeVry being the biggest, but one of many.  Barack Obama's DoJ went after all of them in every way they could, with a clear goal of shutting them down.  It worked.  None of those tech schools that provided hundreds of thousands of American Citizens with tech education are around today, they've all closed up shop. The shit Eric Holder destroyed these institutions over were things the public universities were far more guilty of, but strangely they were untouched.

Spelling mistakes everywhere, 1500 line functions, nested conditionals inside nested loops inside other nested conditionals, variables named exactly the same except one character case difference...and BOTH misspelled. Try debugging THAT shit. Every basic 1st year CS rule was broken without exception. And these were both fairly expensive projects.

In additional to being able to code, you also need to listening to instructions, work consistently and not whenever you want, and organize your time to meet deadlines, owe up to mistakes and take responsibility for them and not have a emotional breakdown because one got called out for those mistakes.
