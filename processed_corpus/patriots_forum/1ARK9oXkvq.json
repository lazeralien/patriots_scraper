Cmon guys, he's under attack! This is not hyperbole. This is actually his current life story if you have been watching. permalink award report block reply SenorTrumper OP 0 points 11 hours ago LOL My bad.  Instead of digging deeper for a gooder source, I picked him.  I was actually been thinking about posting about how the powers that be are handing over the biggest platforms  like YT and TikTok to you-know-who, and then seeing Jeremy's video, I thought this is the one I will use as a source.
