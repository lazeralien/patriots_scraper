To those who don't understand, fat people don't starve.  Given enough water, electrolytes, vitamins and some sun, they lose weight. I know this because I've been doing water fasts for three days a month for almost three years now.  Okay, I miss some months.  I also do intermittent fasting.    It is not true that skipping meals is bad for us.  I believed that almost my entire life, but as I found out, one of the best things you can do for your own health is skip meals, regularly. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day. No one needs breakfast to get going in the morning.  your body wakes up with a glucose spike from a process known as gluconeogenesis.  That's probably what wakes a person up from sleeping.   You might need some cafffeine in the morning (I recommend coffee with a bit of butter, salt and MTC oil, called bullet coffee) but no, you don't need to eat every meal and you don't need food all the time. permalink parent award report block reply Lurker6 1 points 5 days ago Still bitter that I was of the age where we went through the, \"oh, you shouldn't be eating 3 moderate sized meals with limited snacking in between.

I've been a yo-yo dieter my whole life and I thought it was important to not skip meals.   I was amazed how easy it was to lose weight and keep it off just by being keto and skipping meals. I can't believe how many stupid things I believed about diet and nutrition prior to going keto. permalink parent award report block reply keeman 5 points 6 days ago If you cut off her food stamps then perhaps that would provide some incentive.  Don't feed the animals, you just get dependent animals. permalink parent award report block reply that_sound 4 points 6 days ago Look, I don't care what people do in the privacy of their own homes. But public obesity should be a crime. And at this level it should be a felony. Nobody should ever have to look at something like that. It's disgusting. Children should never be allowed to see it. You don't want that kind of thing normalized. Nobody should grow up thinking being that fat is in any way ok. This person is clearly a threat to herself. Look at what she has done to herself by way of destroying her health. Involuntary institutionalization. Restricted diet, forced exercise, and classes on how to act like an adult. Any future probationary period should exclude any contact with children.

It fixes everything. Even cancer. Just drink some water and relax. After about two or three days, the hunger pangs go away and you can just chill out. You can go a good 30 days without any food and come out of it a better person. Jesus used to go into the desert for 40 days to fast and pray.

Blacks and various 3rd worlders don't possess the requisite IQ to live in a free society with whites and Asians, nor will they at any point in the next several centuries. That's just the reality. As a group, they're incapable of competing, which means if we don't ELIMINATE the social welfare programs, they will absolutely, 100% destroy the currency and crash our economy. That is guaranteed. It's already happening and will only get worse and worse as minorities increase in number, and as the interest payment on the national debt consumes a larger and larger piece of total federal revenue. Destroying the middle class, not to mention the free world, is not \"compassionate\". Charity must be PRIVATE and VOLUNTARY. If we don't have a dramatic shift in opinion on these idiotic government programs, we are absolutely fucked. permalink award report block reply C0drus 3 points 6 days ago \u201cGarden Gnomes\u201d \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 is this the term for joggers that takes the place of \u201cLawn Jockey\u201d? permalink award report block reply SvbHvman 3 points 6 days ago It'll take a while. permalink award report block reply Jimmyprawns 3 points 6 days ago Ain't nobody starving out there.

We qualified for like $400 a month, in 2011 money. Our previous budget was $150 for all our food, and while we didn't eat fancy, we had enough. $400 made us feel like we could eat like kings... we could get steaks, shrimp if we wanted, all the frozen food imaginable. Who cares if that bag of chips was overpriced, we never spent the full $400 anyway. Oh and, because it took them too long to process it, they back paid us like 2.5 months worth and deposited $1000 + $400 on our EBT card for the food stamps we missed. I couldn't believe it. I felt guilty shopping on it, but it was wild how beneficial it was. Now here is the thing... when my I got a slightly better income, we lost ALL benefits, food stamps, medicaid, and so on. We talked to the benefits department of our state and the person literally told us that if my wife cut back her hours from working or chose not to work, then our family income would be low enough to qualify for all these benefits again. They straight-up were recommending my wife to quit her job so we could qualify for welfare again. The system is broken. The incentives are broken. Welfare should be enough to keep you from starving. Give you rice and beans you need to cook yourself, with maybe a few other misc. proteins and carbs. But overall, it should not be something you live on. Thankfully, we were too proud to stay on the system. I wonder how many people would LOVE to be on the system and have all that crap paid for though. It offsets all these other expenses because now they get to spend other people's money on food. permalink award report block reply\n62jawbill 112 points 6 days ago Poor people were skinny when I was a kid. permalink award report block reply ImYourHuckleberry24 54 points 6 days ago Yep, including my own family growing up. permalink parent award report block reply The_Bloofy_Bullshark 19 points 6 days ago Yup.

It fixes everything. Even cancer. Just drink some water and relax. After about two or three days, the hunger pangs go away and you can just chill out. You can go a good 30 days without any food and come out of it a better person. Jesus used to go into the desert for 40 days to fast and pray.

Blacks and various 3rd worlders don't possess the requisite IQ to live in a free society with whites and Asians, nor will they at any point in the next several centuries. That's just the reality. As a group, they're incapable of competing, which means if we don't ELIMINATE the social welfare programs, they will absolutely, 100% destroy the currency and crash our economy. That is guaranteed. It's already happening and will only get worse and worse as minorities increase in number, and as the interest payment on the national debt consumes a larger and larger piece of total federal revenue. Destroying the middle class, not to mention the free world, is not \"compassionate\". Charity must be PRIVATE and VOLUNTARY.

We qualified for like $400 a month, in 2011 money. Our previous budget was $150 for all our food, and while we didn't eat fancy, we had enough. $400 made us feel like we could eat like kings... we could get steaks, shrimp if we wanted, all the frozen food imaginable. Who cares if that bag of chips was overpriced, we never spent the full $400 anyway. Oh and, because it took them too long to process it, they back paid us like 2.5 months worth and deposited $1000 + $400 on our EBT card for the food stamps we missed. I couldn't believe it. I felt guilty shopping on it, but it was wild how beneficial it was. Now here is the thing... when my I got a slightly better income, we lost ALL benefits, food stamps, medicaid, and so on. We talked to the benefits department of our state and the person literally told us that if my wife cut back her hours from working or chose not to work, then our family income would be low enough to qualify for all these benefits again. They straight-up were recommending my wife to quit her job so we could qualify for welfare again. The system is broken. The incentives are broken. Welfare should be enough to keep you from starving. Give you rice and beans you need to cook yourself, with maybe a few other misc. proteins and carbs. But overall, it should not be something you live on. Thankfully, we were too proud to stay on the system. I wonder how many people would LOVE to be on the system and have all that crap paid for though. It offsets all these other expenses because now they get to spend other people's money on food. permalink award report block reply"}
