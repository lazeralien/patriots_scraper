I went thru several government shutdowns and continued to work. I wasn't in a position to go without a check but I still went to work. permalink award report block reply greatpumpkin 2 points 2 days ago Trump also promised 'no tax on O.T.', not 'no tax on O.T. under 12.5k'. No offense, but get it nailed down in writing before you believe it. permalink award report block reply Roadpower 1 points 2 days ago Uhh, this is kind of backwards. The ATC's that stayed working are likely the one's that could afford to wait out the government shutdown. permalink award report block reply geckogreen 2 points 2 days ago So the folks who didn't work should get the bonus? permalink parent award report block reply Roadpower 1 points 2 days ago I can't say with any conviction that they should or shouldn't. However logic dictates that they were likely to be more in need of it. permalink parent award report block reply YaharaRiver -1 points 2 days ago So? Trump told us to PREPARE in 2017, by now everyone should be an expert! He is rewarding the ones who avoided disaster, which took years of forethought. Well done, Mr. President!!  The era of bailouts is dying! permalink parent award report block reply Callsign_Fox1 1 points 2 days ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink parent award report block reply\nSaltyAv8er 3 points 2 days ago Trump recommended 10k bonus, he didnt promise it.
