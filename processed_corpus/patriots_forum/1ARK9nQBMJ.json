There is a Costco near my home that has slowly turned into an Indian Bizarre. Total chaos, no lines, no manners, stinks, clothing all a giant mess. Shoes all taken out of the boxes and not put back. A giant disaster. So we got fed up and decided to drive 30 minutes to the Costco that is in a suburb outside of the city, that was about 5 months ago. What an amazing experience, yes, mostly white, farmers, small town folk. Everyone polite, manners, not loud, not messy, not stinky. Felt like the 90's again. Well, it was fun while it lasted. Went with my wife on Saturday, uggh. Looks like the foreigners discovered it and decided to leave the Hell Costco in the city for the small town Costco. Now the small town Costco, is also a hell Costco, they all fled from themselves to infect the next untarnished place. They are like PARASITES.\n18 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Elon Reveals the Real Reason He Walks Away From Trump Read More Ads by Ad.Style wharfthrowaway 7 points 2 hours ago That\u2019s always been the plan.

Will let you know what city. Every one of them. Okay, probably not the French ones, as words like 'also Haitians and Algerians and Burkina Faso people' were not used. Close the borders, ban them all and their invasion and their 'religion' which is their form of government they impose on you, or be wiped out like England and Canada. Several years ago, given the Costco card.  After a few visits, and the Third World India/Pakistan hateful staff there, never went back. A store where you have to show all your papers to an angry person from Calcutta, no, not going. permalink award report block reply\nwharfthrowaway 7 points 2 hours ago That\u2019s always been the plan.
