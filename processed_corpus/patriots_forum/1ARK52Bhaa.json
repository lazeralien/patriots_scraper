Aloha snackbar, get fucked permalink parent award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 3 points 5 days ago The fundamental reason why it has never worked is that it can't work even in theory. It's called the problem of information. No centralized body can possibly obtain sufficient information to know how much of any resource should be devoted towards producing something needed by everyone else. We see exactly the approach taken to solve this problem by the Soviets and it's hilarious. For instance, nails. Nails are such a simple and stupid sounding need, but they're essential for construction. There's no way for there to be enough communication to get the right amount of nails to everyone, and they come in a zillion different types according to purpose. The Soviets just planned the need for nail production by weight. The result was the nail makers just produced big nails for everything, because that was the easiest way to make quota. The actual solution to the problem of information is open market pricing. permalink parent award report block reply shadypollster 21 points 6 days ago Waco.

This coddled, champagne socialist muslim has never worked a day in his life and that's why he's a retard who would sell the government as the solution to everything. It's the same marketing message as every tyrant looking to weaponize the government. permalink award report block reply Tellman125 12 points 6 days ago He takes office on Jan 1, which means there's still nearly TWO WHOLE MONTHS while he's still in this hyper idealistic phase. Right now he's still in his campaign-rally/debate mode of being a 10th grader all giddy and over-eager to do his class presentation where he gets to impress the stupid woman fake-history teacher with all the bullshit he has memorized from her lectures and reading assignments. He was the most absent assembly member in his 4 years there. So, once he becomes mayor and has to start show up EVERY SINGLE DAY to 2 or 3 crisis locations (fires, gang violence, tragedies, emergencies), or tense union meetings, or business groups, or whatever ethnic group meetings (all sort of NON-Muslim ones he doesn't give a shit about), he'll start burning out fast and unravel and start saying shit that reveals how uninterested, underequipped, and unqualified he is for the job. His campaign was such a breeze, letting his TikTok videos do the work for him, and her kept up the phony grin for the 2 hours of the 2 debates, but he won't be able to keep that fucking phony grin on his face for that many hours a day, and with so many people telling him their stories, complaining to him, pleading with him, and hectoring him. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 4 points 6 days ago He will Be Bidened.

(also could be functional in that it is dependent on capitalist corps around it) edit: important to note some of the downsides of \"capitalism\" and socialism here bad \"capitalist\" corps today actually can act kind of \"fascist\" and do a worse job perhaps than some \"socialist\" governments. Take John Deere for example which has tried to lock down its products and prevent farmers from working on them with closed software designs. but then take downsides of a socialist gov: might prohibit competition which could drive up costs and stifle freedom which would create disincentives. I'm not totally sure what point I want to make with this. Maybe like beware this working to some extent, of them finding a way to create an illusion of it working? or of it genuinely working as a counter to \"bad corporations\" which do a bad job? back in early 2010s we had the tea party protesting big government (that would be Mamdani here) and occupy wallstreet protesting big bad corporations (that would be john deere in my example here, but I'm not intending to single out john deere or any one big corp, just trying to point to a specific harmful behavior that I thought john deere engaged in, of limiting working on the farming equipment that farmers owned). the problem is big government AND big corporations here. Mamdani may create something functional in truly opposing big bad corporations, but doesn't address the \"big bad government\" problem. A lot of \"capitalists\" on the right don't necessarily address the \"big bad corporations\" problem, maybe? permalink award report block reply roflcopt0rz_returns 2 points 6 days ago The main difference between a mega corporation like Amazon versus the government is that Amazon at the end of the day needs to make a profit, so there\u2019s a limit to how much they can fuck over their workers or the customers or else they will leave and Amazon stops making money. The government is not beholden to anyone as long as they get elected. And they\u2019ve shown they will money print, assassinate, steal elections, sic their police/army lapdogs, etc., all things that the mega corps can\u2019t do. They have zero incentive to actually appeal to the people as long as they don\u2019t piss off the people enough to where the people rise up and slay them. permalink parent award report block reply bluewhiteandred 1 points 6 days ago I kind of agree with what you're saying but let me see if there's anything I can question about it gov does have limits like amazon, i.e. people revolting if it got too out of hand? mega corps can engage in some of the shady things you mention like influence elections they can also get away with a lot of things because the average person can't necessarily start up a competitor easily and lots of random average person choose to do business with them rather than support smaller businesses sometimes, so although they need to make a profit they still have a lot of leverage? corps and gov are often run by the same people: gov gives big corps tax breaks and grants, gov bails out failing companies and banks, corp money is used to lobby for laws and electing people to push policies that favor the corps, etc. so, not really disagreeing necessarily, just trying to further the convo and add to what you described? permalink parent award report block reply roflcopt0rz_returns 1 points 6 days ago Yes, mega corps can throw their weight around to do unlawful and immoral stuff, but nowhere near to the extent the government can. Again, the government has a monopoly on violence as they control the police, army, alphabet agencies, etc. They also have more money than megacorps because they have money printer. Stopping the government from overreach of their authority will require you to actually stand up to them and often requires overthrowing them. Much different than just simply not shopping with Amazon and giving them money. Because Amazon cannot put a gun to your head and force you to obey by threat of violence or imprisonment. The government can. Mega corps can and do bully small businesses. But government can bully small businesses AND mega corps. permalink parent award report block reply ChilledCovfefe 1 points 5 days ago Both of you made excellent points. Let me take it one step further. I think we are in quasi fascism right now. Government and corporations are married together. Not all of them but pretty much ALL of the biggest ones.  Government uses them as their browshirts. The government uses corps and NGOs by proxy to implement policies that are against the law. Like vaccine rules during Covid, censorship, immigration etc.  With Trump in office it has been curtailed for now but I think we need to sever almost all government, corporate and NGO relationships or we are toast. The NGO shit was really started by Obama with the first 2000 page stimulus bill that created the first trillion dollar injections into leftist NGOs. The NGO and foundations need to be destroyed. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... entERmyMAtrix 1 points 6 days ago HahhahBhHbBbbBbhahahahahA permalink award report block reply Tacitus1963 1 points 6 days ago Watch this short 10 minute video about Mamdani and his and his father's connection to the same political ideology that is the ANC and EFF in South Africa. https://youtu.be/KvnUIfvYV_E?si=O0BElYYCjGj8eGjO permalink award report block reply Nanteen 1 points 6 days ago Remember when the GOP starts pointing out all of his failures next August for the elections.

This might be THE peak level of stupidity in world history. permalink award report block reply\nL74ge9wr 2 points 6 days ago \u201c\u2026 with YOUR money\u201d\nThere, fixed it for ya permalink award report block reply\nTyscribz 2 points 6 days ago every time the government tries to solve a problem \"Well it costs 5x more, it's generally a worse product, and the citizens that are still alive had everything they owned stolen from them ...\" permalink award report block reply\nInduceddrag 2 points 6 days ago If you don\u2019t like your problems, wait until you see our solutions. permalink award report block reply\nAut_MAGA_Aut_Nihil 2 points 6 days ago If government could solve anything it would have been solved by now.

(also could be functional in that it is dependent on capitalist corps around it) edit: important to note some of the downsides of \"capitalism\" and socialism here bad \"capitalist\" corps today actually can act kind of \"fascist\" and do a worse job perhaps than some \"socialist\" governments. Take John Deere for example which has tried to lock down its products and prevent farmers from working on them with closed software designs. but then take downsides of a socialist gov: might prohibit competition which could drive up costs and stifle freedom which would create disincentives. I'm not totally sure what point I want to make with this. Maybe like beware this working to some extent, of them finding a way to create an illusion of it working? or of it genuinely working as a counter to \"bad corporations\" which do a bad job? back in early 2010s we had the tea party protesting big government (that would be Mamdani here) and occupy wallstreet protesting big bad corporations (that would be john deere in my example here, but I'm not intending to single out john deere or any one big corp, just trying to point to a specific harmful behavior that I thought john deere engaged in, of limiting working on the farming equipment that farmers owned). the problem is big government AND big corporations here. Mamdani may create something functional in truly opposing big bad corporations, but doesn't address the \"big bad government\" problem. A lot of \"capitalists\" on the right don't necessarily address the \"big bad corporations\" problem, maybe? permalink award report block reply roflcopt0rz_returns 2 points 6 days ago The main difference between a mega corporation like Amazon versus the government is that Amazon at the end of the day needs to make a profit, so there\u2019s a limit to how much they can fuck over their workers or the customers or else they will leave and Amazon stops making money. The government is not beholden to anyone as long as they get elected. And they\u2019ve shown they will money print, assassinate, steal elections, sic their police/army lapdogs, etc., all things that the mega corps can\u2019t do.

Again, the government has a monopoly on violence as they control the police, army, alphabet agencies, etc. They also have more money than megacorps because they have money printer. Stopping the government from overreach of their authority will require you to actually stand up to them and often requires overthrowing them. Much different than just simply not shopping with Amazon and giving them money. Because Amazon cannot put a gun to your head and force you to obey by threat of violence or imprisonment. The government can. Mega corps can and do bully small businesses.
