Exposures without consequences are pointless. permalink award report block reply llirrem 1 points 7 days ago That's not money laundering, that's embezzlement. Money laundering is when you get money through illegal means (like drug dealing for example) and you put it into a cash based business (like a laundromat for example) so that the money becomes legal and taxable so the IRS won't come after you for tax fraud. Embezzlement is when money that was appropriated to you for a specific reason is used for non-approved purposes usually personal gain. permalink award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 7 days ago That is not illegal, provided it is disclosed. permalink award report block reply AlvinOfTheTrumpmunks 1 points 7 days ago Just toss it in the pile of things Gavin Newsom has done to warrant a federal investigation but it won't happen right now because of Pam Bondi. Hell some investigations may not be happening because of the current available venues being to heavy in Democrats favor. permalink award report block reply Eatinglue 1 points 7 days ago HEY PAM!
