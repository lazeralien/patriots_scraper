In a couple months it will be all about midterms, and squishy faggot RINOs won't want to do anything bold to support MAGA, as they appear to be in the \"let's just wait him out another year\" mode, tank in the midterms, setting up a two-year impeachment season. I hope he's just keeping IA as a last resort.   It would be wonderful to see a mega dose of justice for these traitors.   Backlash would be massive in the MSM, but I think his supporters would be 100% behind him on the \"REEEE - Autharitarian!!!!\" move. permalink parent award report block reply TheJakeFroggy 1 points 5 days ago It would make sense to keep the IA as a last resort. I'd understand if he was just keeping it as a last resort and that he's just wanted to try and exhaust all other options first. But I do think we've gotten to that point already. Pam Bondi and Kash Patel should've done mass arrests on deep staters, and haven't, and I don't trust them to do it because if they were gonna do it then you'd think they would've already started on it. If they and the Republicans in Congress were to actually do their damn jobs, then we wouldn't even have to think about the IA. But they've all failed to properly act, and as we've blown too much time and don't have much time remaining to stop the left, it's getting desperate. And I can trust Trump just enough to see the writing on the wall if there's no other choice. Also ngl I've grown to be cynical and spiteful enough that I would get big amounts of dopamine over the MSM and all the fanatical leftists losing their shit over Trump invoking the IA. They celebrated Charlie Kirk's assassination, shamelessly voted Jay Jones into itself and many other things, I would love nothing more than to watch them cry like overgrown babies when Trump crosses the rubicon and crushes them with the US military. permalink parent award report block reply JerryNadlerBeltFund 2 points 5 days ago The difference between us and them:  They celebrate our death, and the death of America.   We celebrate thier DEMISE. IF (HUUUUGE IF) John Soloman's reporting is accurate - expect many (up to 150) Russisgate grand jury subpoenas by the end of the year.  I hear Brennan and a few others are imminent.   (LOL - \"3000 sealed indictments\" memories from 2017 - I'm cynical as hell, too, so it's a little embarrassing to have any hope in this type of news).  My optimism comes from my belief that DJT is a VSG, and that he is fully aware that the deep state, if not crushed, will absolutely destrory him, his family and anyone who's openly supported him. The stakes are immeasurable for him, and that knowledge keeps the doom at bay. Using the IA is a drastic measure.  It should be an absolute last resort, but from what I understand, it could be very fast and effective.  In his shoes I probably would have lost patience by the end of Jan and invoked it. permalink parent award report block reply fskfsk 14 points 5 days ago The most likely outcome is that Republicans cuck and keep the filibuster, but Democrats remove it the next time they're a majority. permalink award report block reply HumblePepe 3 points 5 days ago I would bet within seconds of them getting in power and the next session starting, they end the filibuster and then begin tearing apart the country. permalink parent award report block reply ReleasetheList 3 points 5 days ago It's not the most likely outcome, it's the guaranteed outcome. What is also guaranteed is that the GOP will give the dems most of what they want to reopen the govt. permalink parent award report block reply fskfsk 1 points 5 days ago It sounds like the Republicans are prepared to make concessions to the Democrats.  Prediction markets now say they make a deal next week. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT 3 points 5 days ago They were never going to let people's insurance go up by 100's of percent. They know full well that is a mid term death sentence. They've just been trying to tarnish the dems with it by framing it as about illegals instead of about your health insurance costs and have run out of runway. It didn't work. permalink parent award report block reply lash 0 points 5 days ago Only if they want to be part of a military tribuna (their own). People like Rand Paul can get more involved for example. He should be the fucking leader there now, BUT HE SOLD OUT when he did not back Trump 2020. He should have seen the steal just as clear as we have!

The GOP doesn't give a shit about winning anything for the People. permalink parent award report block reply corporateshizer 5 points 5 days ago The uniparty keeps the filibuster because it gives them an excuse for not delivering results for their voters. Issue voter cares about: \"52-48, too bad, won't pass a filibuster so we scrapped it. Better win more seats next election!\" Sending money to Ukraine: 86-11, no filibuster at play. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 5 days ago Correctamundo. permalink parent award report block reply HumblePepe 5 points 5 days ago We all know what the Republicans will choose.

Also Speaker Johnson needs to kill any attempt to pass a Thune \"deal\" bill in the House so Trump isn't forced to veto. permalink award report block reply knnbccb 2 points 5 days ago This will be irrelevant if you outlaw the Democratic Party, and anyone who donates even a dime to it gets thrown into jail indefinitely without trial. Trump is still too kind, too soft-hearted. permalink award report block reply WeWillRideAgain 2 points 5 days ago Just revert the filibuster to  how it USED to be..

We celebrate thier DEMISE. IF (HUUUUGE IF) John Soloman's reporting is accurate - expect many (up to 150) Russisgate grand jury subpoenas by the end of the year.  I hear Brennan and a few others are imminent.   (LOL - \"3000 sealed indictments\" memories from 2017 - I'm cynical as hell, too, so it's a little embarrassing to have any hope in this type of news).  My optimism comes from my belief that DJT is a VSG, and that he is fully aware that the deep state, if not crushed, will absolutely destrory him, his family and anyone who's openly supported him. The stakes are immeasurable for him, and that knowledge keeps the doom at bay. Using the IA is a drastic measure.  It should be an absolute last resort, but from what I understand, it could be very fast and effective.  In his shoes I probably would have lost patience by the end of Jan and invoked it. permalink parent award report block reply\nfskfsk 14 points 5 days ago The most likely outcome is that Republicans cuck and keep the filibuster, but Democrats remove it the next time they're a majority. permalink award report block reply HumblePepe 3 points 5 days ago I would bet within seconds of them getting in power and the next session starting, they end the filibuster and then begin tearing apart the country. permalink parent award report block reply ReleasetheList 3 points 5 days ago It's not the most likely outcome, it's the guaranteed outcome. What is also guaranteed is that the GOP will give the dems most of what they want to reopen the govt. permalink parent award report block reply fskfsk 1 points 5 days ago It sounds like the Republicans are prepared to make concessions to the Democrats.  Prediction markets now say they make a deal next week. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT 3 points 5 days ago They were never going to let people's insurance go up by 100's of percent. They know full well that is a mid term death sentence. They've just been trying to tarnish the dems with it by framing it as about illegals instead of about your health insurance costs and have run out of runway. It didn't work. permalink parent award report block reply lash 0 points 5 days ago Only if they want to be part of a military tribuna (their own). People like Rand Paul can get more involved for example. He should be the fucking leader there now, BUT HE SOLD OUT when he did not back Trump 2020. He should have seen the steal just as clear as we have!
