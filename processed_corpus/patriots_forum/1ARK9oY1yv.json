While a few aliens are being deported - hoards of leeches are being imported to destroy our children's future.\nThere is no shortage of talent here in the USA, and the clowns that they are importing are not nearly as skilled as our fellow Americans (they are simply cheap labor who they hope to convert into new voters). permalink award report block reply fskfsk 35 points 13 hours ago Just look at how much consumer software is shit. My cable box software crashes and has to reboot once a week. It wasn't like that 10 years ago. Walgreen's AI customer support system is awful. I go to my credit card website, it takes a minute for the page to load.  Every time they update it, they take away features I was using. permalink parent award report block reply PedePete 27 points 13 hours ago ^^ This is absolutely another important factor.

NonyaDB 4 points 5 hours ago Probably because they're off-shoring development work. And since it's all ESLs nowadays first the ESL has to run the requirements they were emailed thru an AI to translate it (poorly) into their native tongue and then they write up an AI prompt in their native tongue which they then also run thru an AI translator (poorly) to create the shitty AI-generated English text which they then copy-pasta into yet another AI that generates poor code that they then copy-pasta into the production code without ever testing it first. And when it inevitably breaks, they lie to management about their development and testing process, usually by blaming anyone and anything other than their own incompetence. These fuckers will stab their fellow co-workers in the back like it was a new fad. Many such cases, and it's really prevalent at Microsoft in their O365 products which are always fucking up and going offline every week causing them to have to roll-back code changes. permalink parent award report block reply Pied-Trumper 7 points 11 hours ago Support is even more shit, which is ultimately what AI is for - to replace foreign support with even cheaper support at taxpayer expense. Mind you, these people have access to all your most private date, even health data, and they're from the centers of cybercrime. permalink parent award report block reply NotYourMan 6 points 4 hours ago H1B-visa is NOT about high quality.  Its about lower cost and employees that are easy to control.  In my experience, H1B-visa engineers steal from US employees and they are easy to control.  They lie steal, back stab and do exactly what management tells them because they like making millions on high-tech stock. permalink parent award report block reply cosmos411 2 points 15 minutes ago No better way to force blind loyalty than hanging an H1B over their turbans.

The devolution of America over the past few decades has been nauseating to behold and it's accelerating at a horrific pace. permalink parent award report block reply NotYourMan 2 points 4 hours ago Successful countries do not need immigrant workers at all.  Germany, France, UK, and the US didn't need any immigrants starting in the 1980s to take away jobs.  That was nothing more than a power grab by politicians.  Immigrants can't vote or they can be used to generate illegal, fake ballots.  They are easy to control because they don't want to go back.  Immigrants benefit the ruling class and if they are violent then they create chaos so that the politicians can steal without anybody noticing. permalink parent award report block reply patrioticwinning3 59 points 14 hours ago Wonder why we are getting spammed with H1B shit?

There is no \u201cZionist punishment campaign\u201d sending Indian or Chinese workers to America. The H-1B system is not run out of Tel Aviv. It is run out of the Department of Labor and Silicon Valley HR departments. The people lobbying for more visas are Google, Microsoft, and the Chamber of Commerce, companies that despise populists precisely because they want cheap and compliant labor. You are chasing ghosts instead of naming the real culprit. Corporate America bought both parties to replace citizen engineers with global wage slaves. That is the kind of globalism the establishment loves because it keeps wages low and keeps you blaming random foreign scapegoats instead of the boardrooms writing the checks. The enemy is not \u201cjeets\u201d or \u201cchinks.\u201d It is the corporate class that replaced the American middle class with an imported one and convinced you to argue about Israel while they cash out your future. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 2 points 4 hours ago I didn\u2019t read any of this. permalink parent award report block reply Jaqen 1 points 5 hours ago Regarding the managerial elite: https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/05/new-class-war/ permalink parent award report block reply load 4 more comments...

When they say \"American\" don't have the talent, they mean Whites. Notice colleges and every center of power have been attacking Whites and Whiteness for the last 20 years, yet the only counter in return is to combat antisemitism. permalink parent award report block reply RStroud 3 points 10 hours ago There are plenty of whites, but they don't want to live 5 to a room in a rented apartment that smells like body odor and curry.  Also, being on the West Coast isn't a selling point for Americans anymore.  Finally you've got a mature technology with multiple competitors in the multi trillion dollar market cap range, the rockstar startup age of making millions on blowing smoke and hype is long, long past.  It hasn't been sexy or free money in decades. If it were about Asian talent, there are 125m Japanese and 50m Koreans, and 2/3 of them have college level education.  But they don't come as cheap as Chinese or Indians. Side note, the AI circle jerk feels like Dot Com 2.0 with two suppliers.

Only about 10% of people I've worked with know their ass from a hole in the ground. I think the retarded 90% can only read two syllables into a word. Some of these people came into upper management in the past 5 years. Importing thousands of low wage street shitting sex pests from a sun 80 iq peninsula is not going to help.

None of this happened prior to all our shit being sent overseas. Detroit is a prime example of what Americans can do when there's incentive and possibility. People lose hope and stop giving a shit when there's no possibility to move up in life. Additionally, kids getting shot at every day and starving or living off Cheetos and food stamps don't really have time to learn. Pretty soon, nobody's gonna study STEM or medical, and we'll need foreigners to do all of it.

They lie their way into IT management, and since pretty much anyone can manage IT, then they too can do it.  I say anyone can do IT management because the way you manage IT is you leave them the fuck alone to do their actual, and you keep them OUT OF MEETINGS as much as you can.  You basically read their ticket system emails and make sure they're on task, and you keep the rest of the company from making retard requests of them all day long so they can focus on doing what the higherups are telling you are priorty There I just described in a few sentences the TOTALITY of IT MANAGEMNT.

Additionally, all the hardest shit, core systems, infrastructure, etc. was built long ago by White Americans who could actually speak English.

The only reason they are paying double is so they can get a job in the USA and/or steal American IP. Meanwhile, those colleges use the money they get from foreign students to subsidize their radical communist propaganda programs designed to turn normal American children into mental case tranny school shooters and assassins of prominent conservatives. Trump already had a close call with one of these individuals, but he is clearly a slow learner. The fact is 50% of colleges absolutely need to go bust and their unemployed commie groomer professors need to be banned from ever teaching again. permalink award report block reply rebuildingMyself 1 points 2 hours ago Yes agreed. Between govt guaranteed school loans and foreigners paying 2x tuition, it's allowed these universities to prop up useless departments that churn out brainwashed commies with no valuable skills.

They're literally incapable of seeing 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. order effects on any systems under their purview, which is something that a lot Americans tend to do intuitively, quickly, and more efficiently than even AI does, at least when it comes to hardware and configurations. I'm constantly fixing H1B and off-shored IT admin mistakes on a daily basis at work. Take the installation and configuration of a typical ~300lbs 4U storage system. An H1B will just slap it in the rack and not once think about ensuring proper cable management so they won't cause an outage if they have to replace a part in a node or if they have to add additional storage systems in the future or hot-swap a switch or switch blade. They don't care because the task they were given was \"install that storage system in the rack\". The task never said anything about proper cable management because the person writing up the task thinks that everyone in IT would know to do that automagically. But only the Americans think ahead like that. That's just a small one of the hundreds of fuck-ups I've seen H1Bs and off-shored IT admins do over the years. The worst ones will try to blame me for their own fuck-ups and I don't stand for that shit at all. \"Who installed and configured the system?  That's right - not me.  It was you that did it wrong.

Trump on Position on Visas\nMarch 03, 2016\n\"Megyn Kelly asked about highly-skilled immigration. The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\" permalink award report block reply texas4ever 1 points 11 hours ago H1B is just for cheaper labor.

Elon can be thrown into that mix and there are many others on that cabinet that has that balance which is so hard to find. Too far to the left or too far to the right is not the Goldilock zone and it does not sustain or allow life to thrive. And when your hearts on fire; you must realize...smoke gets in your eyes. I don't care what anybody says I adore Donald J Trump. I am so proud of his courage and his staying power. Monsters Inc is about to go through some incredible changes! Lions will lay down with lambs!

You think the world\u2019s superpower got that way by begging other countries for help? If people don\u2019t have the correct skills then wages for those positions should increase until Americans fill those jobs. Opening up the entire earth to fill a job opening repeated to infinity is lowering the American skill set and lowering American wages and quality of life. Almost every problem this country can be traced back to immigration of both legal and illegal types. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -19 points 13 hours ago Most of these industries haven't been in America since the 1980s.

There is no \u201cZionist punishment campaign\u201d sending Indian or Chinese workers to America. The H-1B system is not run out of Tel Aviv. It is run out of the Department of Labor and Silicon Valley HR departments.

Also, being on the West Coast isn't a selling point for Americans anymore.  Finally you've got a mature technology with multiple competitors in the multi trillion dollar market cap range, the rockstar startup age of making millions on blowing smoke and hype is long, long past.

You look around, and see that the country doesn't have the same people in it that it had when things were pretty good. And you start to notice the strong correlation between things being shitty, and the different people. Then you look at where the different people come from, and realize where they came from is shitty too. Almost like they brought the SHIT with them. Because they CREATED THE SHIT.

The only reason they are paying double is so they can get a job in the USA and/or steal American IP. Meanwhile, those colleges use the money they get from foreign students to subsidize their radical communist propaganda programs designed to turn normal American children into mental case tranny school shooters and assassins of prominent conservatives. Trump already had a close call with one of these individuals, but he is clearly a slow learner. The fact is 50% of colleges absolutely need to go bust and their unemployed commie groomer professors need to be banned from ever teaching again. permalink award report block reply rebuildingMyself 1 points 2 hours ago Yes agreed.

I'm constantly fixing H1B and off-shored IT admin mistakes on a daily basis at work. Take the installation and configuration of a typical ~300lbs 4U storage system. An H1B will just slap it in the rack and not once think about ensuring proper cable management so they won't cause an outage if they have to replace a part in a node or if they have to add additional storage systems in the future or hot-swap a switch or switch blade. They don't care because the task they were given was \"install that storage system in the rack\". The task never said anything about proper cable management because the person writing up the task thinks that everyone in IT would know to do that automagically. But only the Americans think ahead like that. That's just a small one of the hundreds of fuck-ups I've seen H1Bs and off-shored IT admins do over the years. The worst ones will try to blame me for their own fuck-ups and I don't stand for that shit at all. \"Who installed and configured the system?  That's right - not me.  It was you that did it wrong.

Then refocus on the White and other local population and give them all incentives to marry and have kids. permalink parent award report block reply Datamancer 4 points 11 hours ago First we put it to zero and wring out all the shit. Then we recalibrate it for the top 1% of global talent. permalink parent award report block reply Datamancer 6 points 11 hours ago A fucking balance?  Are you high?  It is a boat anchor tied around the neck of the white collar middle class. Fucking balance. permalink parent award report block reply grannylovestrump -3 points 11 hours ago He is like King Solomon praying to God to give him power over the demons that wish to destroy his people and his land. He is a good leader. We stand with our Commander in battle win or lose but I see God is at the helm anyway and no mortal man.

Today's culture is completely different and H-1B's prosper in our current environment. When people don't have the skills needed we need legal immigration, something this women (revoke 19th amendment) doesn't clearly understand along with the stormfags here pushing anti-Trump propaganda. permalink award report block reply joggin_noggin 7 points 11 hours ago Of course H1Bs prosper in this environment with the deck rigged in their favor. permalink parent award report block reply vongregormench 6 points 11 hours ago We don\u2019t need ANY immigration period. You think the world\u2019s superpower got that way by begging other countries for help? If people don\u2019t have the correct skills then wages for those positions should increase until Americans fill those jobs. Opening up the entire earth to fill a job opening repeated to infinity is lowering the American skill set and lowering American wages and quality of life. Almost every problem this country can be traced back to immigration of both legal and illegal types. permalink parent award report block reply\njoggin_noggin 7 points 11 hours ago Of course H1Bs prosper in this environment with the deck rigged in their favor. permalink parent award report block reply\nvongregormench 6 points 11 hours ago We don\u2019t need ANY immigration period.

How many EMs and ETs exit the Navy every fucking month.   You think that cannot train on batteries, power systems,  and simply circuitry?  Same with Air Force and Army. Fucking fuck already.
