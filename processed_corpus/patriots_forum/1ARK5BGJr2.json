Have babies. Go forth and multiply. Your sense of purposeful, orderly time is from Sabbath observance, the Fourth Commandent. The week is not naturally occurring, unlike the month and year. Yes to the Ten Commandments on every institutional wall. You are people of the Bible. You don't know your own names without it.

He always talked about how men need to be in a biblical sense, which is good, but he never talked about how women should be. Men and women are not equal and a woman should never be over a man. God did not design us that way and the bible tells us that it is an errant structure permalink award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 4 points 3 days ago You Sir, are correct! permalink parent award report block reply God-is-good 2 points 2 days ago What you claim Charlie says isn\u2019t in this video at all. Do you have a source? I wonder how Charlie would respond to this comment. Scripture tells the man to sacrifice for his family and wife as if they were own body. The mans priorities are to God, his children, his wife and then himself. Hierarchy is a separate concept and would order things differently. What Charlie meant would depend on what context Charlie made such a statement.
