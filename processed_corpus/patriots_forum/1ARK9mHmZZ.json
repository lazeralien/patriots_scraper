The fact your countersignaling real AF  /  MAGA shows us that you are not serious about our future as a nation. Your disdain for people calling out what's right shows us that you don't really give a shit about our future. To be honest, this is precisely what paid shills would do. You're not going to guilt us into relinquishing real AF / MAGA policies. Trump can fix this if he just acts accordingly and listens.. but since scamela blondi is still at the helm... people are losing hope that he will correct ship.\n17 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Elon Reveals the Real Reason He Walks Away From Trump Read More Ads by Ad.Style MickHigan2 OP 11 points 11 hours ago Laura: \"We have plenty of talented people here!\" Trump: \"No, you don't.

But this is politics. There are always compromises. But what do you think is more important?\ncutting H1b or reshoring manufacturing through tariffs? allowing 600k Chinese students or bringing Universities to heel and stopping mass indoctrination of our children? Mideast military bases or not getting sucked into a land war in Iran or a direct confrontation with Russia in Ukraine? What's more important than mass deportations?\nWhat's more important than a secure border?\nWhat's more important than cutting Fentanyl deaths?\nWhat's more important than stopping crime in our cities? You can disagree with Trump. But when people talk about abandoning Trump then I think that they're not really MAGA. I begin to wonder whether they're shills. permalink award report block reply SpaceWizard 4 points 11 hours ago Also what's going to happen if the Dems win? Digital ID?
