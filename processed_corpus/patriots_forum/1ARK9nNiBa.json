Everyone had one. It was true. Very popular car in the 80s for teens. My boyfriend had an early 70s Buick Skylark. Loved that car more then I liked him. permalink award report block reply DudeThatCame2Sarnath 1 points 6 hours ago Sounds like the guys I grew up with. They were into muscle cars when muscle cars weren't really that cool haha. One guy drove a Plymouth Satellite, but his dream car was (and still is) an Olds 442 convertible. Or maybe a Grand National. He would preach to anybody who would listen that the AMC Javelin was actually a cool car. Me? I drove a VW Rabbit haha. I lacked the perspective at that time to properly appreciate classic American muscle cars.
