(35yrs old) and while \"waiting until we could afford kids\" my 20yr old nephew fathered his third child with a third mother.  We decidd then that we needed children to offset the damage my nephew was doing.  After third miscarriage, her OB said, \"Keep trying.  This is just God's way of sorting out the good eggs\".  Our daughter is now 21, brilliant, 4.0+ in Junior year to become a doctor.  She is KILLIN' it.  She walked on 1st birthday, could sing National Anthem at 18 months, speaks perfect, proper english (never spoke baby talk to her), converses perfectly with other adults, scoffs at peer pressure and is a great driver! (can change a flat, too!).\nRead to your daughter!  Enjoy silly cat videos with her.  Point out lunatics in public so she recognizes them.  Don't ever be vulgar around her, or your wife.  Drop what you're doing and welcome her when she arrives home or even enters a room. Oh, and teach her sign language!

In the words of Hannah when God granted her request for a child 1 Samuel 2:1-2 (KJV) 1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 2 [There is] none holy as the LORD: for [there is] none beside thee: neither [is there] any rock like our God. What a beautiful treasure to be blessed with. May we all continue to thank God daily for the opportunity to be parents. I pray you are able to enjoy your new destiny to its fullest! God continue to bless you all. permalink award report block reply\nGildoom 5 points 5 hours ago Praise God permalink award report block reply\nI_Love_45-70_Gov 5 points 9 hours ago Beautiful, Pede. \ud83d\ude00 permalink award report block reply\nBriankitis 5 points 6 hours ago Tell her to take a baby aspirin a day to help prevent miscarriages due to blood clots.

Those ultrasound pictures are weird. I still have ours tucked away. Hopefully, they haven't \"developed\" more over the years and turned into black paper sheets. Our first was a boy, and I never saw proof of that in the ultrasound images. However, our daughter was instantly identified. My wife and the nurse were like, oh, it's a girl. I struggled at first, then embarrassed, I said. Oh, I see it now. Plain as day, it was as if she had and OF page in the womb. permalink award report block reply MawdT20 OP 3 points 9 hours ago I had a similar experience at the anatomy scan.
