At the turn of the century, the US government was at an impasses as the masses were getting indoctrinated into communism.  To fight that the US government got involved in mortgages to help people take out mortgages to increase ownership and created things like the 30 year mortgage.  Something that someone could take out at 20 and have paid off by 50. By putting out a 50 year mortgage, it would massively increase the banks profits and decrease the workers ability to save. Do better by removing cunts like Blackrock from being able to own single family and multi family homes and watch the prices for homes decrease not increase. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -11 points 4 days ago Keep our borders closed until we house every American living on the streets.

Nobody is expected to stay in their home for 50 years (very few people stay in their home for 30, or even 15 years).  That's not what this is about.  It's essentially an interest-only mortgage, a product which already exists and is chosen by a lot of high-income buyers, in most cases those expecting to stay in the home for 5 years or less.  This proposal would make an effectively interest-only mortgage more widely available to non-wealthy borrowers. It's primarily a way to get in on the inflation benefit, selling the home after living in it for a few years, after inflation (even when very low) has increased the value.  Doesn't matter if the monthly payment is as much (or even a bit more) than the owner would be paying as a renter.  A renter isn't building any equity via inflation.  There's also a tax benefit under longstanding federal tax law, which allows lower income to upper-middle income borrowers to deduct all the mortgage interest from taxable income. permalink award report block reply snoopy3210 7 points 4 days ago It does delay ownership and with large firms like Blackrock buying homes, you just fell for the \u201cyou\u2019ll have nothing and be happy\u201d 50 mortgages also relief pressure on politicians from lowering the home costs.

Now. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora 1 points 4 days ago No, it does not delay ownership, because nobody will actually be holding on to the mortgage for 50 years.  For many people, it would end up accelerating full ownership, because of the inflation and tax benefits, when they sell the home after 5 years, and are able to buy their next home on a 15 year mortgage, rather than the 30 year that they would have needed for the same home, if they hadn't built some equity through inflation on their 50 year mortgaged home. If it enables them to use their available income more profitably in the earliest years of the 50 year loan, they will be better positioned to own a mortgage-free home sooner (though that's not necessarily a goal for many people whose careers are expected to require frequent relocation). permalink parent award report block reply Newhawk237 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply ForceMultiplier 6 points 4 days ago Sometime during Japan's economic decline, they invented 100 year mortgages, because living in a tiny little condo was becoming crazy expensive.

With a 30 year, your're getting good pay down by year 10.  About 27% of the payment is going to principal by then. With a 50 year, only about 8% is.  The savings per month would have gone towards paying down the loan.  So you can save money per month, but it is because you are closer to an interest only loan. If the house appreciates your return is better because you put less in. But you walk with less money. For most people, the forced savings by having the higher monthly payment will end up better. permalink award report block reply TonyTreehouse 1 points 4 days ago I'll also add that by year 30, on a $100k loan at 6.5%, you will have paid $24,600 more in the 360 monthly payments and paid the loan off.  The 50 year loan will still have a $75,600 balance.  The 30 years of compound reduction results in the roughly 3x difference.  That's of the rate is the same.  A 50 year  would likely have a higher rate permalink parent award report block reply LordCommissarYarrick 2 points 4 days ago The government and financial system hate you permalink award report block reply Melchizedek18 1 points 3 days ago A 50-year mortgage is called rent, where your landlord is a bank.

A 50 year mortgage doesn't mean you are forced to pay the mortgage on the house for 50 years. You can sell it and move. Often you can sell it for a higher amount and upgrade to a better home. It allows someone to buy a house with a lower monthly payment. So maybe they couldn't afford the house on a shorter term mortgage maybe they can afford it now. A mortgage on a home is a good thing. Fuck do I really need to explain how the house market and a mortgage work, and why owning a home is a good investment even if you are paying a mortgage.

Trump should do what he promised he would do: rid our country of illegal aliens. This will alleviate the upward pressure on both housing and food, and put him in a stronger position to do what he didn't promise but will have to do anyway: End the Fed. permalink award report block reply\nBlueKentuckyGirl 5 points 4 days ago 50 year mortgage should be illegal like government run student loans \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 permalink award report block reply\nChinchillaCapitalism 4 points 4 days ago The year is 2087.

Nobody is telling people to pay a mortgage for 50 years.  Longer term means lower payment and easier budget and easier to overpay on the principal.  Instead people are renting and getting slowly squeezed out over time because of aggressive rate hikes. permalink award report block reply GoGoGadgetGringo 1 points 4 days ago Exactly.

With a 30 year, your're getting good pay down by year 10.  About 27% of the payment is going to principal by then. With a 50 year, only about 8% is.  The savings per month would have gone towards paying down the loan.  So you can save money per month, but it is because you are closer to an interest only loan. If the house appreciates your return is better because you put less in. But you walk with less money. For most people, the forced savings by having the higher monthly payment will end up better. permalink award report block reply TonyTreehouse 1 points 4 days ago I'll also add that by year 30, on a $100k loan at 6.5%, you will have paid $24,600 more in the 360 monthly payments and paid the loan off.  The 50 year loan will still have a $75,600 balance.  The 30 years of compound reduction results in the roughly 3x difference.  That's of the rate is the same.  A 50 year  would likely have a higher rate permalink parent award report block reply\nTonyTreehouse 1 points 4 days ago I'll also add that by year 30, on a $100k loan at 6.5%, you will have paid $24,600 more in the 360 monthly payments and paid the loan off.

A 50 year mortgage doesn't mean you are forced to pay the mortgage on the house for 50 years. You can sell it and move. Often you can sell it for a higher amount and upgrade to a better home. It allows someone to buy a house with a lower monthly payment. So maybe they couldn't afford the house on a shorter term mortgage maybe they can afford it now. A mortgage on a home is a good thing. Fuck do I really need to explain how the house market and a mortgage work, and why owning a home is a good investment even if you are paying a mortgage. I swear to god you faggots are dumb. permalink award report block reply Crucible 10 points 4 days ago You won't have any equity to flip because the loan is front loaded.
