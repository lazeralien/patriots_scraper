That's how most of that outsoycing works. American, European, Korean, and/or Japanese design it all, bring in competent foreigners to build it  and occasionally maintain it, while the locals do the daily grunt work. Many companies went so far as to tear down their US and Canada factories, and move that tooling over to India, China, or SEA countries. permalink parent award report block reply DaayTerkErJerbs 2 points 1 day ago Bro india makes a lot of shit by hand cuz they'll work for 1.00 an hour.

Chinese tea says you should pour boiling water on it and then immediately pour it off into the drain to wash off the poison. I guess I should be glad they are honest about it and warn you though. permalink parent award report block reply HiddenDekuScrub 3 points 1 day ago You folks are probably going to be fine with Royal Dansk, Pepperidge Farm, Kelsen, Walkers, etc... Hunting around on Amazon there's a few brands that hail from Portugal. It's the overly generic brands you have to watch for. \"Heaveny Bites\" is made in India. There's also a \"Royal Delight\" brand that appears to be copycatting Royal Dansk that I couldn't find a label for. (Sounds suspicious.) Wal Mart's store brand could either be Portugal or India, so read the tin, but I don't know why you'd want to gift people Wal Mart store brands anyway. \"Oriental Trading Company\" is most likely made in China. To be fair, I imagine any facility that produces food for American use is most likely fine and that mass-produced cookies are coming out of a machine, but I also get people aren't thrilled with India right now. permalink parent award report block reply Rey_ 3 points 1 day ago This is no joke, I visited Indian on tour and loved it (on tour). Wife and I took day tour into Dharavi slum and saw open door basement bakery where men kneaded dough with their special socked feet for the famous cookies sold; two feet from the entrance I stood over sewage trickling down the center of our path with rats darting about.

There's also a \"Royal Delight\" brand that appears to be copycatting Royal Dansk that I couldn't find a label for. (Sounds suspicious.) Wal Mart's store brand could either be Portugal or India, so read the tin, but I don't know why you'd want to gift people Wal Mart store brands anyway. \"Oriental Trading Company\" is most likely made in China. To be fair, I imagine any facility that produces food for American use is most likely fine and that mass-produced cookies are coming out of a machine, but I also get people aren't thrilled with India right now. permalink parent award report block reply\nHerpawinski OP 16 points 1 day ago Like I said, look on the bottom of the tin. \"Royal Dansk\" are made in Denmark, but if they're called something else, look on the bottom of the tin to see where they're made to be sure. permalink parent award report block reply\norange_popcicle 6 points 1 day ago Check the label.
