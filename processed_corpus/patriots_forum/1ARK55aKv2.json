They are all on the same team. People need to realize this fake WWE scripted bullshit political theater is there to distract and give one the impression that they have a side in the game. The only side we need to focus on is MAGA AF versus commies and traitors to all Americans. All of those faggots were in on the open border invasion and now are behind the replacing Americans with Visa abusing Jeets and other foreigners. They are enemies and we should treat every last one of those 535 pricks that way. MAGA AF agendas are not being codified into law and these maggots are looking for new ways to fuck us daily. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 14 points 5 days ago And people also need to realize that AIPAC backs this Uniparty faction of the GOP against any attempt at reform, and that jews formed and lead the vast majority of communist uprisings over the last 100 years. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

They both exist to shift taxpayer money to themselves and their friends and so are allied in wanting the government to only ever get larger.  But at the same time, for any individual seat each party would prefer one of their own to hold that seat all other things being equal.  The RINOs have an additional constraint that it is preferable for the entire R party to have a minority position so that they can more easily explain to their small government desiring voters why the government size increased during their term. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT 4 points 5 days ago Therein lies the problem.

The person you want in your government is the person who doesn't really want to be there.  For any competent and high ability person, the only way to get any value out of choosing to be a politician is through corruption.  Those people would make more money in other ways.  So you get mostly corrupt clever people and honest low talent people.  And the honest low talent people tend not to survive very long, leading to the corrupt taking over.  We would do a lot better by picking people randomly from the voter rolls to be the representatives. permalink parent award report block reply MastaJoda 2 points 5 days ago \u261dIm here.

Will the brambles choke out our blessings again? Judges 9:8-15 (KJV) 8 The trees went forth [on a time] to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. 9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 10 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? 12 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 14 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, [then] come [and] put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. permalink parent award report block reply EgregiousPhilbin 7 points 5 days ago Right.

It\u2019s inherently anti-democratic and needs to go. permalink award report block reply sovereign 16 points 5 days ago Right now with how the democrats are acting in bad faith over this, I'm now becoming convinced that nuking the filibuster may indeed be the correct move. permalink parent award report block reply MAGA_MyPillow 20 points 5 days ago I believe that will be the Play. The dems feel emboldened after Tuesdays results and are going to increase their demands. The GOP cannot give in or its the end of Trump and the GOP. The only play left is to end the filibuster and get the checks in everyones hand before thanksgiving. If the media says its the GOP's fault for the shutdown. well lets end the filibuster and let the GOP open everything back up. permalink parent award report block reply lixa 1 points 5 days ago And they must pass election integrity.

The demons are gonna do this anyways eventually and they\u2019ll have the presidency when they do. permalink parent award report block reply HKFan 12 points 5 days ago I'm all for nuking the filibuster if . . . it's followed up by a slew of legislation which renders the democrat party null and void as a national party.  And you know the GOP doesn't have the stomach for that unfortunately, although it needs to be done. Until then tbh we need the protections it offers, when they took power in 2020 they IMMEDIATELY started floating forever power moves like DC statehood and getting rid of the electoral college. Keep the government shutdown if it comes to it.  Fuck it permalink parent award report block reply Im_RickSteves_bitch 21 points 5 days ago Thune is playing for the other team, and it should have been obvious to anyone paying attention well before now. permalink award report block reply AmannamedRJ 9 points 5 days ago Dude it was obvious in December during the leadership election. The GOP doesn't like that Trump and MAGA took it over. They're throwing the fight as hard as they can. They are that corrupt. Pay serious attention now.

This could kick off more states to buy in to the Article V convention of the states because I could see the states wanting the filibuster to be an amendment. If we could have a temporary stop on the filibuster, then we win.  Plain and simple.  If we don't, we know the Democrats will do it and we will lose. This is the play... this is it. permalink award report block reply PM_ME_UR_MAGIC_CARDS 1 points 5 days ago well shit when you put it like that permalink parent award report block reply Freeth3usa 1 points 5 days ago How exactly will congress get voter id or stop mail in voting? You need a constitutional amendment for that. permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 1 points 4 days ago I specifically mention kicking off article V convention of the states which is used to amend the constitution. There is some ability for the federal government to provide guidelines for federal elections.  For example, a state can't say \"the first person to get 500 votes wins\" even though it's up to the legislators to control the election. permalink parent award report block reply infeststation 1 points 5 days ago Why? permalink parent award report block reply Fren20 1 points 5 days ago Please explain the amendment permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 1 points 4 days ago I didn't bring up any amendment.  I brought up article V, convention of states.  Article V is the part of the Constitution that explains now to amend the constitution.  If 2/3 (34) of the states call for a convention, then there will be a gathering of the states to propose new amendments, all without going through congress. It requires 75% (38) of the states approval to ratify the state proposed amendment. It's never been done, but there are currently 19 states that have approved it, many that have legislation passed in one chamber, and many that have active legislation.  It looks like the only states that want to avoid it are the very blue states. https://conventionofstates.com/states-that-have-passed-the-convention-of-states-article-v-application permalink parent award report block reply CanadianMeathead 19 points 5 days ago Watch those who vote against this. permalink award report block reply Simple_Doot 7 points 5 days ago I really dont think its crazy to have some apprehension about abolishing the filibuster.  But I also believe there is some unbelievable event just over the horizon that will lead to a complete reordering of society globally.  Trump will be the last president so if there is some inevitable insane event coming then it makes sense that we would nuke the filibuster and not give a shit about spending because it simply will not matter in a few years. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 4 points 5 days ago I can't say I'm a fan of nuking the filibuster, but we almost saw it happen while Biden was president. Sinema and Manchin were the only two who kept it from happening, and Sinema was harassed on more than one occasion over it. I'm interested in seeing what the GOP does if Dems continue to refuse to open the government, since they probably believe the country blames Trump for it after seeing how the elections went on Tuesday. At the same time, I know there are several in the GOP that will be a hard no on nuking the filibuster, and if I remember correctly, Cruz said they don't have the votes to do it. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 1 points 5 days ago Would it help if I told you that dems implemented the filibuster rule in its current form and that the current implementation is younger than me? permalink parent award report block reply Fren20 1 points 5 days ago Hell yeah spread the word,I truly think trump will be our last president at all need to make plans. permalink parent award report block reply _fidelio 1 points 5 days ago Interesting.. Why do you think Trump will be the last president? permalink parent award report block reply Simple_Doot 1 points 4 days ago Not much in way if hard evidence.  But there are so many things coming to a head, so many lies about our past, Revelations' seeming fulfillment, the unsustainable trajectory of geopolitics and our own government hustle not caring about anything almost as if someone knows we are about to drive off a cliff so just let go of the wheel.  If we are holding Trump to MAGA standards of 2016-2024 he has absolutely failed, gone completely off course.  He is pursuing some other agenda that is completely hidden from us.  I think its because he is an agent of something that has been here for thousands of years and not the American people.  Its a bat shit crazy idea but Im certain of it. permalink parent award report block reply trumpORbust 2 points 5 days ago All of them permalink parent award report block reply Deplorable_in_PA 14 points 5 days ago I really, truly dislike the idea of nuking the filibuster.  It basically means whoever has a slim majority in congress can pass whatever they want and all the other side can do is sit down, STFU, and tweet about it.  It's basically majority rule and that flies in the face of us being a republic vs a democracy. That said, you know the second the dems get a majority that will be the first thing they do.  If we don't nuke the filibuster we lose perhaps our only window to pass the MAGA agenda. permalink award report block reply TrumpAndGodWin 5 points 5 days ago Don't forget the dems wanting to pack the supreme court. permalink parent award report block reply Freeth3usa 1 points 5 days ago Meh they\u2019ll never pack the court. It just means the next administration would likely pack it too. Then continue until we have 1000\u2019s of judges. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 1 points 5 days ago All next administrations will be Dem if they can pack the SC. Which they're likely to get to do anyway at some point. The only reason Dems don't take a step that increases their power is because they think there's already an easier or less controversial way to do it. That has been election fraud but it's failed them twice so get ready for worse. Currently, it seems to be 'rogue' judges. permalink parent award report block reply LUXURY_USERNAME 2 points 5 days ago Yeah but how will they get the majority again if we have voter ID and same day voting, one day elections, no mail-in, citizens only, etc permalink parent award report block reply Fren20 1 points 5 days ago Well what do you suggest permalink parent award report block reply infeststation 1 points 5 days ago After some turbulence, the people will force politicians to come back to the center. permalink parent award report block reply Albo22 8 points 5 days ago Democrats will nuke  it as soon as they come to power permalink award report block reply Tmntnyc 4 points 5 days ago They didn't nuke it last time they were in power, why would they? permalink parent award report block reply BasedLaugh 4 points 5 days ago Yeah they did. Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema were the two Senators that voted no and stalled their attempt to nuke the filibuster to pass the Voting Rights Act in 2022. They will definitely try to do it again. permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -1 points 5 days ago Attempting to bypass it for one single vote is not nuking the filibuster.

And need fear and coercion to get it done. We're the last ones to actually kill it for something, Supreme Court confirmations. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 1 points 5 days ago Yeah but the dems had done it not too long before for presidential nominations. Turtle Mitch famously warned them they'd come to regret it. The filibuster for most nominations was last removed by Senate Democrats in 2013, when then-Majority Leader Harry Reid led the effort to eliminate the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees (except Supreme Court nominees) through the \"nuclear option\".\nThis change allowed a simple majority to confirm these nominees instead of requiring 60 votes. *Note: I also asked it about supreme court nominations and it did mention the Rs in 2017 (as you have said) so I'll stipulate that it has made an error in its assessment there but that the event still occurred when it did. At this point, it's only there until anyone has the will to remove it and it would be foolish to concede that to people who want us all dead. permalink parent award report block reply Mooksayshigh 1 points 5 days ago They tried to kill him, they are killing us.

However I do worry about the rino's in our midst. I don't believe that's enough that we shouldn't do this.

State of Michigan had a Republican FULL Trifecta in the State Capitol in 2014.  With that power they did actually very little except for making Michigan a Right to Work State - which was a big deal. Then - the Democrats somehow won their own FULL Trifecta to control the State in 2022 - they INSTANTLY PASSED ALL KINDS OF TOTAL SHIT - removed Right to  Work instantly - increased taxes - increased spending - removed Parental Rights - Made Abortion a basic religion - forced a ton of 'clean energy' requirements on utilities that 'drive up energy costs' - and virtually destroyed voting security. And people have been moving out of state ever since. Be careful what you wish for.  I would recommend just WINNING 60 REPUBLICAN SENATE SEATS.... so the Filibuster would not be important. permalink award report block reply fazaman 2 points 5 days ago But they don't want to do those things.

When Ds are in majority, the only thing stopping them from implementing complete communism in 2 years is the filibuster.  When Rs are in the minority they dither around and wait until the Ds are again in the majority.  Even talking about ending the filibuster is gonna result in more future communism, because the Ds will use this as an argument for ending it when THEY are back in charge. permalink award report block reply bluewhiteandred 1 points 5 days ago Another comment and question Can they nuke filibuster, do what they want, and pass some ban of filibuster?

I voted for Trump to, in the words of Obama, kick ass and take names. We were supposed to have a  DOJ that was elbows deep in investigating and prosecuting election fraud. We watched as the Dems stole seat after seat in 2024 with mail-in ballots and scam overseas ballots they \"counted\" for weeks and months after the election. The house isn't gonna do shit. If the people involved in the prior cases were arrested and prosecuted, we wouldn't need Congress in the first place, all the perps would be locked up, and any remaining would think twice about breaking the law. I voted for Trump to restore accountability, not beg and plead for help that will never come. permalink award report block reply Chango3 1 points 5 days ago Remember, these people campaigned for career goals.

Legal way to get ahead on things? permalink parent award report block reply dataonly 3 points 5 days ago Legal way to get ahead on things? Don't think so.  It's a quick fix w/ catastrophic future consequences. I had posted this as a reply in another thread: Dems could have ended filibuster under Biden, but there were 2 of 51 that would not do so. Added:  So, it only 2 reasonable Senators, Manchin and Sinema, to keep the entire process from going off the rails.  That's a good thing. Filibuster is a valid and necessary Senate tool, that serves both parties and the American people well. It is a guard rail against extreme. W/o the filibuster Dems could have added PR and DC as a state and stacked SCOTUS. Filibuster is necssary. However, what they have now is virtual filibuster. All they have to do is declare it. Forcing them to follow the traditional filibuster rule (and hold the floor) is the answer. permalink parent award report block reply bluewhiteandred 1 points 5 days ago Yeah but isn't this like executive orders which are an abuse of the system as it was designed, yet Trump has been churning them out (following precendet of past presidents doing likewise?) permalink parent award report block reply FlyCatcher94 1 points 5 days ago That will guarantee they won\u2019t do shit. permalink award report block reply ShotgunParade69x 1 points 5 days ago Call your senate leaders and raise hell . permalink award report block reply gaijin_ronin 1 points 5 days ago Secure our gun rights plainly for retards to understand. permalink award report block reply Awakened 1 points 5 days ago When the democrats get power again, and they will, one of the first thing they will do is nuke the filibuster whether Trump does it now or not. permalink award report block reply Tmntnyc 2 points 5 days ago Why didn't they nuke it in 2021 when they had control over both hours and senate and Biden was in charge? Why would they nuke it now but not before? permalink parent award report block reply Build_Back_Bankrupt 1 points 5 days ago They didn't need to because the Biden maladministration was above the law.  Look at all the dereliction of duty he and his cronies participated in. They were too busy and empowered to break the laws rather than pass them. Nuking it back then would just expend political capital and would put cracks in their BS facade and I don't think people would stand for them nuking it and then passing obviously unconstitutional laws in order to benefit their criminality and corruption. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 1 points 5 days ago Because they also like complaining about the other side while doing nothing about the status quo.

Turtle Mitch famously warned them they'd come to regret it. The filibuster for most nominations was last removed by Senate Democrats in 2013, when then-Majority Leader Harry Reid led the effort to eliminate the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees (except Supreme Court nominees) through the \"nuclear option\".\nThis change allowed a simple majority to confirm these nominees instead of requiring 60 votes. *Note: I also asked it about supreme court nominations and it did mention the Rs in 2017 (as you have said) so I'll stipulate that it has made an error in its assessment there but that the event still occurred when it did.

It's a quick fix w/ catastrophic future consequences. I had posted this as a reply in another thread: Dems could have ended filibuster under Biden, but there were 2 of 51 that would not do so. Added:  So, it only 2 reasonable Senators, Manchin and Sinema, to keep the entire process from going off the rails.  That's a good thing. Filibuster is a valid and necessary Senate tool, that serves both parties and the American people well. It is a guard rail against extreme. W/o the filibuster Dems could have added PR and DC as a state and stacked SCOTUS. Filibuster is necssary. However, what they have now is virtual filibuster. All they have to do is declare it. Forcing them to follow the traditional filibuster rule (and hold the floor) is the answer. permalink parent award report block reply bluewhiteandred 1 points 5 days ago Yeah but isn't this like executive orders which are an abuse of the system as it was designed, yet Trump has been churning them out (following precendet of past presidents doing likewise?) permalink parent award report block reply\ndataonly 2 points 5 days ago Huge downside.

I laid it all out here-> https://patriots.win/p/1ARK55cGjJ/keep-the-senate-filibuster-in-pl/c permalink parent award report block reply bluewhiteandred 1 points 5 days ago Thanks pede, but I guess we know the other side doesn't play by the rules so it seems like we shouldn't either? Legal way to get ahead on things? permalink parent award report block reply dataonly 3 points 5 days ago Legal way to get ahead on things? Don't think so.  It's a quick fix w/ catastrophic future consequences. I had posted this as a reply in another thread: Dems could have ended filibuster under Biden, but there were 2 of 51 that would not do so. Added:  So, it only 2 reasonable Senators, Manchin and Sinema, to keep the entire process from going off the rails.  That's a good thing. Filibuster is a valid and necessary Senate tool, that serves both parties and the American people well. It is a guard rail against extreme. W/o the filibuster Dems could have added PR and DC as a state and stacked SCOTUS. Filibuster is necssary. However, what they have now is virtual filibuster. All they have to do is declare it.

Why would they nuke it now but not before? permalink parent award report block reply Build_Back_Bankrupt 1 points 5 days ago They didn't need to because the Biden maladministration was above the law.  Look at all the dereliction of duty he and his cronies participated in. They were too busy and empowered to break the laws rather than pass them. Nuking it back then would just expend political capital and would put cracks in their BS facade and I don't think people would stand for them nuking it and then passing obviously unconstitutional laws in order to benefit their criminality and corruption. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 1 points 5 days ago Because they also like complaining about the other side while doing nothing about the status quo.
