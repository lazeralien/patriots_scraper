Updoot! You know how there's all those job listings that seem to be a black void and people apply and never hear back? For how there will be job listings for like entry-level jobs requiring 50 years of experience in a program that only existed for 10? Or non-entry level jobs but paying entry level wages? That's because legally these companies cannot hire H1B unless they first opened it up to Americans.. so they create these BS job listings withoutrageous qualifications that nobody could meet or that the few people who can meet that aren't going to work for such little money and then when predictably no Americans apply and know Americans could meet the qualifications they then go out and hire the Indian workers for pennies on the dollar like they wanted to in the first place permalink parent award report block reply CS_McFisticuffs_III 35 points 5 days ago Need to make H1B so expensive to obtain and retain that it makes no sense to hire one unless there is literally nobody in the country capable of doing the job. permalink parent award report block reply Vorticity1 14 points 5 days ago Exactly. They take away from an American. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... mohel 8 points 5 days ago A lot of companies hiring H1Bs pay no taxes as they make no profits and exit via inflated IPOs/acquisitions. Had RINOs decided to tax them on their H1B employees we could have a nice conversation. Too bad RINOs are too dumb for such moves. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Aquamine-Amarine 13 points 5 days ago This is a huge problem. The only solution is to make it extremely expensive to hire someone that isn't an American. Fine the fuck out of that company for every H1B they have. Make them realize it's cheaper to hire the American. They only learn if you hurt them financially. permalink parent award report block reply negative_entropy 5 points 5 days ago one of the worst things Trump did was to take away the Section174A R&D tax exemption for hiring domestically (part of the 2017 tax bill), it was taken away cuz companies got tax cuts, but removing the special domestic tax exemption caused it to be even cheaper to hire foreigners. it was only restored as part of the BBB in July. permalink parent award report block reply PiratePatriotParrot OP 11 points 5 days ago Yup, no why idiots are down voting those truths permalink parent award report block reply Jmricht 3 points 5 days ago Prime Therapeutics. permalink parent award report block reply Shitsbrokeyo 3 points 5 days ago There was a scattergraph on here yesterday.

Depending on the companies, there could be 175,000 cases. Though something tells me they will be looking the other way for Amazon or other major offenders if they donated money to his campaign. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 11 points 5 days ago It\u2019s companies.

H1B\u2019s are legal to use. It\u2019s stupid. But I\u2019m just interested to find out what grounds this literal who is claiming were investigating them on. permalink parent award report block reply TheGamerToTheRight 6 points 5 days ago H1B is legal, but they have to follow specific rules. They can't just replace an American with a foreigner. They do lots of tricks to follow the letter, but not intention, of the law, such as advertising in local newspapers and then saying no qualified Americans exist when no one applies. Or requiring people to fax their resume to the immigration team if they find the hidden job board the job was posted on. H1B is a scam, and companies are engaging in borderline, if not actual, illegal practices to obtain the cut-rate foreigners. Why should Amazon be getting 10s of thousands of H1Bs, while laying off 30k Americans? permalink parent award report block reply HoganT 0 points 5 days ago Why should Amazon be getting 10s of thousands of H1Bs, while laying off 30k Americans? I don\u2019t disagree. I\u2019m just stating what you tacitly admitted in your reply here. It\u2019s not illegal. If violating the spirit of a law, but not the letter, gets you in trouble, our entire corporate structure is in trouble. You\u2019ll notice it is not, however. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... nemonster 2 points 5 days ago Need to hire more gvnmt people permalink parent award report block reply bananaguard62 2 points 5 days ago It started with call centers.

Hire these Americans as remote workers if you have to permalink parent award report block reply HelluvaEngineer 19 points 5 days ago Most people have no idea how bad it is.  I recently posted a job listing for an entry-level position and got 25 resumes in 2 hours.  Many applicants had 15-20 years of experience.  They have no work.  No one will hire a white person. There were also many grads with masters degrees in tech that are now working at places like tire shops as managers.  I felt really bad emailing one of those grads today and telling him that normally we would hire him but we have overqualified people competing at the same rate. permalink parent award report block reply PiratePatriotParrot OP 11 points 5 days ago 230 applications this year, 560 in 2023 permalink parent award report block reply Spicy_cat 10 points 5 days ago Any corporate creature that pushes DEI should be punished severely.

In the same way, any immigration policy change that would reverse the actions of a democrat will be overruled.

In July they laid off 9k American employees and immediately filed for nearly 14k H1bs. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal -2 points 5 days ago You just reversed your numbers. If you go and review it, the 13k layoffs included H1Bs and were in an entirely different part of the company from where the hiring was. Additionally a company can't directly \"hire H1Bs.\" They post jobs and if no americans apply they can consider H1Bs. Microsoft only has 5,000 H1B approvals in total in 2025.  The numbers you are posting are not numerically possible. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

The break room was like New Delhi. Nobody even bothered speaking English anymore. That was after 12 years at that company. Luckily with all the extra covid unemployment money I was able to sit on my ass until crypto took off in such a way that I was able to retire early and move out to the country.

They're the vanguard of this. If they go after 175 easy to beat little guys it will accomplish nothing. Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Intel, Facebook, Google, Walmart, American Airlines, Bank of America have all got to be in that list and they've got to be prioritized. Same with any and all major financial funds, Black Rock, Goldman Sachs, State Street. If those firms aren't being investigated and their transgressions fully prosecuted, this is a psyop to make it look like somethings happening. The small firms are just riding the big firms' coat tails. We can keep going down the list and get them all, but the most important are the big guys. We can't go up the list and win.

In July they laid off 9k American employees and immediately filed for nearly 14k H1bs. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal -2 points 5 days ago You just reversed your numbers. If you go and review it, the 13k layoffs included H1Bs and were in an entirely different part of the company from where the hiring was. Additionally a company can't directly \"hire H1Bs.\" They post jobs and if no americans apply they can consider H1Bs. Microsoft only has 5,000 H1B approvals in total in 2025.  The numbers you are posting are not numerically possible. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...\nSanityGumby 6 points 5 days ago It literally did happen. Repeatedly.

The break room was like New Delhi. Nobody even bothered speaking English anymore. That was after 12 years at that company. Luckily with all the extra covid unemployment money I was able to sit on my ass until crypto took off in such a way that I was able to retire early and move out to the country. Sold my house to some Pakistani H-1Bs at the top of the market.

They're the vanguard of this. If they go after 175 easy to beat little guys it will accomplish nothing. Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Intel, Facebook, Google, Walmart, American Airlines, Bank of America have all got to be in that list and they've got to be prioritized. Same with any and all major financial funds, Black Rock, Goldman Sachs, State Street. If those firms aren't being investigated and their transgressions fully prosecuted, this is a psyop to make it look like somethings happening. The small firms are just riding the big firms' coat tails. We can keep going down the list and get them all, but the most important are the big guys. We can't go up the list and win. We have to start big and take out the ones that are providing the infrastructural support for it all. I admit that I include American Airlines and Bank of America not due to their influence, but their hypocrisy. They've got to be call out and renamed H1B airlines and bank of H1B for truth in advertising. permalink award report block reply\nbonedancr 1 points 5 days ago Wish there was a tip/hotline Americans could call or email. permalink award report block reply\nMajJamesMcFarlane 1 points 5 days ago Wow. \"Investigations?\" I can't wait to hear about zero penalties or arrests after the investigations are concluded permalink award report block reply\nflashersenpai 1 points 5 days ago Sugar shill is pinned again with no sources Nice! permalink award report block reply\nJoinTheDiscussion 1 points 5 days ago no investigations into 2020/22/24 voting fraud though... this wont mean SHIT if the democrats win 26/28!!! permalink award report block reply\nPillarOfWisdom 1 points 5 days ago That'll make a dent. permalink award report block reply\nMudDog 1 points 5 days ago we investigated ourselves and we found nothing permalink award report block reply\nYeti2 1 points 5 days ago Good.
