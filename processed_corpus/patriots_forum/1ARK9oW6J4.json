H-1B employers can reap significant savings by selecting one of the two lowest wage levels instead of the Level 3 wage (the median, or 50th-percentile, wage) or the Level 4 wage (above the median, at the 67th percentile). Not surprisingly, three-fifths of all H-1B jobs were certified at the two lowest prevailing wage levels in 2019. In fiscal 2019, a total of 60% of H-1B positions certified by DOL had been assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation: 14% were at H-1B Level 1 (the 17th percentile) and 46% were at H-1B Level 2 (34th percentile).

For a second there I thought it was permanent. But wait.. can't they \"train\" us dumb Americans over zoom? We are at least that smart, to figure out how to set up a zoom meeting. Then they never have to come here!! permalink award report block reply berserkerbarrage 1 points 28 minutes ago Except he never said that Americans were dumb, he said that we are lacking American talent in certain industries, that they \"have to learn\" and that you can't just take people off the unemployment line and have them start building missiles and batteries, all of which is true. permalink parent award report block reply SnowSnake 1 points 24 minutes ago I didn't say he said we were dumb.

What a joke. permalink award report block reply TheJakeFroggy 1 points 14 minutes ago My problem with this is, why can't Americans be trained by other Americans? Like, okay with you want to temporarily bring in foreign workers to train Americans and then send them back, but I feel like that's not really even needed in the first place. Why can't Americans be trained at home rather than needing foreign help? permalink award report block reply GhostOfTheRepublic 1 points 10 minutes ago that's fking rich, bring in foreigners that Americans trained to now train Americans?
