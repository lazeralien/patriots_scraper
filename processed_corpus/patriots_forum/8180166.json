Ashli Babbit was murdered by that Sgt of Arms that's got his hand on that faggot Micheal Fanone in the pic, Rosanne Boyland was beaten to death by a female metro pd officer whose name escapes me, then there were two men who had heart attacks and died after being hit and sprayed.  There might be more but those were the ones we found in the body camera and surveillance footage we were given as part of our brady rights. permalink award report block reply scottcaver1 57 points 2 days ago All correct, but that isnt the offocer that killed Babbit.

Went to google, first result is some gay CBS news article from 2021 that says she \u201csuffered a medical emergency.\u201d Went to Twitter and found the video of her being clubbed in the head as she lay faced down.

CEOs and powerful people often feel it is a relief to be totally submissive.  As for women forced by society to play a more masculine role eg. \"Girl Boss.... corner office... cut throat shark etc\" even professional female dommes (and I was a fixture in that world for years) don't actually like their subs and slaves. I mean they won't say it obviously it's their money - but I've had close relationships with many and 100% them are at least \"switchy\"...  Anyway who knows. She is publicly humiliating him often saying things like \"i don't know I often feel like a traitor dating a white man and considered if I should\"  --- whoooo boy I'd be a fucking ghost that night if a woman  said something  like that to me - on camera- for the world.

Those responsible have yet to be held to account and efforts to undo the damage have been stymied by that same Uniparty and their Deep State operatives still carrying out their mission to destroy our Constitutional Republic. permalink parent award report block reply N0rds 4 points 2 days ago You think 9-11 didn't have government coup type meddling? The government 100% had a hand in those towers coming down. So they could hide the missing trillions, push the patriot act bullshit, and start to enact the globalism bullshit we see now. permalink parent award report block reply Skogin 1 points 2 days ago Our fren said J6 was worse government meddling. Although this may not have been obvious during the media onslaught, it is becoming inescapable: 9/11 scapegoated foreigners to destroy their lives, J6 smeared the majority of Americans to directly destroy our lives. permalink parent award report block reply punkalicious 6 points 2 days ago IT WAS WORSE THAN 10X THE HALL OF COSTS.

She has WAY more important things to do than fight for the American people.... permalink parent award report block reply airborne3502 13 points 2 days ago Yes, senators had objections to the election results. All of this was to table those objections so that later on Mike Pence could decide not to send the disputed electors back to the states for another look. \"Since there are no objections.\" Yeah, because they were tabled due to the events of January 6th. That was the end game. Pence was proud of his role in certifying the stolen election and gave Nancy Pelosi an elbow bump. permalink award report block reply FatigueIsReal 2 points 2 days ago I'll add.  More objections than any other election in history. permalink parent award report block reply War_Hamster 12 points 2 days ago This is an accurate summary, but what's missing is how Nancy Pelosi reconvened Congress under special rules that didn't allow for challenging the electors. I'm sure that was just a coincidence.... permalink award report block reply brutustyberius 2 points 2 days ago Or the J6 committee she illegally appointed without Republican selected representation (Nancy appointed Liz and Kitlinger). permalink parent award report block reply War_Hamster 1 points 2 days ago Agreed that it was an illegal committee, but the absence of an honest Republican (if one exists) allowed the J6 committee to manufacture and destroy evidence with no oversight.

There was a conspiracy but most of them were in the dark. I saw (posted here) video of an undercover telling a guard in the capital that \"friendlies\" would have colored wristbands (any color) and striped decals on their guns. On their guns. A short time later Ashley Babbit was shot by member of a security detail. The killer's hand is seen in the video. He has a bunch of colored wristbands (weird for a security guard) and his gun has a striped decal on it, showing that he's a \"friendly\". But he's security and in a suit. Why the hell would he need to signify to anyone that he's a \"friendly\"? He wouldn't, unless \"friendly\" doesn't mean undercover police, but something else. permalink award report block reply Prof_Smith 5 points 2 days ago Scum.

All of this was to table those objections so that later on Mike Pence could decide not to send the disputed electors back to the states for another look. \"Since there are no objections.\" Yeah, because they were tabled due to the events of January 6th. That was the end game. Pence was proud of his role in certifying the stolen election and gave Nancy Pelosi an elbow bump. permalink award report block reply FatigueIsReal 2 points 2 days ago I'll add.

There was a conspiracy but most of them were in the dark. I saw (posted here) video of an undercover telling a guard in the capital that \"friendlies\" would have colored wristbands (any color) and striped decals on their guns. On their guns. A short time later Ashley Babbit was shot by member of a security detail. The killer's hand is seen in the video. He has a bunch of colored wristbands (weird for a security guard) and his gun has a striped decal on it, showing that he's a \"friendly\". But he's security and in a suit. Why the hell would he need to signify to anyone that he's a \"friendly\"? He wouldn't, unless \"friendly\" doesn't mean undercover police, but something else. permalink award report block reply\nProf_Smith 5 points 2 days ago Scum.
