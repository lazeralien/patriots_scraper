Everyone except 'white' people wants to hire only 'their own kind' permalink parent award report block reply BenDoverAssho 18 points 10 hours ago The Kalergi Plan is working. White replacement is a real phenomenon. The solution: 1- Our borders need to be shut, 2- legal immigration needs to be greatly reduced and limited to White Western people only, and 3- mass deportations of illegal foreigners need to be ramped up a hundred fold. Currently, I'm not sure that any of this is happening. permalink award report block reply someguy7738 14 points 10 hours ago And White people need to entirely eschew birth control and have as many children as possible. permalink parent award report block reply greatpumpkin 7 points 6 hours ago That'll never happen unless all divorce laws (& associated drek) going back 106 years are voided. permalink parent award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 2 points 4 hours ago #1 is def happening. The borders are shut. No one is being \"released\" because no one is coming in, so don't be confused by the fed lingo. #2 is well underway. We've revoked TPS, or temp status, and are revoking and even denaturalizing criminals and anti-American chaos agents organizing professional unrest and violence. I've seen this myself in Philly. #3 as for mass deportations, it's ramping up every day. Every day new ICE/CBP come online to process the detainees who need to go back home, and as you can see, the turnover in places like Alligator Alcatraz is vast. But we really are just starting. 11 months into the new Trump 2.0, we're gearing up for the next improved year of processing and deportations. Dems are losing their minds, which is a great metric to go by when gauging effectiveness. Their illegal voters are self-deporting, which is the most pressing problem for them, if I overhear Dems correctly. permalink parent award report block reply BenDoverAssho 2 points 4 hours ago This is a wonderful thing!

He loved 0bama and he used to mock the people in Minneapolis who were \"having a hard time\" with all the Somalis being imported.
