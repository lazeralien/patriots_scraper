HaloGrow BeauHD 76 points 2 days ago They aren't going after him for raping little boys, so I don't see what the big deal is! permalink award report block reply bill_in_texas 37 points 2 days ago I doubt there are any living victims to testify against him.  Didn't Ed Buck finally get put away for killing one of his victims? permalink parent award report block reply HunterBidensPC 17 points 2 days ago Is an Anthony Bourdain dead because of him? permalink parent award report block reply stevethefish76 7 points 2 days ago Yes. At the Standard Hotel. The little black boy never woke up after he was done with him, freaked out, and Bourdaine was witness to the aftermath/cleanup. permalink parent award report block reply Tacitus1963 5 points 2 days ago Then, as the story goes, he made the mistake of bringing it to the West Hollywood police many of whom are probably gay like Schitt or bi and would cover for him. permalink parent award report block reply JohnBarronGalt 4 points 2 days ago At least one permalink parent award report block reply Tacitus1963 3 points 2 days ago That's what I have seen repeatedly online over the years since Bourdain's \"suicide.\" permalink parent award report block reply that_sound 10 points 2 days ago Didn't Ed Buck finally get put away for killing one of his victims? Ed Buck got put away for killing TWO of his victims, but would have gotten away with both had he not nearly killed another. The first murder (that we know about) by meth overdose on July 27, 2017 was covered up as an accidental OD by authorities (thanks Adam Schiff). The family of the African-American victim Gemmel Moore warned Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey that any further deaths would be her responsibility. On January 7, 2019, another African-American man, Timothy Michael Dean was found dead similar to how Moore was found (meth overdose). Because this was the second death, you can guess what happened. NOTHING! (thanks Adam Schiff)! Then on September 11, 2019 Buck caused the overdose of another African-American man by meth OD, but this one survived. The families of the deceased and a coalition of civil rights organizations forced the hands of authorities (Buck was seemingly exclusively killing blacks). Buck was arrested 6 days later, and eventually charged with and convicted of causing the deaths of Moore and Dean, and in 2022 sentenced to 30 years. He is 71 years old. permalink parent award report block reply Meatsuit 2 points 1 day ago Thank you for summarizing.

You think ALL of the Deep State goons that the Trump DOJ is indicting are going to skate? Pretty bold prediction permalink parent award report block reply Mortal_Wombat 1 points 1 day ago I'm not criticizing Trumps efforts dicknose. But the deepstate didn't get deep by letting their ilk get indicted and prosecuted. They have many ways of altering outcomes of cases in their favor. And there isn't anything they wouldn't be willing to do. So sorry not sorry for being slightly pessimistic about a sitting senator getting sent to prison. permalink parent award report block reply Mortal_Wombat 1 points 1 day ago And nice strawman too faggot. Did I say ALL the indictments will skate? I'm speaking solely of a sitting senator. That's a pretty BOLD statement. permalink parent award report block reply MajorClark 14 points 2 days ago What happened at the Standard Hotel.  Schiff called Valerie Jarrett & they spoke for 45 min.  Shortly after a big yellow drum was seen rolling out of pedophile Schiffs room with a lid attached.   What happened to the little black child?   Schiff deserves to hang. permalink award report block reply Chickensaurus 10 points 2 days ago I'm bracing for nothing of any substance to be done. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 8 points 2 days ago Seriously, he'll just run out the clock on the Trump administration and be free of it. permalink parent award report block reply 46DindoNuffin 8 points 2 days ago \"Blumenthal warned that prosecuting Schiff would \"tear down the rule of law that protects them and all Americans.\"  Do these hypocrites ever get tired of lying?  After they desperately tried to put Trump and hundreds of followers in jail, and the current DOJ is weaponized?  I think that Obama started that train rolling. permalink award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 1 points 2 days ago Lol exactly, these people hold our side to standards that they could never live up to.
