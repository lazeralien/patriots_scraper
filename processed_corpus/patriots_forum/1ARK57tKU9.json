What's the problem? Just don't get obsessed. permalink parent award report block reply FusionBlack 7 points 4 days ago As I approach my late 60s this rings true. After a bought of serious health issues all of the cars went along with the boat and motorcycles. All of the things I thought were more important than life itself. I am at peace for the first time in my life. It's not what you possess. It's what you have always had from the beginning. Life itself. permalink award report block reply KrebStar2000 6 points 4 days ago The sentiment of this message is spot on, but a $30 watch and an $800 watch most certainly do not keep the same time. If you\u2019re in to guns, ammo, NVD\u2019s, and being prepared then you better understand a quality time piece is not to be skimped on. permalink award report block reply NomadicKrow2 1 points 4 days ago I would actually push people toward FLIR devices. Less expensive, more rugged, see in the dark and have heat signatures highlighted, and the only way someone can hide is if they're behind a pane of glass. They come in scopes or nods, monocles too. Commercial Night Vision usually uses an infrared light and a a filter over a lens to give you night vision. If someone has IR or NV, that light is visible to them and you might as well be putting a gun to your own head. permalink parent award report block reply Bushwookiee07 6 points 4 days ago That\u2019s a bold claim for a Ford. permalink award report block reply dontdrinksoy 2 points 4 days ago He should have put Toyota in the image instead. permalink parent award report block reply Skogin 5 points 4 days ago I swear, my retort was going to be quality bang sticks. permalink award report block reply Standingoak 2 points 4 days ago Lots of Ukrainians might still be alive if they had this old boy's skill and Drone Duster . permalink parent award report block reply ChyNahAzzWhole1 4 points 4 days ago Night optics... sunovabitch!

Sure, I could buy some big-box Ryobi garbage. However, a commercial Stihl will outlast 10-15 Ryobis and still be worth something in 15-20 years. Plus, I trade sweat for tools. I had to learn a new trade last week. Rather than pay a dick $300+. I splurged on the proper tools for $40 and learned how to make a j-channel opening in vinyl for a vent. I might never cut vinyl siding again, but the mitres are clean. permalink award report block reply Donger-Lord 2 points 4 days ago Very sad to see what has happened to Glock, they set a bad precedent by discontinuing most of their old models. permalink award report block reply Hanrahan 2 points 4 days ago He ain't lyin permalink award report block reply citydwellertrumpfan 2 points 4 days ago Our opinions of what wealth and luxury are is socially derived (tv, peers, etc), and the pursuit of luxury has diminishing returns.
