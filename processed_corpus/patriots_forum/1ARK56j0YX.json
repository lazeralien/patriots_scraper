It's almost as if 70% of the federal government is a waste  and I'm being incredibly generous with that number. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 8 points 5 days ago Unless you\u2019re a federal employee or in the military the shutdown for the most part wasn\u2019t going to affect your average person for the first few weeks. But Dems know that the best way to try and hurt Trump is to affect air travel which is why they\u2019re resisting passing a stand-alone bill paying feds since that would keep TSA and air traffic controllers from calling out en masse. permalink parent award report block reply Agenda47 8 points 5 days ago SNAPricans, proud descendants of the legendary Basketball Americans. permalink parent award report block reply Emodius 6 points 5 days ago Lmao at SNAPricans.

The request goes to her, she has to refer it to the full court, and they all vote on stays like this. She likely voted against it. She didn\u2019t make this decision. permalink parent award report block reply killedmytv 19 points 5 days ago The only reason Jumanji (or whoever wrote her homework assignment for her) did this is because she thinks it'll hurt Trump among the welfare class and useful idiots who get all their news from the TV. There's no way she did this because it was the right decision. permalink award report block reply MasterChief08 8 points 5 days ago The welfare class overwhelmingly votes Democrat regardless.  And the ones who don't are typically truly disabled Americans who know this shutdown is 100% on Democrats. permalink parent award report block reply lefty295 5 points 5 days ago She didn\u2019t do this. You\u2019re all wrong about this. She is assigned the 1st circuit. Rhode Island where the district court is, falls under that. She MUST refer all requests to the full SCOTUS, who then vote on the stay. She doesn\u2019t decide this on her own. She has to bring it to the full court. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 3 points 5 days ago There are some Dems on social media demanding to know why she did it so that will be interesting. permalink parent award report block reply lefty295 4 points 5 days ago She didn\u2019t, they just don\u2019t understand how stays with SCOTUS work. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 4 points 5 days ago They don't understand much, to be honest. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 2 points 5 days ago That and I suspect it's bad for the supreme court to let a lower court have that much power. She wants that power. permalink parent award report block reply lefty295 15 points 5 days ago That\u2019s not how it works. That\u2019s not her decision. She issues it because she was assigned that circuit. The request goes to her, she MUST refer it to the full court, and they all vote on it. This is not Jackson deciding it should be stayed. This the full SCOTUS voting for a stay, and it\u2019s in her assigned circuit. permalink award report block reply ForceMultiplier 1 points 4 days ago I sure wish that u/hocuspocusfocusjeep would spend 30 seconds to drop the url we all know he has, so I could explore the context. permalink parent award report block reply we_won_the_war_jack 10 points 5 days ago It\u2019s a play then.
