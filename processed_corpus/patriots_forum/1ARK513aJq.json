EBT is a government subsidy program, and it exploded under Biden. Whenever the government subsidizes something, prices shoot up because of increased demand. It's the same reason college became unaffordable.

That walmart cart price was followed for a year, if I remember the walmart CEO interview. Trump pumped gas ans imported eggs on day one. It worked until now. Now he just put sanctions on Russian gas and oil, at the same time than the EU did, so that will increase gas prices back a bit. There\u2019s also a 10 % tariff on Canadian oil.

We have local family farms. By family I mean actual humans who are out in the patures hands 365. They do it all. They also work side hustles etc. We buy our beef from them at 4.50/lb to 5.50 lb. Including locallly processing. Thats all cuts from filet to stew. They are invested in the community. They make ends meet. 99 cents/lb is imported cattle rasied in ways that would make yoiur blood boil. And the flavor/quality is awsesome. I budget for the higher price each year and it lasts all year.

It\u2019s closer to $9/lb for ground beef and he barely gets by on that. The cost of cattle not tainted by grains and the cost of processing make it a very cut throat side job for him.

I have NO idea how they break even on the price. But the whole family work full time off the farms too.

Footstuffs are unique in that their consumption is very inelastic, the demand doesn't change much based on prices. The total population needs a certain amount of total calories and that doesn't change quickly.  Certain types of food are elastic, people may substitute chicken for steak, cereal for bacon and eggs, etc.  But staples are more effected by production cost changes. Rather, what we will see is slow adaption.  Home gardens, less children, cuts to elsewhere in the budget. permalink award report block reply ianpatrick1966 1 points 6 days ago This is true to an extent but if SNAP isn't funding an entire class of degenerate losers, then the demand will go down.
