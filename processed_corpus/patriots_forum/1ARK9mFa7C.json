Other significant crops include bananas, cut flowers, palm oil, and sugarcane.

GOOD. permalink award report block reply f_bastiat 12 points 19 hours ago As much as I hate the NSA, the US doesn't need intelligence from anyone, we already have everything that ever existed and are set up to receive everything that hasn't come to be yet. permalink award report block reply The_Bloofy_Bullshark 3 points 14 hours ago NSA is only a small piece to the puzzle too. The US has a good number of spooky units, and most folks barely know they exist. The ISA (The Activity) is JSOC\u2019s covert brain and muscle, running live HUMINT, SIGINT, and targeting for the shooters. INSCOM runs field signals and human intel, often buried deep with JSOC teams. DIA\u2019s Defense Clandestine Service is the Pentagon\u2019s own network of spies working long-term sources in denied zones. ONI\u2019s deep ops teams handle undersea and maritime reconnaissance that never makes the news. The Air Force\u2019s 24th SOW and 17th STS tie ISR and precision targeting directly into special ops. MARSOC\u2019s tech teams manage digital recon and exploitation for Raider missions. Cyber Command and NSA\u2019s hunt teams do the dirty work in the digital battlespace, finding, breaking, and weaponizing access. Together they form the quiet layer between SOF and the three-letter agencies, the ones who see everything before the lights go out. I\u2019ve seen a number of these guys in action and it\u2019s something else entirely. Pure competence of the highest order. The ISA is in its own class. Every major nation has its own \u201cshadow service\u201d for technical reconnaissance and covert HUMINT, but the Activity sits in a category that most allies don\u2019t even attempt to replicate. Basically we have eyes, ears, and then some all over the globe at all times. permalink parent award report block reply BreakingCNN 2 points 19 hours ago Well that explains the WMDs in Iraq.\nFyi: the most surprised person to find out that Iraq did not have WMDs was Saddam Hussein. permalink parent award report block reply PhantomShield72 12 points 19 hours ago You're confusing the concepts of an intelligence failure and a disinformation op utilized as Casus Belli. permalink parent award report block reply PROCIsAsshoe 4 points 18 hours ago seriously, it's such an easy situation to parse out: Saddam would've known that his regime was doomed in the early hours of a ground invasion. Why wouldn't he have just used a WMD against our invasion forces out in the desert as we began the campaign? He had nothing left to lose and, generally, the entire motivation for possessing WMD's is that it precludes the ability for an enemy force to conduct a ground invasion of your country. He didn't ever have them, like you've said! permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 17 hours ago I'll never buy that Iraq didn't have WMDs or the capability of making them simply based on their actions for over a decade. I'm not sure how anti-government you have to be to watch a country obstruct nuclear capability inspections dozens of times over 10+ years and then when you finally invade with tons of warning, posturing and time ahead of it, and believe that they suddenly don't have any WMD capabilities. Agreeing with the invasion is separate.  That was a terrible mistake.  Iraq should have been handled like Trump handled Syria and Iran. permalink parent award report block reply BreakingCNN 3 points 19 hours ago No, it was not a disinformation op.\nRemember what happened to the Iraqi soccer coach who lost? The heads of the Iraqi N, B, and C we're all sending reports to Saddam telling him what great progress they were making. These reports were intercepted by Echelon.  Additionally, as they already had these reports drafted they went ahead and sold them to the Mossad for a sizable chunk of change. And finally the US was picking up some of the chatter which was then confirmed by the British and the Israelis. Plus, just cause, oh wait I think that was Grenada or something, never mind permalink parent award report block reply learntocode 1 points 14 hours ago Except for Our Greatest Ally. Cannot touch them. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 0 points 13 hours ago We get everything from Israel. permalink parent award report block reply f_bastiat 1 points 8 hours ago You are mistaken, Israel gets everything from us and gives back what's needed when using the information in an investigation presents a rights violation if we are the source. Israel is essentially a government agency that does nothing without us, it's quite comical how deep people go on here with the IsRaEl CoNtRoLs EvErYtHiNg. They are a population smaller than some of our smaller states, surrounded by blood thirsty mudslimes, and their land is essentially useless other than as the American base it is. permalink parent award report block reply Coprolite 11 points 19 hours ago So anyway I blew up another one. permalink award report block reply mty_green_go 4 points 12 hours ago So anyway we started blasting permalink parent award report block reply RichardCranium88 9 points 17 hours ago That's a laugh. as if the Colombia president isn't complicit in drug trafficking. permalink award report block reply Beelzy 8 points 19 hours ago Shit, we know what they eat for dinner before they head out.

The US has a good number of spooky units, and most folks barely know they exist. The ISA (The Activity) is JSOC\u2019s covert brain and muscle, running live HUMINT, SIGINT, and targeting for the shooters. INSCOM runs field signals and human intel, often buried deep with JSOC teams. DIA\u2019s Defense Clandestine Service is the Pentagon\u2019s own network of spies working long-term sources in denied zones. ONI\u2019s deep ops teams handle undersea and maritime reconnaissance that never makes the news. The Air Force\u2019s 24th SOW and 17th STS tie ISR and precision targeting directly into special ops. MARSOC\u2019s tech teams manage digital recon and exploitation for Raider missions. Cyber Command and NSA\u2019s hunt teams do the dirty work in the digital battlespace, finding, breaking, and weaponizing access. Together they form the quiet layer between SOF and the three-letter agencies, the ones who see everything before the lights go out. I\u2019ve seen a number of these guys in action and it\u2019s something else entirely. Pure competence of the highest order. The ISA is in its own class. Every major nation has its own \u201cshadow service\u201d for technical reconnaissance and covert HUMINT, but the Activity sits in a category that most allies don\u2019t even attempt to replicate.
