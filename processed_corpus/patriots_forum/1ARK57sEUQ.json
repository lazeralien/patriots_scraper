Even after you've paid off a home, you're still subjected to being taxed on it or they'll steal your home. permalink parent award report block reply Cetera -43 points 4 days ago Property taxes aren't debt. They are a duty and an obligation to the community, however, and that trade-off, of the community granting you exclusive and monopolistic rights to the land in exchange for you contributing to the community, has been a thing for 5k+ years (and is also mandated in the Bible). The libertarian thought process on property taxes is stupid, just as is most of the libertarian ideals and thought processes. Property taxes are moral and just. Indeed, they may be the most moral and just taxes, and they are one of the best means of taxing a populace for the good of the community. To start with, property taxes have been around for 5,000 years now. They're one of the oldest taxes known. They've proven historically and traditionally to be worth the cost they impose upon landowners because the benefits are so high and because the benefits are required for a community to survive. Property taxes are also biblical. They're part of Leviticus and non-optional. Communities require property to exist at all and in order to survive. Locking away that property in private ownership can still benefit the community and help the community to survive if the benefit to the community is greater under private ownership than in public or communal ownership. To that end, landowners have always had a duty and a responsibility to the community. Throughout history, this has taken many forms, but it has always existed. Failure to meet your duties and responsibilities to the community as a landowner, and your land was taken from you by force and given to someone else who would meet them. This has been considered just for time immemorial. This is wrapped up in the concept of noblesse oblige but also in others throughout history. Landowners in our country at its founding had responsibilities to the body politic in terms of governance, but they had financial responsibilities as well. All of them paid property taxes. Property taxes are also always inherently local. There is no national property tax, no federal property tax. They're assessed locally, they're collected locally, and they're spent locally. In probably 99% of the areas in this country, a group of coordinated voters of no more than 1,000 individuals could likely completely control every aspect of property taxes in their locality, and in perhaps 50% of the country as few as a hundred or two citizens could do so. If you live in an urban metro area, yeah, you're not going to be able to influence property tax policy much. That's part of the cost of living in an urban area. But for the vast majority, they absolutely can. There's no nonsense about taxation without representation. If you have a problem with the way your taxes are assessed, collected, or spent, you can do something about it. Finally, the primary benefit of property taxes isn't that they fund local community spending on whatever the community decides to spend it on. The primary benefit of property taxes is keeping property available for the common individual to have the opportunity to purchase. Without property taxes, it would be vastly easier for wealthy individuals, organizations, and conglomerates to buy up land and squat on it. Land is a finite resource. More isn't going to be made, even as the population has continued to grow across the planet. One person or family owning land deprives anyone else of owning that land, and not all land is created equally. Some land is much more valuable than other land, either due to water availability, natural beauty, or other resources. Locking up land in perpetual, essentially \"free\" ownership does an injustice to the rest of the public and certainly to future generations. Property taxes provide a \"sink\" that forces a certain level of utility to the land. This does benefit the community. It also means that retired people without income have to come up with a way to pay their property taxes. That sucks, but that is part and parcel of owning land. If you can't afford it in perpetuity, you can't afford it. You can sell it, you can rent it out, you can give it to your offspring and let them pay for it and put you up on it, or whatever. But property taxes are inherently a good thing, even though they suck having to pay. It seems to me that most people that are against property taxes in all forms have misguided notions and tend toward libertarian ideals, and they lack experience in human nature or haven't pursued the logical ends fully enough. They may also be seeking license, confusing that with freedom, and attempting to have their free lunch. We gotta remember TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Leviticus 27:30-33: \"Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's; it is holy to the Lord. If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the Lord.\" Leviticus 25:23-24: \"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\" 1 Chronicles 29:14-16: \"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.\" Romans 13:6-7: \"For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\" Matthew 22:17-21: \"Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.\" And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them, \"Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" permalink parent award report block reply view 28 more comments... deleted 19 points 4 days ago Cetera 20 points 4 days ago It isn't being floated so people can have extra overhead and make extra payments and pay it off quicker.  It is being floated because people can't make the minimum payments NOW. No one is going to pay it off early. They're going to barely be able to make the payments on the 50-year note, and they'll be enslaved for life. Particularly as the value of the property is guaranteed to decline unless they purposefully blow up the dollar into hyperinflation. We're facing the greatest demographic collapse the nation has ever seen, and one of the top five the world has ever seen in history. Younger adults aren't having kids, aren't forming families. The boomers are buying more and more property, but they're also starting to die off, and they can't sell the property because the next generations can't afford to buy it from them. There isn't going to be a supply problem. There's going to be a supply glut, coupled with a drastic decrease in demand.  Within the next 5 years or so, we'll likely see the average home price going for what houses sold for in 2011. If you owe a 50-year note on 2025 prices that you can't afford, or can only barely afford, you're done for life. You'll be destitute forever. And if you and everyone else defaults on it, it blows up the banking system worse than 2008 and the U.S. gov't as we know it is over.

Great inflation hedge, and sometimes some significant profit.  I think Trump is basically just looking to make them available to average and lower-income buyers by making them eligible for federally sponsored mortgage trading and securitization programs (e.g. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac), and federally subsidized mortgages like VA mortgages. u/Cetera permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments... RandomUzer 10 points 4 days ago At 5-6% you nearly double the price of what you pay in 30 years.  It would be that over that again.  I would have to make a table for it but I would guess at least 5x the purchase price. Loans are banks way of taking your money.  Take them if you must but avoid them if you can.  Unless you can pay that thing back ASAP you are burning money that you could use to loan out to others who do not understand it.  Banks do. This would just be stealing your equity.

Back when we bought, we were required to have 20% down. We kept saving past that and ended up buying a cheaper home than we planned so our down payment ended up being nearly 35% of the purchase price. We also paid additional money every month on the mortgage to get out of debt faster. We also refinanced when interest rates dropped and started paying even more money every month to reduce the principle. We paid off our 30 year mortgage off in just over 20 years. The savings were substantial between the big down payment (so smaller loan amount) and paying off some of the principle by overpaying starting with our first payment. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 10 points 4 days ago I think the multigenerational home is the next step.

Yep. That's what happens when you go from a high-trust society to a low-trust society and people are required to spend more time indoors in their houses for recreation and entertainment because the streets aren't safe for the kids to play in, nor for you to be out and about on alone. It is also what happens in a gig-economy when people need their homes to double as office space for home businesses, or working remotely.

Despite what you may believe, forcing these dinosaur bureaucracies to change course will NEVER happen overnight. Not without violating everyone\u2019s natural rights that is.

Yeah this sucks permalink parent award report block reply NamendaBiden 1 points 4 days ago 40 years into the loan and inflation makes that $2083 pretty manageable. permalink parent award report block reply goatnuts 1 points 3 days ago And any benefit you get from that gets eaten up by your property tax bill. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby -6 points 4 days ago Buy a cheaper house permalink parent award report block reply MasterChief 8 points 4 days ago Just live in your car.

And this might be preferable to them corralling people into small ugly expensive apartments. permalink parent award report block reply TheGreatWhiteNorth 2 points 3 days ago \"And this might be preferable to them corralling people into small ugly expensive apartments.\" Yes, it is preferable.  Here in Canada, cost of living and housing is through the roof.  Jobs are disappearing and what's left are being given to the 'foreign visitors' (illegal alien invasion force).  Crime skyrocketing.  It's all manufactured decline.  Government IS corralling people into small, ugly expensive apartments.  Fifteen-minute Cities, bug burgers, 'you will own nothing and be happy'.  You'll be too poor and terrorized by government and society to be able to do a thing about it.  Censorship.  If you try to fight, they'll shut down your bank account.  Booze and drugs available on every corner. And, it won't stop there.  Ultimately, they'll be force-injecting everyone with 'Safe and Effective' so that people are weakened, have less babies, and don't live long enough to be a so-called 'burden' to society.  MAID Service for those who feel a little down.  Population Replacement coming to a town near you.  That's what the Agenda 2030 WEF Marxist-globalists have in-the-works for Canada. Human beings can certainly make foolish mistakes.

The goal is to increase, not decrease home ownership. permalink parent award report block reply -Evspra 2 points 4 days ago home \"ownership\" includes... owning the home. 50 year loans make that extremely unlikely. interest is tax deductible you\u2019re still paying a ton of interest before you get a fraction of it back. getting a tax deduction on money you didn\u2019t need to spend isn\u2019t a win refinancing, paying off early if someone takes a 30 year loan and aggressively pays extra to cut it down, they basically made their own 15 year schedule anyway many people cannot afford 15 year loans paying 2x the house value in interest alone is financial suicide permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I think the main reason Trump is floating the 50 year mortgage as a potential solution is because of debt to income ratios. A lot of potential homeowners are gated out even if they have the savings for a down payment because the DTI requirements a lot of lenders ask disqualify them. With 50 year mortgages, the lower monthly principals mean that a lot of the younger citizens can qualify, and if they pay principals that match a 30 year mortgage, that means they get a 30 year mortgage without getting disqualified because of inane requirements. I think Trump is betting on lowering interest rates and gassing the economy to try to give young homeowners an easier time in obtaining housing. permalink parent award report block reply neomt 1 points 4 days ago We don't have people here who even understand home loans.

I dont even want to fuck with a standard 30 year, much less 50. permalink award report block reply lizardo221 2 points 4 days ago I'm a little confused by the negativity of this on this site because nobody is compelled to pay for 50 years. A 50 year loan does not mandate that it must be paid over 50 years exactly. For example, you could just pay it off faster and do it in 30, resulting in the current system, or you have the option to go longer. I'm not disputing anything about interest rates, but I'm saying that if you take our exact system now but give the option for 50 year loans, isn't that just a net improvement to the consumers because it gives poorer people an option to buy? Also, doing this doesn't mean we can't also reduce costs for building. If anything, this tweet tells us that he is aware of the housing issues and is throwing out ideas to see what works and what doesn't. We might see a large plan in a few weeks that includes this and a lot of other ideas to help home buying. Edit: let me add that I'm assuming no pre paid penalty, which the real estate lawyer next to me is saying they would typically not do in these kinds of loans. permalink award report block reply corporateshizer 2 points 4 days ago The negativity comes from us wanting a government that actually fixes the problems the government created, like the immigration crisis, instead of creating new problems with their 'fixes.' It's like throwing a drowning person a cheeseburger and then saying you don't understand why the other person isn't happy, they got a free cheeeburger. Big fucking whoop. We don't want bullshit pretend fixes that makes everything worse. We want real change that helps everyday Americans and hurts the orgs like Blackrock, Vanguard, the WEF/Open Society Foundation, and all the other assholes engineering America's demise. permalink parent award report block reply lizardo221 0 points 4 days ago First off, we are going off of a random picture with a one liner. This is not a complex statement on policy. So everyone should breath for a moment and be thankful this is on the President's mind enough that he is throwing out ideas. Do I think this solves everything? No, and I'm sure the President would agree. But what everyone has lost me on is why they claim this is somehow making the situation worse. I have not seen a single argument as to how this will make people less likely to buy a house. All of the interest rate arguments are silly because you only lose money renting! 50 years of interest is about what you would spend actually to rent a place of probably worse quality for 50 years straight. And typically rent agreements are not 50 years, so expect your rent to go up while a fixed-rate mortgage could save you money instead! permalink parent award report block reply corporateshizer 1 points 4 days ago It would make people interested in regular mortgages less likely to buy a house because prices would increase from the increase in demand. There would be more people buying houses that they cannot really afford who are driving up the price of real estate, while responsible people who want a regular American existence and mortgage get pushed further back. See what happened from 2003-2008 if you don't understand how selling people houses they can't afford fucks up the market and ends up in a disaster. permalink parent award report block reply lizardo221 1 points 4 days ago Let me be blunt: my family knows more about that era and the market than most people ever will. One member was a real estate lawyer for a very large company who warned many people about the problems with those types of loans then. The main problem was that the loan gave you an option to pay less interest in a given payment, but the missing interest was applied to the principle. Financially illiterate people did this, and eventually they racked up impossible amounts of debt. Nothing like that is being discussed here, and I would hope to never see those types of loans again. As for supply and demand, that doesn't work well as an argument because I can claim the inverse hypothetical that builders will be spurred on by money and growth to make more houses to match the rising demand. More people will move to newer houses, freeing up cheaper ones that poorer people can buy. The proof is in the many housing bubbles and booms throughout history in many countries. Lastly, your whole use of \"regular\" or \"American\" are just subjective, emotional appeals. What makes 30 vs 50 any more \"American\"??? For fuck sake, this country went into massive amounts of financial debt just to win it's freedom! Are you going to tell me the founders were somehow less \"American\" for taking loans from France??! How much is too much? Next time I see a loan, I better check it's nationality first! permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... julianReyes -1 points 4 days ago PDW is just Retarddit in a Scooby Doo monster costume.

However, the payment for the same amount, even at a higher rate is lower for the 30 year.  Factor in inflation (the amount you borrow in 2025 is going to be worth a lot less in 2075), the fact that people often sell and move before they pay off 100%, and the deductibility of interest on home mortgages, this isn't a bad deal. permalink award report block reply julianReyes 2 points 4 days ago I can REALLY tell this \"secretly red\" comment section is being raided by Retardittors because they don't know the first thing about owning a home (cough cough \"omfg I can NEVER refinance my home later on with 50 year mortgages!!11!!\"). permalink parent award report block reply lizardo221 1 points 4 days ago Take my up vote, I have but only 1 to give!

Density is an actual phyiscal problem that needs to be managed correctly for water/sewer to work correctly.

Renters who can't currently qualify for a home loan, but who pay more in rent than they would with said home loan. You know what else they don't get?  Equity. Fun fact, you don't have to live out that mortgage. You can sell that house in year 60, 40, 20, or hell the day after you close.  But whatever time you do spend there, you're gaining at least some equity instead of paying 100%.  Further, except for very short periods of time, housing prices always increase.  So stay there for 3-7 years, sell it, get some equity and appreciation from it, pay the mortgage off, and buy another house at (likely) a better interest rate, better credit score, bigger down payment, better income, and shorter mortgage. Funner fact, if you don't want to sell, you can also always refinance into a NOT 50 year mortgage, at (again likely) a lower rate, better terms, and better economic situation. permalink parent award report block reply Nantucketghost 2 points 4 days ago This won't work.

This would further inflate housing prices.  Depending on the prices, If I locked in at buying a home at 20, it will be paid off by the time I am 70?  If the housing prices remained \"low\", over time from 20 your wage should jump up, hopefully and if you are smart will make more payments heading off interest. Of course, this is not how our system has worked.  Banks and investors will tweak the market to jack up home prices and interest rates to dickbag levels.  Instead of paying a $1500 mortgage for 30 years, you'll just be paying $1500 for 50 years.  Initially, this will help affordability, but over time it will become another crippling monster.

I don't see how people will ever be able to come up with a down-payment that will free them from mortgage insurance when they can't afford to buy their first home otherwise, and won't be able to build equity.

(a) \u201cHome Leasing\u201d means a renewable lease agreement for a primary residence with fixed monthly payments, no down payment requirement, included maintenance, and an option to vacate or relocate without penalty after a minimum term of 12 months. (b) \u201cMortgage-Based Ownership\u201d means any secured loan tied to real property with terms exceeding 10 years. Section 3. Federal Policy Shift.

(b) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall establish the National Home Leasing Corporation (NHLC) , a public-private entity tasked with: Converting existing mortgage-backed securities into lease-backed securities. Offering landlords tax credits for capping lease rates at 25% of median area income. Guaranteeing lease portability nationwide (a lessee in Ohio may transfer their lease to an equivalent unit in Texas without credit re-qualification). Section 4. Mortgage Phase-Out. (a) No new 15-, 30-, or 50-year mortgages shall be originated after December 31, 2028 . (b) Existing mortgages may be voluntarily converted to NHLC leases at a 1:1 payment ratio with principal forgiveness for underwater borrowers. (c) The Federal Reserve shall adjust monetary policy to prioritize lease-backed securities over mortgage-backed securities in its balance sheet. Section 5. Protections and Incentives. (a) Rent-to-Own Opt-Out : Lessees may accrue up to 20% of lease payments toward a future down payment, redeemable only if they exit the program. (b) Eviction Moratorium : Landlords participating in NHLC leases are prohibited from eviction except for non-payment exceeding 90 days or felony activity. (c) Corporate Landlord Cap : No single entity may control more than 5% of NHLC lease units in any metropolitan statistical area. Section 6. Implementation. (a) The Secretary of HUD, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall issue regulations within 180 days . (b) A National Lease Registry shall track all NHLC units, ensuring transparency and preventing price gouging via blockchain-based smart contracts. Section 7. General Provisions. (a) This Order supersedes any conflicting federal regulation. (b) If any provision is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect.

But this is probably the current best alternative to owning nothing and being happy with it. The current option for 35% of all Americans is paying someone else's mortgage (or blackrock) via rent and owning nothing, and they pay 35-50% of their income to do so. This will only work with when you combine it with kicking 20M illegals out of the country to lower housing prices, and banning investment companies from owning single family homes. permalink award report block reply CaJuN-Polak 1 points 4 days ago Well ... if he can get the interest percentages way down, like 1% or less, then 50yrs won't be bad .... but still a bad idea to have a loan out that far.

So, one doesn't have to take 50 years to pay off a house. If I was in the market now, I would be leery of buying a new home as i don't think most of the ones going up today are built to last.  So, forty years from now, one could still be making payments on a house that fell to pieces after 25 years. permalink award report block reply RocksCanOnlyWait 1 points 4 days ago Or we could just let the free market decide what works best.

My target audience is people who pay 2k in rent for the last 10 years but can't get approved for a 2K mortgage.   Many such cases.  This would make the payment like 1400 or something so the bank is satisfied you can pay it, but nothing is stopping you from paying 2k.  I made up all my numbers but you get the idea. permalink parent award report block reply Goozmania 1 points 4 days ago But just extending loans doesn't actually fix the problem.

You gain equity, you gain house value appreciation.  You can sell the fucking thing, you can refinance it... a mortgage isn't some blood bound magical contract. And it's incredibly likely that the mortgage payment (even WITH taxes, insurance etc. included) is less than your rent. Truly owning nothing means YOU RENT.  Which is exactly what the people that would take these loans do right now. permalink award report block reply NamendaBiden 0 points 4 days ago Im ok with it.  50 year should carry a lower interest rate vs 30 and rounding up the payment to the nearest hundred could easily shave a decade off the length of the loan. Plus, buying is the hard part.  Once you own the house, refinance into a 30,20,15, or 10 year mortgage when interest rates are low. permalink award report block reply E-dantes 1 points 4 days ago It's called rent that you'll never pay off, now with property taxes!!

When you rent, you keep nothing. You also can just pay off the loan faster as you get older and typically have increased your wealth. Am I in lifetime servitude if I spend 25 years on one loan, sell that house afterward to buy a bigger and newer house with a loan of 25 years? And then that wealth can go to my children or grandchildren. I'm not saying all 50 year loans solves everything for housing, but I'm just not seeing why this is so bad like you claim. permalink parent award report block reply E-dantes 1 points 4 days ago Oh, no reply?

Even after you've paid off a home, you're still subjected to being taxed on it or they'll steal your home. permalink parent award report block reply Cetera -43 points 4 days ago Property taxes aren't debt. They are a duty and an obligation to the community, however, and that trade-off, of the community granting you exclusive and monopolistic rights to the land in exchange for you contributing to the community, has been a thing for 5k+ years (and is also mandated in the Bible). The libertarian thought process on property taxes is stupid, just as is most of the libertarian ideals and thought processes. Property taxes are moral and just. Indeed, they may be the most moral and just taxes, and they are one of the best means of taxing a populace for the good of the community. To start with, property taxes have been around for 5,000 years now. They're one of the oldest taxes known. They've proven historically and traditionally to be worth the cost they impose upon landowners because the benefits are so high and because the benefits are required for a community to survive. Property taxes are also biblical. They're part of Leviticus and non-optional. Communities require property to exist at all and in order to survive. Locking away that property in private ownership can still benefit the community and help the community to survive if the benefit to the community is greater under private ownership than in public or communal ownership. To that end, landowners have always had a duty and a responsibility to the community. Throughout history, this has taken many forms, but it has always existed. Failure to meet your duties and responsibilities to the community as a landowner, and your land was taken from you by force and given to someone else who would meet them. This has been considered just for time immemorial. This is wrapped up in the concept of noblesse oblige but also in others throughout history. Landowners in our country at its founding had responsibilities to the body politic in terms of governance, but they had financial responsibilities as well. All of them paid property taxes. Property taxes are also always inherently local. There is no national property tax, no federal property tax. They're assessed locally, they're collected locally, and they're spent locally. In probably 99% of the areas in this country, a group of coordinated voters of no more than 1,000 individuals could likely completely control every aspect of property taxes in their locality, and in perhaps 50% of the country as few as a hundred or two citizens could do so. If you live in an urban metro area, yeah, you're not going to be able to influence property tax policy much. That's part of the cost of living in an urban area. But for the vast majority, they absolutely can. There's no nonsense about taxation without representation. If you have a problem with the way your taxes are assessed, collected, or spent, you can do something about it. Finally, the primary benefit of property taxes isn't that they fund local community spending on whatever the community decides to spend it on. The primary benefit of property taxes is keeping property available for the common individual to have the opportunity to purchase. Without property taxes, it would be vastly easier for wealthy individuals, organizations, and conglomerates to buy up land and squat on it. Land is a finite resource. More isn't going to be made, even as the population has continued to grow across the planet. One person or family owning land deprives anyone else of owning that land, and not all land is created equally. Some land is much more valuable than other land, either due to water availability, natural beauty, or other resources. Locking up land in perpetual, essentially \"free\" ownership does an injustice to the rest of the public and certainly to future generations. Property taxes provide a \"sink\" that forces a certain level of utility to the land. This does benefit the community. It also means that retired people without income have to come up with a way to pay their property taxes. That sucks, but that is part and parcel of owning land. If you can't afford it in perpetuity, you can't afford it. You can sell it, you can rent it out, you can give it to your offspring and let them pay for it and put you up on it, or whatever. But property taxes are inherently a good thing, even though they suck having to pay. It seems to me that most people that are against property taxes in all forms have misguided notions and tend toward libertarian ideals, and they lack experience in human nature or haven't pursued the logical ends fully enough. They may also be seeking license, confusing that with freedom, and attempting to have their free lunch. We gotta remember TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Leviticus 27:30-33: \"Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's; it is holy to the Lord. If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the Lord.\" Leviticus 25:23-24: \"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\" 1 Chronicles 29:14-16: \"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.\" Romans 13:6-7: \"For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\" Matthew 22:17-21: \"Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.\" And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them, \"Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" permalink parent award report block reply view 28 more comments... deleted 19 points 4 days ago Cetera 20 points 4 days ago It isn't being floated so people can have extra overhead and make extra payments and pay it off quicker.  It is being floated because people can't make the minimum payments NOW. No one is going to pay it off early. They're going to barely be able to make the payments on the 50-year note, and they'll be enslaved for life. Particularly as the value of the property is guaranteed to decline unless they purposefully blow up the dollar into hyperinflation. We're facing the greatest demographic collapse the nation has ever seen, and one of the top five the world has ever seen in history. Younger adults aren't having kids, aren't forming families. The boomers are buying more and more property, but they're also starting to die off, and they can't sell the property because the next generations can't afford to buy it from them. There isn't going to be a supply problem. There's going to be a supply glut, coupled with a drastic decrease in demand.  Within the next 5 years or so, we'll likely see the average home price going for what houses sold for in 2011. If you owe a 50-year note on 2025 prices that you can't afford, or can only barely afford, you're done for life. You'll be destitute forever.

Unless you can pay that thing back ASAP you are burning money that you could use to loan out to others who do not understand it.  Banks do. This would just be stealing your equity.

How about abolishing property taxes for starters, then nuking the Fed since they can't do their jobs worth a flying fuck. Longer mortgages makes as much sense as reducing drug dosage to keep a patient suffering longer. permalink parent award report block reply Cetera -9 points 4 days ago Property taxes are a very GOOD thing. They provide a sink that makes it a huge disincentive for corporations or non-productive community members to squat on property and stifle/kill the community. Property taxes are moral and just. Indeed, they may be the most moral and just taxes, and they are one of the best means of taxing a populace for the good of the community. To start with, property taxes have been around for 5,000 years now. They're one of the oldest taxes known. They've proven historically and traditionally to be worth the cost they impose upon landowners because the benefits are so high and because the benefits are required for a community to survive. Property taxes are also biblical. They're part of Leviticus and non-optional. Communities require property to exist at all and in order to survive. Locking away that property in private ownership can still benefit the community and help the community to survive if the benefit to the community is greater under private ownership than in public or communal ownership. To that end, landowners have always had a duty and a responsibility to the community. Throughout history, this has taken many forms, but it has always existed. Failure to meet your duties and responsibilities to the community as a landowner, and your land was taken from you by force and given to someone else who would meet them. This has been considered just for time immemorial. This is wrapped up in the concept of noblesse oblige but also in others throughout history. Landowners in our country at its founding had responsibilities to the body politic in terms of governance, but they had financial responsibilities as well. All of them paid property taxes. Property taxes are also always inherently local. There is no national property tax, no federal property tax. They're assessed locally, they're collected locally, and they're spent locally. In probably 99% of the areas in this country, a group of coordinated voters of no more than 1,000 individuals could likely completely control every aspect of property taxes in their locality, and in perhaps 50% of the country as few as a hundred or two citizens could do so. If you live in an urban metro area, yeah, you're not going to be able to influence property tax policy much. That's part of the cost of living in an urban area. But for the vast majority, they absolutely can. There's no nonsense about taxation without representation. If you have a problem with the way your taxes are assessed, collected, or spent, you can do something about it. Finally, the primary benefit of property taxes isn't that they fund local community spending on whatever the community decides to spend it on. The primary benefit of property taxes is keeping property available for the common individual to have the opportunity to purchase. Without property taxes, it would be vastly easier for wealthy individuals, organizations, and conglomerates to buy up land and squat on it. Land is a finite resource. More isn't going to be made, even as the population has continued to grow across the planet. One person or family owning land deprives anyone else of owning that land, and not all land is created equally. Some land is much more valuable than other land, either due to water availability, natural beauty, or other resources. Locking up land in perpetual, essentially \"free\" ownership does an injustice to the rest of the public and certainly to future generations. Property taxes provide a \"sink\" that forces a certain level of utility to the land. This does benefit the community. It also means that retired people without income have to come up with a way to pay their property taxes. That sucks, but that is part and parcel of owning land. If you can't afford it in perpetuity, you can't afford it. You can sell it, you can rent it out, you can give it to your offspring and let them pay for it and put you up on it, or whatever. But property taxes are inherently a good thing, even though they suck having to pay. It seems to me that most people that are against property taxes in all forms have misguided notions and tend toward libertarian ideals, and they lack experience in human nature or haven't pursued the logical ends fully enough. They may also be seeking license, confusing that with freedom, and attempting to have their free lunch. We gotta remember TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Leviticus 27:30-33: \"Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's; it is holy to the Lord. If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the Lord.\" Leviticus 25:23-24: \"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\" 1 Chronicles 29:14-16: \"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.\" Romans 13:6-7: \"For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\" Matthew 22:17-21: \"Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.\" And they brought him a denarius.

It is being floated because people can't make the minimum payments NOW. No one is going to pay it off early. They're going to barely be able to make the payments on the 50-year note, and they'll be enslaved for life. Particularly as the value of the property is guaranteed to decline unless they purposefully blow up the dollar into hyperinflation. We're facing the greatest demographic collapse the nation has ever seen, and one of the top five the world has ever seen in history. Younger adults aren't having kids, aren't forming families. The boomers are buying more and more property, but they're also starting to die off, and they can't sell the property because the next generations can't afford to buy it from them. There isn't going to be a supply problem. There's going to be a supply glut, coupled with a drastic decrease in demand.  Within the next 5 years or so, we'll likely see the average home price going for what houses sold for in 2011.

It also means that retired people without income have to come up with a way to pay their property taxes. That sucks, but that is part and parcel of owning land. If you can't afford it in perpetuity, you can't afford it. You can sell it, you can rent it out, you can give it to your offspring and let them pay for it and put you up on it, or whatever. But property taxes are inherently a good thing, even though they suck having to pay. It seems to me that most people that are against property taxes in all forms have misguided notions and tend toward libertarian ideals, and they lack experience in human nature or haven't pursued the logical ends fully enough. They may also be seeking license, confusing that with freedom, and attempting to have their free lunch. We gotta remember TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.

If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the Lord.\" Leviticus 25:23-24: \"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\" 1 Chronicles 29:14-16: \"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly?

Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.

Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\" Matthew 22:17-21: \"Tell us, then, what you think.

Even after you've paid off a home, you're still subjected to being taxed on it or they'll steal your home. permalink parent award report block reply Cetera -43 points 4 days ago Property taxes aren't debt. They are a duty and an obligation to the community, however, and that trade-off, of the community granting you exclusive and monopolistic rights to the land in exchange for you contributing to the community, has been a thing for 5k+ years (and is also mandated in the Bible). The libertarian thought process on property taxes is stupid, just as is most of the libertarian ideals and thought processes. Property taxes are moral and just. Indeed, they may be the most moral and just taxes, and they are one of the best means of taxing a populace for the good of the community. To start with, property taxes have been around for 5,000 years now. They're one of the oldest taxes known. They've proven historically and traditionally to be worth the cost they impose upon landowners because the benefits are so high and because the benefits are required for a community to survive. Property taxes are also biblical. They're part of Leviticus and non-optional. Communities require property to exist at all and in order to survive. Locking away that property in private ownership can still benefit the community and help the community to survive if the benefit to the community is greater under private ownership than in public or communal ownership. To that end, landowners have always had a duty and a responsibility to the community. Throughout history, this has taken many forms, but it has always existed. Failure to meet your duties and responsibilities to the community as a landowner, and your land was taken from you by force and given to someone else who would meet them. This has been considered just for time immemorial. This is wrapped up in the concept of noblesse oblige but also in others throughout history. Landowners in our country at its founding had responsibilities to the body politic in terms of governance, but they had financial responsibilities as well. All of them paid property taxes. Property taxes are also always inherently local. There is no national property tax, no federal property tax. They're assessed locally, they're collected locally, and they're spent locally. In probably 99% of the areas in this country, a group of coordinated voters of no more than 1,000 individuals could likely completely control every aspect of property taxes in their locality, and in perhaps 50% of the country as few as a hundred or two citizens could do so. If you live in an urban metro area, yeah, you're not going to be able to influence property tax policy much. That's part of the cost of living in an urban area. But for the vast majority, they absolutely can. There's no nonsense about taxation without representation. If you have a problem with the way your taxes are assessed, collected, or spent, you can do something about it. Finally, the primary benefit of property taxes isn't that they fund local community spending on whatever the community decides to spend it on. The primary benefit of property taxes is keeping property available for the common individual to have the opportunity to purchase. Without property taxes, it would be vastly easier for wealthy individuals, organizations, and conglomerates to buy up land and squat on it. Land is a finite resource. More isn't going to be made, even as the population has continued to grow across the planet. One person or family owning land deprives anyone else of owning that land, and not all land is created equally. Some land is much more valuable than other land, either due to water availability, natural beauty, or other resources. Locking up land in perpetual, essentially \"free\" ownership does an injustice to the rest of the public and certainly to future generations. Property taxes provide a \"sink\" that forces a certain level of utility to the land. This does benefit the community. It also means that retired people without income have to come up with a way to pay their property taxes. That sucks, but that is part and parcel of owning land. If you can't afford it in perpetuity, you can't afford it. You can sell it, you can rent it out, you can give it to your offspring and let them pay for it and put you up on it, or whatever. But property taxes are inherently a good thing, even though they suck having to pay. It seems to me that most people that are against property taxes in all forms have misguided notions and tend toward libertarian ideals, and they lack experience in human nature or haven't pursued the logical ends fully enough.

It is being floated because people can't make the minimum payments NOW. No one is going to pay it off early. They're going to barely be able to make the payments on the 50-year note, and they'll be enslaved for life. Particularly as the value of the property is guaranteed to decline unless they purposefully blow up the dollar into hyperinflation. We're facing the greatest demographic collapse the nation has ever seen, and one of the top five the world has ever seen in history. Younger adults aren't having kids, aren't forming families. The boomers are buying more and more property, but they're also starting to die off, and they can't sell the property because the next generations can't afford to buy it from them. There isn't going to be a supply problem. There's going to be a supply glut, coupled with a drastic decrease in demand.  Within the next 5 years or so, we'll likely see the average home price going for what houses sold for in 2011. If you owe a 50-year note on 2025 prices that you can't afford, or can only barely afford, you're done for life. You'll be destitute forever.

I would have to make a table for it but I would guess at least 5x the purchase price. Loans are banks way of taking your money.  Take them if you must but avoid them if you can.  Unless you can pay that thing back ASAP you are burning money that you could use to loan out to others who do not understand it.  Banks do. This would just be stealing your equity.

It is being floated because people can't make the minimum payments NOW. No one is going to pay it off early. They're going to barely be able to make the payments on the 50-year note, and they'll be enslaved for life. Particularly as the value of the property is guaranteed to decline unless they purposefully blow up the dollar into hyperinflation. We're facing the greatest demographic collapse the nation has ever seen, and one of the top five the world has ever seen in history. Younger adults aren't having kids, aren't forming families. The boomers are buying more and more property, but they're also starting to die off, and they can't sell the property because the next generations can't afford to buy it from them.

It would be that over that again.  I would have to make a table for it but I would guess at least 5x the purchase price. Loans are banks way of taking your money.  Take them if you must but avoid them if you can.  Unless you can pay that thing back ASAP you are burning money that you could use to loan out to others who do not understand it.  Banks do. This would just be stealing your equity.   Never take such a loan.

How about abolishing property taxes for starters, then nuking the Fed since they can't do their jobs worth a flying fuck. Longer mortgages makes as much sense as reducing drug dosage to keep a patient suffering longer. permalink parent award report block reply Cetera -9 points 4 days ago Property taxes are a very GOOD thing. They provide a sink that makes it a huge disincentive for corporations or non-productive community members to squat on property and stifle/kill the community. Property taxes are moral and just. Indeed, they may be the most moral and just taxes, and they are one of the best means of taxing a populace for the good of the community. To start with, property taxes have been around for 5,000 years now. They're one of the oldest taxes known. They've proven historically and traditionally to be worth the cost they impose upon landowners because the benefits are so high and because the benefits are required for a community to survive. Property taxes are also biblical. They're part of Leviticus and non-optional. Communities require property to exist at all and in order to survive. Locking away that property in private ownership can still benefit the community and help the community to survive if the benefit to the community is greater under private ownership than in public or communal ownership. To that end, landowners have always had a duty and a responsibility to the community. Throughout history, this has taken many forms, but it has always existed. Failure to meet your duties and responsibilities to the community as a landowner, and your land was taken from you by force and given to someone else who would meet them. This has been considered just for time immemorial. This is wrapped up in the concept of noblesse oblige but also in others throughout history. Landowners in our country at its founding had responsibilities to the body politic in terms of governance, but they had financial responsibilities as well. All of them paid property taxes. Property taxes are also always inherently local. There is no national property tax, no federal property tax. They're assessed locally, they're collected locally, and they're spent locally. In probably 99% of the areas in this country, a group of coordinated voters of no more than 1,000 individuals could likely completely control every aspect of property taxes in their locality, and in perhaps 50% of the country as few as a hundred or two citizens could do so. If you live in an urban metro area, yeah, you're not going to be able to influence property tax policy much. That's part of the cost of living in an urban area. But for the vast majority, they absolutely can. There's no nonsense about taxation without representation. If you have a problem with the way your taxes are assessed, collected, or spent, you can do something about it. Finally, the primary benefit of property taxes isn't that they fund local community spending on whatever the community decides to spend it on. The primary benefit of property taxes is keeping property available for the common individual to have the opportunity to purchase. Without property taxes, it would be vastly easier for wealthy individuals, organizations, and conglomerates to buy up land and squat on it. Land is a finite resource. More isn't going to be made, even as the population has continued to grow across the planet. One person or family owning land deprives anyone else of owning that land, and not all land is created equally. Some land is much more valuable than other land, either due to water availability, natural beauty, or other resources. Locking up land in perpetual, essentially \"free\" ownership does an injustice to the rest of the public and certainly to future generations. Property taxes provide a \"sink\" that forces a certain level of utility to the land. This does benefit the community. It also means that retired people without income have to come up with a way to pay their property taxes. That sucks, but that is part and parcel of owning land. If you can't afford it in perpetuity, you can't afford it. You can sell it, you can rent it out, you can give it to your offspring and let them pay for it and put you up on it, or whatever. But property taxes are inherently a good thing, even though they suck having to pay. It seems to me that most people that are against property taxes in all forms have misguided notions and tend toward libertarian ideals, and they lack experience in human nature or haven't pursued the logical ends fully enough. They may also be seeking license, confusing that with freedom, and attempting to have their free lunch. We gotta remember TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Leviticus 27:30-33: \"Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the Lord's; it is holy to the Lord. If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the Lord.\" Leviticus 25:23-24: \"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\" 1 Chronicles 29:14-16: \"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly?

Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.

Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\" Matthew 22:17-21: \"Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.\" And they brought him a denarius.

We also paid additional money every month on the mortgage to get out of debt faster. We also refinanced when interest rates dropped and started paying even more money every month to reduce the principle. We paid off our 30 year mortgage off in just over 20 years.

Automation in construction. Relaxation of code laws that inflate construction costs for little real value. Also, lets de-stigmatize the idea of living at home with parents. If you can live at home rent free for your first 3-5 years after entering the job market, it's not hard to save $60,000 or more to use as a substantial down payment. permalink parent award report block reply Taylor3006 10 points 4 days ago A big down payment is the most important thing you can do when buying a house. Back when we bought, we were required to have 20% down. We kept saving past that and ended up buying a cheaper home than we planned so our down payment ended up being nearly 35% of the purchase price. We also paid additional money every month on the mortgage to get out of debt faster. We also refinanced when interest rates dropped and started paying even more money every month to reduce the principle. We paid off our 30 year mortgage off in just over 20 years. The savings were substantial between the big down payment (so smaller loan amount) and paying off some of the principle by overpaying starting with our first payment. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 10 points 4 days ago I think the multigenerational home is the next step.

That's what happens when you go from a high-trust society to a low-trust society and people are required to spend more time indoors in their houses for recreation and entertainment because the streets aren't safe for the kids to play in, nor for you to be out and about on alone. It is also what happens in a gig-economy when people need their homes to double as office space for home businesses, or working remotely.

That is the only thing that will correct the imbalance of supply vs demand. There are so many upsides to doing this and zero downside.

I think the main reason Trump is floating the 50 year mortgage as a potential solution is because of debt to income ratios. A lot of potential homeowners are gated out even if they have the savings for a down payment because the DTI requirements a lot of lenders ask disqualify them. With 50 year mortgages, the lower monthly principals mean that a lot of the younger citizens can qualify, and if they pay principals that match a 30 year mortgage, that means they get a 30 year mortgage without getting disqualified because of inane requirements.

A 50 year loan does not mandate that it must be paid over 50 years exactly. For example, you could just pay it off faster and do it in 30, resulting in the current system, or you have the option to go longer. I'm not disputing anything about interest rates, but I'm saying that if you take our exact system now but give the option for 50 year loans, isn't that just a net improvement to the consumers because it gives poorer people an option to buy? Also, doing this doesn't mean we can't also reduce costs for building. If anything, this tweet tells us that he is aware of the housing issues and is throwing out ideas to see what works and what doesn't. We might see a large plan in a few weeks that includes this and a lot of other ideas to help home buying. Edit: let me add that I'm assuming no pre paid penalty, which the real estate lawyer next to me is saying they would typically not do in these kinds of loans. permalink award report block reply corporateshizer 2 points 4 days ago The negativity comes from us wanting a government that actually fixes the problems the government created, like the immigration crisis, instead of creating new problems with their 'fixes.'

Do I think this solves everything? No, and I'm sure the President would agree. But what everyone has lost me on is why they claim this is somehow making the situation worse. I have not seen a single argument as to how this will make people less likely to buy a house. All of the interest rate arguments are silly because you only lose money renting! 50 years of interest is about what you would spend actually to rent a place of probably worse quality for 50 years straight. And typically rent agreements are not 50 years, so expect your rent to go up while a fixed-rate mortgage could save you money instead! permalink parent award report block reply corporateshizer 1 points 4 days ago It would make people interested in regular mortgages less likely to buy a house because prices would increase from the increase in demand.

One member was a real estate lawyer for a very large company who warned many people about the problems with those types of loans then. The main problem was that the loan gave you an option to pay less interest in a given payment, but the missing interest was applied to the principle. Financially illiterate people did this, and eventually they racked up impossible amounts of debt. Nothing like that is being discussed here, and I would hope to never see those types of loans again. As for supply and demand, that doesn't work well as an argument because I can claim the inverse hypothetical that builders will be spurred on by money and growth to make more houses to match the rising demand. More people will move to newer houses, freeing up cheaper ones that poorer people can buy. The proof is in the many housing bubbles and booms throughout history in many countries. Lastly, your whole use of \"regular\" or \"American\" are just subjective, emotional appeals. What makes 30 vs 50 any more \"American\"???

Factor in inflation (the amount you borrow in 2025 is going to be worth a lot less in 2075), the fact that people often sell and move before they pay off 100%, and the deductibility of interest on home mortgages, this isn't a bad deal. permalink award report block reply julianReyes 2 points 4 days ago I can REALLY tell this \"secretly red\" comment section is being raided by Retardittors because they don't know the first thing about owning a home (cough cough \"omfg I can NEVER refinance my home later on with 50 year mortgages!!11!!\"). permalink parent award report block reply lizardo221 1 points 4 days ago Take my up vote, I have but only 1 to give!

If the housing prices remained \"low\", over time from 20 your wage should jump up, hopefully and if you are smart will make more payments heading off interest. Of course, this is not how our system has worked.  Banks and investors will tweak the market to jack up home prices and interest rates to dickbag levels.  Instead of paying a $1500 mortgage for 30 years, you'll just be paying $1500 for 50 years.  Initially, this will help affordability, but over time it will become another crippling monster.

I don't see how people will ever be able to come up with a down-payment that will free them from mortgage insurance when they can't afford to buy their first home otherwise, and won't be able to build equity.

Purpose. The traditional 15-, 30-, and 50-year mortgage model has contributed to unsustainable household debt, predatory lending practices, and housing market volatility. To empower American families with greater flexibility, lower entry barriers, and reduced long-term financial risk, this Order establishes a national framework prioritizing home leasing as the default residential housing mechanism over mortgage-based ownership. Section 2. Definitions. (a) \u201cHome Leasing\u201d means a renewable lease agreement for a primary residence with fixed monthly payments, no down payment requirement, included maintenance, and an option to vacate or relocate without penalty after a minimum term of 12 months. (b) \u201cMortgage-Based Ownership\u201d means any secured loan tied to real property with terms exceeding 10 years. Section 3. Federal Policy Shift. (a) Effective January 1, 2027 , all new federally backed housing programs (including FHA, VA, and USDA loans) shall cease offering mortgage products and instead provide Home Leasing Guarantees backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. (b) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall establish the National Home Leasing Corporation (NHLC) , a public-private entity tasked with: Converting existing mortgage-backed securities into lease-backed securities. Offering landlords tax credits for capping lease rates at 25% of median area income. Guaranteeing lease portability nationwide (a lessee in Ohio may transfer their lease to an equivalent unit in Texas without credit re-qualification). Section 4. Mortgage Phase-Out. (a) No new 15-, 30-, or 50-year mortgages shall be originated after December 31, 2028 . (b) Existing mortgages may be voluntarily converted to NHLC leases at a 1:1 payment ratio with principal forgiveness for underwater borrowers. (c) The Federal Reserve shall adjust monetary policy to prioritize lease-backed securities over mortgage-backed securities in its balance sheet. Section 5. Protections and Incentives. (a) Rent-to-Own Opt-Out : Lessees may accrue up to 20% of lease payments toward a future down payment, redeemable only if they exit the program. (b) Eviction Moratorium : Landlords participating in NHLC leases are prohibited from eviction except for non-payment exceeding 90 days or felony activity. (c) Corporate Landlord Cap : No single entity may control more than 5% of NHLC lease units in any metropolitan statistical area. Section 6. Implementation. (a) The Secretary of HUD, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall issue regulations within 180 days . (b) A National Lease Registry shall track all NHLC units, ensuring transparency and preventing price gouging via blockchain-based smart contracts. Section 7. General Provisions. (a) This Order supersedes any conflicting federal regulation. (b) If any provision is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect.

It would be impossible to underwrite a 50-yr home mortgage without government insurance against default. There will either be a collapse in home prices or a collapse in the value of the dollar. permalink award report block reply\nWharf_Rat 1 points 4 days ago Thats insane permalink award report block reply\nstargunner 1 points 4 days ago normalize lower rates and home prices first. permalink award report block reply\nRestoreMurica 1 points 4 days ago This is a terrible idea without massive reduction in interest rate permalink award report block reply\ncptkloss5 1 points 4 days ago lol... how about you get a mortgage the day you're born, automatically with the last payment the minute you die? permalink award report block reply\nneomt 1 points 4 days ago No, it's not \"great\".  But this is probably the current best alternative to owning nothing and being happy with it. The current option for 35% of all Americans is paying someone else's mortgage (or blackrock) via rent and owning nothing, and they pay 35-50% of their income to do so. This will only work with when you combine it with kicking 20M illegals out of the country to lower housing prices, and banning investment companies from owning single family homes. permalink award report block reply\nCaJuN-Polak 1 points 4 days ago Well ... if he can get the interest percentages way down, like 1% or less, then 50yrs won't be bad .... but still a bad idea to have a loan out that far. I won't take a car loan out for more than 48mos. permalink award report block reply E-dantes 3 points 4 days ago Are you retarded too?

Fuck off! permalink parent award report block reply CaJuN-Polak 1 points 3 days ago My comment was assuming lowered interest rates.

The issue is the high interest rates, and how ridiculous prices are. permalink award report block reply\nVladtheTickler 1 points 4 days ago Well, there is also the option of making principal-only payments in addition to the monthly mortgage payment.  So, one doesn't have to take 50 years to pay off a house. If I was in the market now, I would be leery of buying a new home as i don't think most of the ones going up today are built to last.  So, forty years from now, one could still be making payments on a house that fell to pieces after 25 years. permalink award report block reply\nRocksCanOnlyWait 1 points 4 days ago Or we could just let the free market decide what works best. Get the government out of the way: reduce zoning restrictions (a local issue) and end rent control / low income housing (also a local issue). Cut the federal budget so that we don't have constant inflation from government printing money so that young people can save for a house. permalink award report block reply\nOvertaxed 1 points 4 days ago Can new trucks and cars be far behind? permalink award report block reply\nHusky 1 points 4 days ago People are already doing this with campers.

People would get a lot by having the loan paid, but housing prices would collapse, which is likely good. permalink award report block reply\nyounglion11 0 points 4 days ago This is just further funding banks with long interest payments.

My target audience is people who pay 2k in rent for the last 10 years but can't get approved for a 2K mortgage.   Many such cases.  This would make the payment like 1400 or something so the bank is satisfied you can pay it, but nothing is stopping you from paying 2k.

You gain equity, you gain house value appreciation.  You can sell the fucking thing, you can refinance it... a mortgage isn't some blood bound magical contract. And it's incredibly likely that the mortgage payment (even WITH taxes, insurance etc. included) is less than your rent. Truly owning nothing means YOU RENT.  Which is exactly what the people that would take these loans do right now. permalink award report block reply\nNamendaBiden 0 points 4 days ago Im ok with it.  50 year should carry a lower interest rate vs 30 and rounding up the payment to the nearest hundred could easily shave a decade off the length of the loan. Plus, buying is the hard part.  Once you own the house, refinance into a 30,20,15, or 10 year mortgage when interest rates are low. permalink award report block reply E-dantes 1 points 4 days ago It's called rent that you'll never pay off, now with property taxes!!
