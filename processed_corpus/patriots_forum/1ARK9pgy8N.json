McLeod, and became a major hit, topping the charts for ten weeks and later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame The 1936 film, starring Bing Crosby, Madge Evans, and Edith Fellows, follows Larry Poole, a man released from prison on a false charge, who fulfills a dying inmate's request to help a family named Smith, only to discover they are a young girl and her elderly grandfather in need  The story centers on themes of hope and redemption, underscored by the film's memorable musical numbers, including the title song The phrase was later adapted into a groundbreaking British television drama series titled Pennies from Heaven , which debuted on 7 March 1978, written by Dennis Potter  The series, set in 1930s Britain, followed the struggles of sheet-music salesman Arthur Parker, using contemporary songs to contrast the bleak reality of the Great Depression with the characters' fantasies  The series was critically acclaimed, winning a BAFTA for Most Original Series and launching the career of Bob Hoskins This BBC series inspired a 1981 American film adaptation titled Pennies from Heaven , directed by Herbert Ross and written by Dennis Potter, which relocated the story to Depression-era Chicago  The film stars Steve Martin as Arthur Parker, Bernadette Peters as schoolteacher Eileen, and Christopher Walken as a pimp  The film features surreal musical sequences where characters lip-sync and dance to 1920s\u201330s hits like \"Let's Misbehave\" and \"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries,\" juxtaposing the characters' grim realities with their dreamlike fantasies  While the film received positive critical reception, it was a box office failure, grossing only a fraction of its budget, and earned three Academy Award nominations without winning The 1981 film has since gained a cult following for its unique blend of drama, musical fantasy, and social commentary, with its themes of escapism and the destructive nature of illusion resonating with audiences  The phrase has also inspired fictional abilities in fan-created content, such as the power to summon and hurl coins with superhuman speed, often tied to the idea of \"pennies from heaven\" as a metaphor for unexpected fortune permalink award report block reply lostmyoldpassword 1 points 7 minutes ago Jesus Christ, I'm gonna see this cartoon until the end of time - with various bubbles over her head vaguely blaming \"boomers\" for all of the worlds ills.
