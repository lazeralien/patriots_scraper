He believes most loans are structured where interest strictly reflects the remaining principle, i.e., if you pay a 50 year like it is a 30 year, the amount of interest you pay in total will be the same. However, some loans have interest that pretends the principle is as was originally planned. You can pay principle to end the loan sooner, but the interest will behave like nothing special has happened until the principle is payed in full and the loan is done.
