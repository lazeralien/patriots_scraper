The democrat controlled leftist states have been issuing MILLIONS of licenses to illegal aliens, registering them to vote, and then using those names to cast fraudulent ballots. permalink award report block reply reallyrural OP 2 points 2 hours ago New restrictions have led to a scramble at Greater Portland Metro, which halted a training program coordinated by Portland Adult Education and said more than 10% of its drivers are at risk of losing their commercial licenses. A new federal rule restricting who can hold commercial driver\u2019s licenses is sending ripple effects through parts of Maine\u2019s transportation industry \u2014 and threatening to undo years of progress that some Greater Portland agencies have made to build a stable, diverse workforce.\nThe emergency order, issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration at the end of September, limits commercial driver\u2019s license eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and noncitizens holding one of three specific visas.\nFor everyone else \u2014 including asylum seekers, participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and other immigrants who have work authorization but not those specific visas \u2014 the door to a CDL has effectively closed.\n\u201cIt used to be that if you had eligibility to work in the state, you could obtain a CDL,\u201d said Glenn Fenton, executive director of Greater Portland Metro. \u201cNow the federal government has put forth these requirements, and it\u2019s having a real impact.\u201d\nFenton estimates that 160-200 people in Maine could lose their licenses as a result of the change, while hundreds more will be ineligible to apply for CDLs at all.\nA lawsuit challenging the emergency order says the change could affect 200,000 workers nationwide. Earlier this week, the federal appeals court hearing the case temporarily paused implementation of the new restrictions, but a final decision could be months or even years away.\nSENSE OF UNCERTAINTY\nGreater Portland Metro, which operates bus service across the region, employs about 80 bus drivers. Ten of those workers were affected when the rule initially went into effect this fall. One has since obtained a green card, but the rest are still at risk of losing their commercial licenses.\n\u201cThose nine operators make up more than 10% of our workforce,\u201d Fenton said.\nFenton said Metro has been in contact with the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which confirmed that existing licenses will remain valid until each driver\u2019s renewal date. The renewal schedule stretches over the next four years, meaning some drivers could be affected as soon as early 2026, while others will be able to continue working longer.\nRelated\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\nMaine will resettle only 50 refugees this year, all white South Africans\t\nMeanwhile, a DACA recipient, an asylum seeker and two large unions have sued the federal government over the changes, accusing the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of circumventing the normal rulemaking process. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in October, alleges that the Trump administration has failed to prove that the changes must be implemented on an emergency basis.\nOn Monday, two of the three federal circuit court judges in the case issued an administrative stay, effectively pausing the changes as the case continues.\nFor now, with that uncertainty surrounding the final outcome of the changes, Metro is trying to find other roles within the transit agency for its nine affected workers \u2014 even if they wind up no longer being able to drive commercial vehicles. Some positions at Metro do not require CDLs, but those roles pay less, Fenton said.\nPIPELINE INTERUPTED\nOne of the most immediate impacts of the change has been the collapse of a successful recruitment program that Metro had built alongside Portland Adult Education, which helped connect newly arrived immigrants with training for commercial driving.\nThat program provided a clear path: Students studied for their CDL permit, learned the written material, then connected with Metro for hands-on training and job placement. It became a cornerstone of the transit agency\u2019s hiring efforts.\n\u201cBefore we had that program, we were chronically understaffed,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cSince it\u2019s been in place, we\u2019ve been able to fill all of our vacant spots, and we\u2019ve been really happy with who we\u2019ve hired through that.\u201d\nRelated\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\nH-1B visa\u2019s $100,000 price hike leaves Maine employers worried about impact\t\nAbbie Yamamoto, executive director of Portland Adult Education, said that when the new federal rule came down, the school canceled its CDL classes for the fall.\n\u201cIt has been devastating for some who had seen this as a frontal investment for a better wage and way of life,\u201d Yamamoto said in an email Wednesday.\nWhile Yamamoto is confident that the affected students will find other work and that the CDL class will return after some retooling, she says the change will still have a negative impact on Maine\u2019s economy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the institutions \u2026 and the larger economy that will suffer from a significantly reduced pool of willing and able applicants,\u201d Yamamoto said.\nFenton echoed that, nothing that the steady flow of workers that Metro and Portland Adult Ed had worked together to build has been stymied.\n\u201cThere will still be some folks coming through,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not in the numbers they were before.\u201d\nFenton said Metro plans to keep hiring through the program as long as applicants\u2019 immigration statuses fit the new regulations. Noncitizens who hold H-2A visas for temporary agricultural workers, H-2B visas for seasonal nonagricultural workers or E-2 visas for treaty investors are still able to acquire CDLs, regardless of whether the rule is upheld by the courts.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to hire anyone who\u2019s eligible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I get the impression there will be fewer people coming through.\u201d\nCity of Portland spokesperson Jessica Grondin said the change hasn\u2019t yet impacted any commercial drivers employed by the city, such as snowplow and school bus drivers.\n\u2018A MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION\u2019\nMaine immigrant advocates say the impact of the rule extends to immigrants all over the state and will likely have a outsized impact on truck drivers.\nRuben Torres, policy and advocacy manager with the Maine Immigrants\u2019 Rights Coalition, said the change imposes another hurdle for newly arrived immigrants trying to find work.\n\u201cImmigrants are here and taking positions to improve their communities and build a life for themselves,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWith this policy change, you\u2019re limiting folks from being able to contribute and stopping them from filling gaps in our workforce that are huge needs for our state.\u201d\nTorres said the coalition hopes to work with Maine lawmakers in the next legislative session to expand workforce training in other fields.\nRelated\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\nAs Trump ends DEI efforts, Maine conference helps businesses increase diversity hiring\t\nFor Fenton, the change is frustrating. After years of workforce instability, Metro had finally achieved steady staffing levels \u2014 only to see that progress put at risk by a decision far beyond the agency\u2019s control.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a move in the wrong direction when we had made some strides in the right direction,\u201d he said.\nFenton said representatives from Metro recently traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak with congressional representatives about the change, but it became clear legislation may not be a feasible fix.\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging because we\u2019re a little bit helpless here in terms of affecting change,\u201d he said. permalink award report block reply Wizard_Glick 1 points 2 hours ago Thank you I can't read... permalink parent award report block reply sleepinggiant 1 points 12 minutes ago Pukes treating this like a slight against the drivers permalink award report block reply PatriotDescendant -1 points 2 hours ago Who the fuck is gonna' read that wall of text.
