If you can't afford it, there are several states in the USA that allow you to allocate your kids' public school funding to a parochial school. Move there. Or die on your knees and let the government raise your kids. permalink parent award report block reply Get_Off_Big_Tech 14 points 5 days ago Religious schools give better odds, but they still need to be monitored by the parents. I agree that moving should be considered to give kids a better life. permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 1 points 4 days ago religious Christian. Substituting \"religious\" for \"Christian\" has led to a lot of confusion, and damage to humanity. Everyone has a religion. One big devastating thing is the pretense that the terms \"Christian\" and \"religion/religious\" are interchangeable. Ever wonder why only Christianity is interchanged?? When you say \"religion\" people assume Christianity. Not islam, buddism, atheism, agnosticism, nope!! ONLY Christianity gets this kind of confusion aimed at it. How curious. Almost as if Christianity is true and wicked people want to muddy waters by switching Christianity with the vague umbrella term \"religion\". What we need is BIBLICAL CHRISTIANITY. Not vague, unnamed, generic, \"religion\". permalink parent award report block reply Ch3f4554551n 3 points 5 days ago We teach at home. Just teach your kids where and how to learn, then encourage them and provide a structure. Humans teach themselves until they are put in an environment where they are either prevented from doing so, or are crushed psychologically to the point where they give up...like public schools. permalink parent award report block reply N14205ST205 2 points 5 days ago I desperately needed homeschooling when I was in K-12. I finally got it in the form of online college classes I took in my bedroom. It was a proving ground for me to put the skills managing time, resources, and strategies in the video games I have always loved playing- and; the ideas I gained from seeing the strengths of different ideas and ingenuity approaches in every kind of motorsports imaginable, to use. Those online college classes were the best academic years of my life. I made the Dean's List, got to understand the material in a way that let me connect it to my interests plus burgeoning MAGA and Trump support, and finally got to do work I was proud of because I could do it my way at my own pace. Examples come in the form of assignments where we commented on current events. I used them to explain why I thought MAGA and anti globalism ideas were better, even if that meant I couldn't do them the easy way and had to work harder. My teachers actually praised my conviction and detail and appreciated how my enthusiasm showed in my work. On the other hand, my K-12 schools (all private, religious, and in person) left me with severe trust issues, bad memories of a Dangerous Minds like gauntlet of status and chaos (I was literally the closest thing to a nerd in my 6th-8th grade school. Yes I was bullied for it, but the class wide punishments were what bothered me- I was proud that a bunch of youths, as this site defines them, didn't like me), a near lethal mental health crisis, and a deeply fractured family dynamic. They were awful. The kids were so disrespectful and prone to things like getting into fights or destroying and throwing property that the teachers were really heavy handed in their approaches to discipline. It felt like a warzone. I was so scared of getting in trouble and was so disgusted by my peers that I didn't talk at all at school for a decade unless it was to a teacher. I knew from the moment I started kindergarten that I was fundamentally incompatibile with the school environment. Over 12 years, I never felt at home at any of my schools. That's just half of it. Don't worry, I got better. Point is, there are some kids out there who really do need some kind of homeschooling or independent study so they can channel energy they'd otherwise spend trying to survive into delving deep into their passions, using them to understand other things in the world, and end up with a genuine growth journey that empowers them to chase their dreams and tap into potential that would otherwise be dormant if they were trapped in a traditional school environment. I am no longer in the K-12 school system and have successfully earned my degree and now have a fulfilling career. Nonetheless, it means a great deal for me to see others at least have the option to pursue something like homeschooling, if only so that they don't have to go through what I did. permalink parent award report block reply thisguy883 1 points 5 days ago My children were in a religious school until it closed down for lack of funding. The next closest school with the same religious affiliation, is an hour drive. Now we have them in a charter school that follows the same values, but without the religious overtones. permalink parent award report block reply MAGABOND 3 points 5 days ago Especially if the mom doesn\u2019t have a fucking job, like my coworkers wife. permalink parent award report block reply Yaemz123 1 points 5 days ago I sent my son to public school. I also taught him critical thinking skills, watched very carefully all that the teachers taught, and worked with him throughout school on both his homework and advised him on social interactions. He learned about bullying, dealing with incompetent people placed in positions of authority over him, peer pressure, comformity vs non-conformity, when to push back vs when to bide his time, etc. As an involved parent, I believe the negatives of life during public school are some of the most important things children can learn, PROVIDED they have competent and supportive parents. A tree that is well watered grows deeper roots by enduring the storms of life. permalink parent award report block reply BlippiIsAPedo 1 points 5 days ago Cant do everything yourself.

I had considered using Calvert, but even 20+ years ago, it was quite expensive. To make sure there were no issues when applying to college, I enrolled my daughter in Penn Foster\u2019s high school program. It\u2019s regionally accredited, affordable, and relatively easy to complete.

I finally got it in the form of online college classes I took in my bedroom. It was a proving ground for me to put the skills managing time, resources, and strategies in the video games I have always loved playing- and; the ideas I gained from seeing the strengths of different ideas and ingenuity approaches in every kind of motorsports imaginable, to use. Those online college classes were the best academic years of my life. I made the Dean's List, got to understand the material in a way that let me connect it to my interests plus burgeoning MAGA and Trump support, and finally got to do work I was proud of because I could do it my way at my own pace. Examples come in the form of assignments where we commented on current events. I used them to explain why I thought MAGA and anti globalism ideas were better, even if that meant I couldn't do them the easy way and had to work harder. My teachers actually praised my conviction and detail and appreciated how my enthusiasm showed in my work. On the other hand, my K-12 schools (all private, religious, and in person) left me with severe trust issues, bad memories of a Dangerous Minds like gauntlet of status and chaos (I was literally the closest thing to a nerd in my 6th-8th grade school. Yes I was bullied for it, but the class wide punishments were what bothered me- I was proud that a bunch of youths, as this site defines them, didn't like me), a near lethal mental health crisis, and a deeply fractured family dynamic. They were awful. The kids were so disrespectful and prone to things like getting into fights or destroying and throwing property that the teachers were really heavy handed in their approaches to discipline. It felt like a warzone. I was so scared of getting in trouble and was so disgusted by my peers that I didn't talk at all at school for a decade unless it was to a teacher. I knew from the moment I started kindergarten that I was fundamentally incompatibile with the school environment. Over 12 years, I never felt at home at any of my schools. That's just half of it. Don't worry, I got better. Point is, there are some kids out there who really do need some kind of homeschooling or independent study so they can channel energy they'd otherwise spend trying to survive into delving deep into their passions, using them to understand other things in the world, and end up with a genuine growth journey that empowers them to chase their dreams and tap into potential that would otherwise be dormant if they were trapped in a traditional school environment. I am no longer in the K-12 school system and have successfully earned my degree and now have a fulfilling career.

It\u2019s regionally accredited, affordable, and relatively easy to complete. She finished the program in two years and was accepted to several state and private colleges (though not Ivy League schools). permalink parent award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 3 points 4 days ago Thank you for your informative response! permalink parent award report block reply\nRememberCharlieKirk 3 points 4 days ago Thank you for your informative response! permalink parent award report block reply\npedespeed 16 points 5 days ago your partner Me:  oh, you mean my Wife?
