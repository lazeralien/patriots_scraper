Christianity is belief in Christ, Grace through Christ's sacrifice. It's about forgiveness for sins, not using God's Law to condemn and destroy people. permalink award report block reply DCPower 9 points 3 days ago Condemnation involves execution. Pointing out something is wrong is not condemnation. When they brought the adulteress woman to Jesus, He didn\u2019t require her death, but He did tell her \u201cGo and sin no more.\u201d Nowadays people would tell Jesus He was wrong for saying she was sinning and to stop \u201ccondemning\u201d her. permalink parent award report block reply conservativefrank -1 points 3 days ago Show me someone who commits 0 sins. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard -1 points 3 days ago I'm tired of being told I'm a sinner when those people accused me of sinning sin way more than I do.

Look at that guy sinning! He's rotten!\" permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 1 points 3 days ago Hypocrisy much? permalink parent award report block reply conservativefrank -1 points 3 days ago It's a sin. The leftist committed it. It's wise to call it out, so people don't vote for him. However, by God, the leftist's sin receives the same forgiveness as my sins do and as your sins do. Accept the forgiveness and it's yours. permalink parent award report block reply DCPower 2 points 3 days ago That\u2019s just it, the leftist does not get forgiven because they claim \u201cthey have no sin\u201d, so the sin remains in them. permalink parent award report block reply conservativefrank 0 points 3 days ago Grace is for sinners. If you accept Grace, you're forgiven. Period. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nBldg_2019 66 points 3 days ago Yeah, check that faggot\u2019s hard drives. permalink award report block reply NotYourMan 8 points 3 days ago FAFO! permalink parent award report block reply MAGA9428 -6 points 3 days ago Why?
