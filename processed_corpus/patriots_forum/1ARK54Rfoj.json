He basically gave the Democrats their October surprise, knowing there was no way in Hell that would pass with a Democrat Senate, and basically scaring every single moderate and independent in to voting for the Democrats. The only reason you'd do that when he did it was to sabotage the races for Republicans during that midterm.

AND they have Re-election committees in DC that will fight against primary chanllenges - and then NOT FUND YOU if you win in the Primary - and basically re-primary YOU ASAP... again with MILLIONS of Dollars. Taking out these players is SUPER HEAVY LIFTING... it is absolutely a Blood Sport - MAGA needs ELON to come in help remove some of the worst... it really is the only way. permalink award report block reply RuprechtThaMonkeyBoy 17 points 5 days ago We learned this in 2020.

Some special interests will never support our cause but with some compromising and negotiating, hopefully crafting win-win situations, we can pluck some of their support and they'll go along to get along. permalink parent award report block reply MastaJoda 1 points 5 days ago \u261dHis source is the last 30 years. permalink parent award report block reply boomerbutnotOKBoomer 3 points 5 days ago McStain butt buddy. there. fixed it for ya permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 3 points 5 days ago More Republicans need to learn to become scrappy. The biggest problem with Republicans, I think, is that the communists know how to live in poverty. They know that if they get evicted, it's not the end of the world for them. A Republican thinks that if he were to miss a mortgage payment that he is in danger. If a Republican worries that if he hasn't acquired $5M in a retirement fund by 65 that he's fucked. The Republicans are therefore always chasing money. The communists know this and so they find ways to print money to pay off the Republicans. It's not cheap to buy a Republican, but it's a safe purchase. They will rely on your money the rest of their life, and they will treat you like family the entire time you pay them. In this way, they are grateful. A communist, however, wants a grand purpose, and then they will take a small pittance. For communists, they will steal and backstab as soon as the grand purpose sputters, even if you are still paying them. But the solution is just to keep them at a distance. You can rent them a derelict warehouse to organize in, and then you can have a union boss be the liason. Republicans, the motto is \"pull yourselves up by your boot straps\", which means \"every man for themselves\". The communist motto is \"strength in unity\" which means \"all for the collective good\". This is changing in Trump Republicanism, but this is why we can't seem to primary anyone. And the establishment likes it that way. You are alone because the culture wants you that way. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Read Acts 2. permalink parent award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 2 points 5 days ago A Republican worries that if he hasn't acquired $5M in a retirement fund by 65 that he's fucked. NO. A Republican worries that if he hasn't acquired $5M in a retirement fund by 65 his family is fucked. I'm over 50.  At this point, I'm not working for me.  I'm accumulating wealth so that my family - including brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews - is taken care of after I die, and so that I can help them out a little while I'm alive. That's the difference.  Leftists only care about themselves and their wants (you notice I did not say needs ). The communist motto is \"strength in unity\" Wrong again. The communist motto is \"by any means necessary.\"  Commies are willing to do whatever it takes to prevail.  See:  Antifa, BLM, election fraud, the filibuster.  Republicans aren't even willing to prosecute these crimes. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Your whole family rides on your back, financially? Are you black? The communist motto is what they motivate each other with. They aren't motivated by their means. They are motivated by their desired ends. I can tell that you are certainly motivated by means, but it's because you think your world critically depends on you. If that was true, Americans wouldn't join the military or become police officers. I'm just going to advise you to seek the Lord Jesus Christ just as the Americans who made this country great. permalink parent award report block reply noPTSDforMePlease 2 points 5 days ago Replace one group of billionaires with another.

The GOP would pull all funding for you during the real election saying \"not worth the effort\" Or other shit like they did down in Arizona. They will purposely ignore you, and help the democrats take your seat. They are uniparty faggots through and through. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 4 points 5 days ago That\u2019s like 99% of Republican politicians, to be fair to Miss Lindsey. permalink award report block reply ILoveSilk 3 points 5 days ago Abortion, gun right, is used by them to get re elected. permalink award report block reply Repentnow 2 points 5 days ago Babies, Bullets, Bible.\nGOP safe space. permalink parent award report block reply ILoveSilk 3 points 5 days ago so sad.

If they can't elect a king to solve all their problems, then they might as well live the rest of their lives as hedonistic retirees because the system is coming to an end.

NO. A Republican worries that if he hasn't acquired $5M in a retirement fund by 65 his family is fucked. I'm over 50.  At this point, I'm not working for me.  I'm accumulating wealth so that my family - including brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews - is taken care of after I die, and so that I can help them out a little while I'm alive. That's the difference.  Leftists only care about themselves and their wants (you notice I did not say needs ). The communist motto is \"strength in unity\" Wrong again. The communist motto is \"by any means necessary.\"  Commies are willing to do whatever it takes to prevail.  See:  Antifa, BLM, election fraud, the filibuster.  Republicans aren't even willing to prosecute these crimes. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Your whole family rides on your back, financially? Are you black? The communist motto is what they motivate each other with. They aren't motivated by their means. They are motivated by their desired ends. I can tell that you are certainly motivated by means, but it's because you think your world critically depends on you. If that was true, Americans wouldn't join the military or become police officers. I'm just going to advise you to seek the Lord Jesus Christ just as the Americans who made this country great. permalink parent award report block reply\nsordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Your whole family rides on your back, financially?

The GOP would pull all funding for you during the real election saying \"not worth the effort\" Or other shit like they did down in Arizona. They will purposely ignore you, and help the democrats take your seat. They are uniparty faggots through and through. permalink parent award report block reply\nPrussian_Pepe 4 points 5 days ago Even if you somehow DID win the primary.

If they can't elect a king to solve all their problems, then they might as well live the rest of their lives as hedonistic retirees because the system is coming to an end. I guess we did have some scrappy Republicans over at TPUSA, but their leader was killed, and now the organization is led by money. permalink award report block reply\nBidensfullAFdiaper 3 points 5 days ago Troof permalink award report block reply\nI_Love_45-70_Gov 3 points 5 days ago Susan Collins always votes her \"conscience\" on major legislation that fucks over Americans...always. permalink award report block reply\nboomerbutnotOKBoomer 3 points 5 days ago Ukraine is the money laundering and child sex trafficking capital of the world.
