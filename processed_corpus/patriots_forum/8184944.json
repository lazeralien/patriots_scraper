So, ZERO and I mean ZERO US federal funding for international students. permalink parent award report block reply tt777 6 points 10 hours ago Those 600,000 will be able to build things like the bridge that collapsed in China. permalink award report block reply champdog OP 2 points 8 hours ago Hell of a deal i say.
