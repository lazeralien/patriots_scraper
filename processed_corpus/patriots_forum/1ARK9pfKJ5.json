Do you have a favorite seller, some quick tips and techniques? In return, I'll leave a useful perspective for those who don't understand what's happening. Silver is increasing in value above the stock market. When that happens, historically, it is my understanding that there is fear in the population and a general belief that bad times are coming - and those bad times tend to happen, historically. The reason the price is increasing so much is that once that threshold is crossed, where the silver is more valuable than the market, people talk more about it and it is generally understood that things have gone from speculation to general feeling in the population. Inviduals can be stupid, but sometimes in large numbers, they can make fairly smart/educated decisions - sometimes. So it snowballs, more people talk about it, more people take it seriously, more people buy silver, the price rises. Now... will you lose your shirt if you invest now? Possibly. In your lifetime, the silver may not return to the price you bought it. But, if that silver stays in the family or you live another 50 years, chances are good it'll return to this value. Or, you could see it going even higher and never return to this value because our currency is so devalued. permalink parent award report block reply ViagraFalls 10 points 8 hours ago The first thing you need to understand about metals is the buyer/seller dynamic exists. If you sell your used car to a dealership, they might give you $1000 for it. Then you might find that they sold it for $1500-2000. Of course, you could sell your car to a person instead and get $1500. When dealing with metal dealers they are in the position of seller and you are in the position of buyer. With metals, I think people are paranoid about getting scammed, so they don\u2019t like to buy from other people. Aside from this if you buy a substantial amount, you will probably want insurance on it, which is an additional cost and a scam. I heard they just automatically reject all claims. So if your $15,000 worth of metals disappears in shipping, you\u2019ll have to be starting a lawsuit. I would only recommend buying metals if you think a major currency crash (hyperinflation) will happen. The prophet that predicted Trump getting shot in the ear also said there will be a currency crash and USD will be replaced by the Amero for the US, Mexico, and Canada. If you have enough cash to buy 10 horses, but buy metals instead, when you sell your metals, you\u2019ll probably have enough cash to buy 9 horses in whatever you get at the time. If the currency gets highly devalued, all the cash you kept will be enough to buy a pack of toilet paper instead of a horse. Ultimately, I think of buying metals as a way to preserve the value of money instead of a way to make money. The paper trading problem might prove me wrong about that. People (most likely ones with long crooked noses) came up with this idea of selling pieces of paper that say you have x amount of silver (or whatever metal). They\u2019re most likely selling 10 times as much silver than they have in stock. People will probably figure this out when it\u2019s too late and then they\u2019re just left with paper. This also enables the rich to manipulate the metal markets and keep the prices artificially low. Silver was around $45-48 in the 1980s. Some believe silver in the $20-25 range was artificial. If this whole scam collapses, the values of metals might shoot up to their proper values without manipulation going on making owning metals profitable even in terms of buying value. There is also the possibility of some new technology increasing the demand for a metal, but I wouldn\u2019t count on that happening. permalink parent award report block reply Thedaythe_redditdied 4 points 2 hours ago Excellent explanation I would like to point out one thing that you probably underestimated the paper silver sellers don\u2019t just give out 10 times paper what they have physical ( your local back actually does this with the US dollar. Yes they loan out 10 times more cash then they have) right now the paper to physically is 358 to 1. Meaning for every ounce of silver they have in thier vaults. They have sold 358 silver certificates for that one ounce. But wait you ask. What if I turn in my certificate and request the physical ounce be sent to me? If you ask for a couple ounces they might send you some. But if you ask for a lot. They will just send you a check in US dollars for the value of the silver  you supposedly own. Because you don\u2019t actually own the silver. A small tribe owns the silver and then lies to you and says it\u2019s yours and they will just keep it safe for you. Anyone interested in shiny rocks. you need to physically hold and control them your self or what you have is worth less than fiat cash. Silver or gold certificates are the second biggest scam going. After the US dollar. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... rextexMG 7 points 6 hours ago I buy direct from APMEX.com.

And don't listen to those here telling you that you might buy silver for $50 and sell it for $40.  That's bullshit.  Local shops near me will pay $1-$2 under spot price for it, sometimes right on spot.  You pay the premium when you buy it; at the moment silver is at $54 and APMEX is selling 1oz silver eagles for $62. Advice: avoid giant bars - they will be harder to sell.  5oz and 10oz are fine, but make sure the bars are a reputable known brand.  The best is to buy 1oz coins or rounds, they are easy to peel off and sell when you want to.  Don't buy fancy stuff, get the coins minted for each country: American silver eagles, Canadian maple leaf coins, UK Britannias, Austrian philharmonics, etc...

More simply, buy and sell price is on margin... So, if silver is 50$ it might be you buy for 50$ and sell for 40$. Also agreed that buying metals is more about preserving wealth than something like stocks where there's an expectation of stock price increasing above and beyond inflation. If you bought gold at 25$ and sold it at 100$, you can reasonably expect that the general costs for stuff will have gone up roughly proportional. The issue about the manipulation of prices is also true, and one of those rare moments where one could reasonably expect a real profit relative to inflation. I've heard arguments that gold prices SHOULD be trading at about 2-3x the prices at the time and silver, because of the industrial uses should be in the range of 5-10x the market. This isn't something worth counting on because if that music does stop and people buying gold and silver for 1-20k per oz, then there's going to be a lot more going on to worry about, and are just as likely to be facing a barter scenario. permalink parent award report block reply Meow4me2 1 points 4 hours ago We are buying for a local dealer (check with BBB for complaints) and looking to set up a gold IRA now to lock in some gains from the stock market. Local dealer - markup will likely be 1-2% higher than an online company, but you can usually buy in smaller portions, so easier to add a bit here or there. I found our dealer via an online search, checked reviews and BBB, then met before deciding to buy from him. Online dealer - minimum buys are higher, markups lower. We haven\u2019t gone this route because of worries over shipping \u201closses\u201d. I\u2019d rather pick it up directly myself from a local dealer. Precious metals IRA - Looking to move some money from an IRA overweighted in stocks to metals. IRA is physical metals held in a depository for us. Bonds are really underperforming, so looking at metals to preserve value. Have a gold ETF, but it behaves more like a stock. Stock market values so high, I\u2019m worried about a big correction.

You have to be able to buy the silver contract in full when you take delivery. Currently $270,000 for 1 contract.   Don\u2019t know too many people with quarter million dollars for 1 silver contract laying around.

These are the reason why we have all of those annoying ads about buying gold. People with money do not do this. permalink award report block reply sir_rockness 2 points 2 hours ago Yall go ahead and buy your silver and gold and jerk off to it at night and then when you die somebody can buy it at an estate auction. I'm gonna keep playing their shitty equity game and keep making 75, 125 or maybe 150% yearly on my US paper which will eventually be digital. permalink award report block reply AstroLonghorn 2 points 1 hour ago Why would I ever auction my silver when it has a tangible price and risk someone buying it at 70% its value? Estate sale more accurate. Also, some of us came from families where gold and silver were bought as something to pass on. It was intended to be sold 3/4 generations down the road\u2026 So yes enjoy your hypothetical come up when some families can sell all their precious metals and make in one day what you will make in multiple years and then live off the dividend. One more thing: you need physical silver for digital cash.

I have never had a problem getting melt value for my silver ever. Same with gold. Plenty of businesses who deal in scrap and coins will pay melt as the price goes up because so does the demand. They don't sell at melt you retard, they sell at spot plus a premium. If someone told you that they were not paying you spot, they were trying to fuck you because you seemed retarded to them. permalink parent award report block reply GETCHURbooztahh 0 points 8 hours ago Have you tried in the last few weeks? My buddys family owns cash carry jewelry stores. Not bullshit. They are turning away silver lately. Not gold. permalink parent award report block reply Taylor3006 2 points 8 hours ago Why the fuck would I sell at a jewelry store? That is like going to a pawn shop. Any town of any appreciable size will have coin dealers or silver/gold exchanges.  Larger cities will have scrap dealers that take precious metals and some of those companies will do mail in appraisals and offer you spot, easily. permalink parent award report block reply cjcivicx 1 points 44 minutes ago OP is using alt accounts to try and get people to buy his bags lol permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 2 points 9 hours ago What about 30 years from now when WW3 starts?

Geologists estimate that a mere 19 ounces of silver exist in the Earth\u2019s crust for every 1 ounce of gold.

Do you have a favorite seller, some quick tips and techniques? In return, I'll leave a useful perspective for those who don't understand what's happening. Silver is increasing in value above the stock market. When that happens, historically, it is my understanding that there is fear in the population and a general belief that bad times are coming - and those bad times tend to happen, historically. The reason the price is increasing so much is that once that threshold is crossed, where the silver is more valuable than the market, people talk more about it and it is generally understood that things have gone from speculation to general feeling in the population. Inviduals can be stupid, but sometimes in large numbers, they can make fairly smart/educated decisions - sometimes. So it snowballs, more people talk about it, more people take it seriously, more people buy silver, the price rises. Now... will you lose your shirt if you invest now? Possibly. In your lifetime, the silver may not return to the price you bought it. But, if that silver stays in the family or you live another 50 years, chances are good it'll return to this value. Or, you could see it going even higher and never return to this value because our currency is so devalued. permalink parent award report block reply ViagraFalls 10 points 8 hours ago The first thing you need to understand about metals is the buyer/seller dynamic exists. If you sell your used car to a dealership, they might give you $1000 for it. Then you might find that they sold it for $1500-2000. Of course, you could sell your car to a person instead and get $1500. When dealing with metal dealers they are in the position of seller and you are in the position of buyer. With metals, I think people are paranoid about getting scammed, so they don\u2019t like to buy from other people. Aside from this if you buy a substantial amount, you will probably want insurance on it, which is an additional cost and a scam. I heard they just automatically reject all claims. So if your $15,000 worth of metals disappears in shipping, you\u2019ll have to be starting a lawsuit. I would only recommend buying metals if you think a major currency crash (hyperinflation) will happen. The prophet that predicted Trump getting shot in the ear also said there will be a currency crash and USD will be replaced by the Amero for the US, Mexico, and Canada. If you have enough cash to buy 10 horses, but buy metals instead, when you sell your metals, you\u2019ll probably have enough cash to buy 9 horses in whatever you get at the time. If the currency gets highly devalued, all the cash you kept will be enough to buy a pack of toilet paper instead of a horse. Ultimately, I think of buying metals as a way to preserve the value of money instead of a way to make money. The paper trading problem might prove me wrong about that. People (most likely ones with long crooked noses) came up with this idea of selling pieces of paper that say you have x amount of silver (or whatever metal). They\u2019re most likely selling 10 times as much silver than they have in stock. People will probably figure this out when it\u2019s too late and then they\u2019re just left with paper. This also enables the rich to manipulate the metal markets and keep the prices artificially low. Silver was around $45-48 in the 1980s. Some believe silver in the $20-25 range was artificial. If this whole scam collapses, the values of metals might shoot up to their proper values without manipulation going on making owning metals profitable even in terms of buying value. There is also the possibility of some new technology increasing the demand for a metal, but I wouldn\u2019t count on that happening. permalink parent award report block reply Thedaythe_redditdied 4 points 2 hours ago Excellent explanation I would like to point out one thing that you probably underestimated the paper silver sellers don\u2019t just give out 10 times paper what they have physical ( your local back actually does this with the US dollar. Yes they loan out 10 times more cash then they have) right now the paper to physically is 358 to 1. Meaning for every ounce of silver they have in thier vaults. They have sold 358 silver certificates for that one ounce. But wait you ask. What if I turn in my certificate and request the physical ounce be sent to me? If you ask for a couple ounces they might send you some. But if you ask for a lot. They will just send you a check in US dollars for the value of the silver  you supposedly own. Because you don\u2019t actually own the silver. A small tribe owns the silver and then lies to you and says it\u2019s yours and they will just keep it safe for you. Anyone interested in shiny rocks. you need to physically hold and control them your self or what you have is worth less than fiat cash. Silver or gold certificates are the second biggest scam going. After the US dollar. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... rextexMG 7 points 6 hours ago I buy direct from APMEX.com.

And don't listen to those here telling you that you might buy silver for $50 and sell it for $40.  That's bullshit.

You pay the premium when you buy it; at the moment silver is at $54 and APMEX is selling 1oz silver eagles for $62. Advice: avoid giant bars - they will be harder to sell.  5oz and 10oz are fine, but make sure the bars are a reputable known brand.  The best is to buy 1oz coins or rounds, they are easy to peel off and sell when you want to.  Don't buy fancy stuff, get the coins minted for each country: American silver eagles, Canadian maple leaf coins, UK Britannias, Austrian philharmonics, etc...

More simply, buy and sell price is on margin... So, if silver is 50$ it might be you buy for 50$ and sell for 40$. Also agreed that buying metals is more about preserving wealth than something like stocks where there's an expectation of stock price increasing above and beyond inflation. If you bought gold at 25$ and sold it at 100$, you can reasonably expect that the general costs for stuff will have gone up roughly proportional. The issue about the manipulation of prices is also true, and one of those rare moments where one could reasonably expect a real profit relative to inflation. I've heard arguments that gold prices SHOULD be trading at about 2-3x the prices at the time and silver, because of the industrial uses should be in the range of 5-10x the market. This isn't something worth counting on because if that music does stop and people buying gold and silver for 1-20k per oz, then there's going to be a lot more going on to worry about, and are just as likely to be facing a barter scenario. permalink parent award report block reply Meow4me2 1 points 4 hours ago We are buying for a local dealer (check with BBB for complaints) and looking to set up a gold IRA now to lock in some gains from the stock market. Local dealer - markup will likely be 1-2% higher than an online company, but you can usually buy in smaller portions, so easier to add a bit here or there. I found our dealer via an online search, checked reviews and BBB, then met before deciding to buy from him. Online dealer - minimum buys are higher, markups lower. We haven\u2019t gone this route because of worries over shipping \u201closses\u201d. I\u2019d rather pick it up directly myself from a local dealer. Precious metals IRA - Looking to move some money from an IRA overweighted in stocks to metals. IRA is physical metals held in a depository for us.

Ultimately, I think of buying metals as a way to preserve the value of money instead of a way to make money. The paper trading problem might prove me wrong about that. People (most likely ones with long crooked noses) came up with this idea of selling pieces of paper that say you have x amount of silver (or whatever metal). They\u2019re most likely selling 10 times as much silver than they have in stock. People will probably figure this out when it\u2019s too late and then they\u2019re just left with paper. This also enables the rich to manipulate the metal markets and keep the prices artificially low. Silver was around $45-48 in the 1980s. Some believe silver in the $20-25 range was artificial. If this whole scam collapses, the values of metals might shoot up to their proper values without manipulation going on making owning metals profitable even in terms of buying value. There is also the possibility of some new technology increasing the demand for a metal, but I wouldn\u2019t count on that happening. permalink parent award report block reply Thedaythe_redditdied 4 points 2 hours ago Excellent explanation I would like to point out one thing that you probably underestimated the paper silver sellers don\u2019t just give out 10 times paper what they have physical ( your local back actually does this with the US dollar. Yes they loan out 10 times more cash then they have) right now the paper to physically is 358 to 1. Meaning for every ounce of silver they have in thier vaults. They have sold 358 silver certificates for that one ounce. But wait you ask. What if I turn in my certificate and request the physical ounce be sent to me? If you ask for a couple ounces they might send you some. But if you ask for a lot. They will just send you a check in US dollars for the value of the silver  you supposedly own. Because you don\u2019t actually own the silver. A small tribe owns the silver and then lies to you and says it\u2019s yours and they will just keep it safe for you. Anyone interested in shiny rocks. you need to physically hold and control them your self or what you have is worth less than fiat cash. Silver or gold certificates are the second biggest scam going.

Do you have a favorite seller, some quick tips and techniques? In return, I'll leave a useful perspective for those who don't understand what's happening. Silver is increasing in value above the stock market. When that happens, historically, it is my understanding that there is fear in the population and a general belief that bad times are coming - and those bad times tend to happen, historically. The reason the price is increasing so much is that once that threshold is crossed, where the silver is more valuable than the market, people talk more about it and it is generally understood that things have gone from speculation to general feeling in the population. Inviduals can be stupid, but sometimes in large numbers, they can make fairly smart/educated decisions - sometimes. So it snowballs, more people talk about it, more people take it seriously, more people buy silver, the price rises. Now... will you lose your shirt if you invest now? Possibly. In your lifetime, the silver may not return to the price you bought it. But, if that silver stays in the family or you live another 50 years, chances are good it'll return to this value. Or, you could see it going even higher and never return to this value because our currency is so devalued. permalink parent award report block reply ViagraFalls 10 points 8 hours ago The first thing you need to understand about metals is the buyer/seller dynamic exists. If you sell your used car to a dealership, they might give you $1000 for it. Then you might find that they sold it for $1500-2000. Of course, you could sell your car to a person instead and get $1500. When dealing with metal dealers they are in the position of seller and you are in the position of buyer. With metals, I think people are paranoid about getting scammed, so they don\u2019t like to buy from other people. Aside from this if you buy a substantial amount, you will probably want insurance on it, which is an additional cost and a scam. I heard they just automatically reject all claims. So if your $15,000 worth of metals disappears in shipping, you\u2019ll have to be starting a lawsuit. I would only recommend buying metals if you think a major currency crash (hyperinflation) will happen. The prophet that predicted Trump getting shot in the ear also said there will be a currency crash and USD will be replaced by the Amero for the US, Mexico, and Canada. If you have enough cash to buy 10 horses, but buy metals instead, when you sell your metals, you\u2019ll probably have enough cash to buy 9 horses in whatever you get at the time.

As soon as you need to cash in any amount you quickly learn industry collusion is a thing. NOBODY will give you anything near what it's worth. If you cash in to the big guys they assume you bought it from one of them and joo down your payout no matter who you bought it from, not to mention fees and taxes. So you go to the local shop and they know you're there because the big guys are screwing you or you're desperate for cash and screw you just as much. BUT BUT BUT muh society collapses...nobody is going to trade you their goods needed to survive for useless metal. And anyone who thinks hoarding metals is going to somehow stick it to the man, get over yourself...the man has successfully pysopped you into gleefully handing over your shekels. If cash is going to be so worthless and metals are the future, why the everloving fuck would they be so willing to take your soon-to-be-worthless money in exchange for the only thing of value in the future?
