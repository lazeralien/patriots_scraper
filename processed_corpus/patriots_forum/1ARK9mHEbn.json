Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine has a saying, \"Everything is securities fraud.\" which means that virtually any negative corporate behavior can lead to securities fraud claims if it affects shareholders. For instance, if a company fails to disclose harmful information that impacts its stock price, it may face lawsuits from shareholders claiming securities fraud. I imagine that hiring H1b's with fake degrees would qualify since the risk of a fuck up would be higher and any fuckups would entail more liability than if they had legit degrees since corporate should have known. What we need is a MAGA law firm to file nuisance securities fraud lawsuits against individual directors and CEOs, not because we expect to win damages, but to intimidate them into not hiring people with fake degrees. permalink award report block reply TrumpPl4yedU 1 points 8 hours ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply -Evspra 1 points 8 hours ago u/GuerillaYourDreams check out the username.
