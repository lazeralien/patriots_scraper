RIP to all the young men lost to us. posted 1 day ago by friarfox 7 comments award share report block In Flanders fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\nScarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie,\nIn Flanders fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe:\nTo you from failing hands we throw\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high.\nIf ye break faith with us who die\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\nIn Flanders fields.\n7 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save JohnN 4 points 1 day ago Good post.
