They really don't have much of a bite... The State of Chihuahua has more than a few narco death pits that have been exhumed, recovering bodies and shell casings.

(See dog mauling statistics) **Gun's can't escape your home and murder someone, but  pitbulls can.  (And have done in many circumstances) If you want a dog, get a golden retriever, lab, or other dog which is loving, but will still defend you.  (But not murder your neighbors) permalink parent award report block reply Reefay 8 points 4 days ago But, have you met my neighbors? permalink parent award report block reply mailinvoter 6 points 4 days ago Are they Chihuahuans? permalink parent award report block reply TRexScrotum 3 points 4 days ago S\u00ed permalink parent award report block reply SpellingContable 3 points 4 days ago I dont know. Chihuahuas are always on edge. Always just a 'hello puppy' away from snapping and losing their shit at you. Look at them with those bulging high BP eyes. Nasty bite too. Imagine if those little buggers were 2 or 3 foot tall. permalink parent award report block reply wolfsettler 1 points 4 days ago They're not real dogs.\nThey're fucking rats that people pretend are dogs because they're too pussy to get any real dog. permalink parent award report block reply IForgotToAddAnEmail 0 points 4 days ago Yea, sounds like you don't know how to raise a dog permalink parent award report block reply flopperdog 2 points 4 days ago Pitbulls were BRED to fight other dogs, dumbass. *Their instinct is to kill, and there are plenty of cases of well trained \"family pitbulls\" snapping and mauling people. **If you think \"good training\" can override their instinct to kill, then you're a fucking idiot.  (And a TERRIBLE parent if you \"trust\" your kids with a monster that could snap at any minute) permalink parent award report block reply wolfsettler -1 points 4 days ago You sound like a fucking moron permalink parent award report block reply BlackLabsMatter -1 points 4 days ago A few years ago, I would have agreed with you.  Sadly I watched a neighbor's pit go psycho on one of his friends.  She was such a gentle dog before that night, then for no reason she went wholly evil. The friend got tore up a bit but not life altering thankfully.  She 100% was socialized, obedience trained, and the family had a kid about 3 years old.  She was never harmed.  No one in her home was threatened that night. While you can train any dog, and any dog can be kind and gentle, you must always take into account what the dog is and what it was bred for.  That class of dog is absolutely not too be trusted.  Sadly. permalink parent award report block reply IForgotToAddAnEmail 1 points 3 days ago And I feel sorry for you. But if Chihuahuas were any bit bigger, they'd be the number 1 dog put down. Dog gave warning signs I bet. SEen videos of idiots let their child bounce on a dog as it continues to let growl warnings out. Only for it to snap because it doesn't want to be jumped on constantly and everyone freaks out on the dog. I don't believe it. Yes it happens, I've been bit by a black lab. Right on my lips. Friendly dog, not that day. Do I hate all dogs? Absolutely not. permalink parent award report block reply wolfsettler 1 points 4 days ago Comment removed by community filter. permalink parent award report block reply wolfsettler -1 points 4 days ago No one cares what you have to say faggot permalink parent award report block reply flopperdog 1 points 3 days ago If you could justify owning a Pitbull, you'd say why it's worth it... *But you can't, because you're a selfish piece of trash who risks other people's safety so you can have a \"cool pet\". permalink parent award report block reply djentropyhardcore -2 points 4 days ago If you're defending \"owning\" \"pets\", you're an idiot.
