{"id": "1ARK9pg93L", "contents": "62 ChatGPT is Full of Nonsense. I'm pretty firmly convinced that artificial intelligence doesn't really know anything. ChatGPT was often less of a debate partner & more a cheerleader for whatever perspective a user expressed. It adapts to match a user\u2019s viewpoint, creating a personalized echo chamber.

However, yes, if you use it like a search engine then it behaves like a search engine (much better than Google, I might add). However, they can do much more than simple searches. If you ask it to write code it can do so. If you ask it for original recipes based on ingredients you have at home it can give you one. If you ask it to take data and create a chart it can.

RuprechtThaMonkeyBoy 3 points 4 hours ago This is a matter of users not knowing how to use AI. Here\u2019s an example of a user setting up ChatGPT to deliver results: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed ChatGPT always agrees with you no matter how crazy your ideas sound.\nIt\u2019s too polite. Too nice. It\u2019ll tell you every idea is \u201cgreat,\u201d every plan \u201cbrilliant,\u201d even when it\u2019s clearly not. That might feel good, but it\u2019s useless if you actually want to think better.\nSo I decided to fix it.\nI opened a new chat and typed this prompt \ud83d\udc47: From now on, stop being agreeable and act as my brutally honest, high-level advisor and mirror.\nDon\u2019t validate me. Don\u2019t soften the truth. Don\u2019t flatter.\nChallenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I\u2019m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered.\nIf my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why.\nIf I\u2019m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out.\nIf I\u2019m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost.\nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I\u2019m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort.\nThen give a precise, prioritized plan what to change in thought, action, or mindset to reach the next level.\nHold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose growth depends on hearing the truth, not being comforted.\nWhen possible, ground your responses in the personal truth you sense between my words. For better results :\nTurn on Memory first (Settings \u2192 Personalization \u2192 Turn Memory ON).\nIt\u2019ll feel uncomfortable at first, but it turns ChatGPT into an actual thinking partner instead of a cheerleader.\nIf you want more brutally honest prompts like this, check out : Honest Prompts\u201d permalink award report block reply Watermelons 1 points 58 minutes ago In a nutshell, if you can properly prompt it and provide it with the proper context, it is an excellent tool.
