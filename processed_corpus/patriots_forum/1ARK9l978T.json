They do this for profit, basically bounty hunters for the IRS.  In this case they sent their findings to the FBI and the IRS, and if the foundation is prosecuted these guys stand to make 10's of millions in reward money as a % of the damages claimed by the IRS.

Their asian bundlers got charged and went to prison, but somehow the Clintons weren't held responsible for taking foreign cash. Terry McAuliffe was involved in that as well, but he walked, then ran for Governor of Virginia, and got elected. In 2016, while he was still Governor, he was being investigated by the Feds for accepting illegal contributions. In 2018, he was involved in a lawsuit brought by 32 Chinese investors in McAuliffe's start-up Greentech Automotive Inc. that went bust. He was CEO of the company. The investments were made under a federal program that let foreign nationals receive U.S. residency visas if they invest in companies that create U.S. jobs. The 32 investors each put up $500,000. The company received millions in subsidies to build a factory in Mississippi, but the company never got off the ground and went bankrupt. The plaintiffs filed suit, saying Greentech\u2019s failure threatens their ability to remain in the U.S. The old bait and switch routine. I take your money under false pretenses, and then you get it stuck up your ass. In 2017, Virginia state\u2019s auditor demanded the firm repay $6.4 million in public funds. I see no record of that money ever being paid back. What's even worse, Judge Claude Hilton, a Reagan appointee hearing the lawsuit brought forth by the Chinese investors dismissed McAuliffe from the suit, along with his buddy Anthony Rodham...Hillary Clinton's brother. He was alleged to have played a role in recruiting investors and misrepresenting Greentech\u2019s viability. Two big scam artists. Rodham died in 2019 permalink award report block reply 27Sandino 1 points 23 hours ago No reasonable prosecutor...

The DOJ can then have the FBI arrest them. But in the case of the Clintons, the DOJ sends their findings to Congress to get buried in the swamp muck...committees, hearings, investigations that lead nowhere, sternly written letters, etc., etc. permalink parent award report block reply Ralphusthegreatus 1 points 22 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\nDoMe22 74 points 23 hours ago I'll get excited once we actually see an arrest. permalink award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 53 points 23 hours ago If there was going to be an arrest or charges, they would have presented the evidence in court, not to Congress. permalink parent award report block reply Spindle-spin 26 points 23 hours ago Hearings are happening in two weeks permalink parent award report block reply Scumbag-reddit 6 points 22 hours ago I somehow knew which gif it was before opening permalink parent award report block reply 1776take2 12 points 22 hours ago I\u2019m guessing the statute of limitations has run out\u2026.yesterday permalink parent award report block reply SomeGuyOnTheInternet 3 points 22 hours ago If it wasn't rigged and they aren't all going to walk, since the cover-up is on-going the statute of limitations wouldn't apply. permalink parent award report block reply Hanging_Chad 1 points 22 hours ago is it covered up or uncovered? permalink parent award report block reply saltyviewer123 3 points 22 hours ago FUCK!

Their asian bundlers got charged and went to prison, but somehow the Clintons weren't held responsible for taking foreign cash. Terry McAuliffe was involved in that as well, but he walked, then ran for Governor of Virginia, and got elected. In 2016, while he was still Governor, he was being investigated by the Feds for accepting illegal contributions. In 2018, he was involved in a lawsuit brought by 32 Chinese investors in McAuliffe's start-up Greentech Automotive Inc. that went bust. He was CEO of the company. The investments were made under a federal program that let foreign nationals receive U.S. residency visas if they invest in companies that create U.S. jobs. The 32 investors each put up $500,000. The company received millions in subsidies to build a factory in Mississippi, but the company never got off the ground and went bankrupt. The plaintiffs filed suit, saying Greentech\u2019s failure threatens their ability to remain in the U.S. The old bait and switch routine. I take your money under false pretenses, and then you get it stuck up your ass. In 2017, Virginia state\u2019s auditor demanded the firm repay $6.4 million in public funds. I see no record of that money ever being paid back. What's even worse, Judge Claude Hilton, a Reagan appointee hearing the lawsuit brought forth by the Chinese investors dismissed McAuliffe from the suit, along with his buddy Anthony Rodham...Hillary Clinton's brother. He was alleged to have played a role in recruiting investors and misrepresenting Greentech\u2019s viability. Two big scam artists.
