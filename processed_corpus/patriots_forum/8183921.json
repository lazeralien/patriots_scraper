Wonder if he's that determined if someone is wearing a MAGA cap. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 1 points 15 hours ago The MAGA cap is his sign to remember their name so that guy\u2019s vote goes into the trash and is replaced by a prefilled ballot with the Dems filled out. permalink parent award report block reply QSWO1 1 points 14 hours ago Texas only requires another state ID to get a Texas DL.

Fuck the Republicans if they don't arrest people over this. I won't vote and I won't donate unless I start seeing more arrests. The left is literally trying to murder and replace us. Frankly I would rather see these people put in gulags through extrajudicial means than vote for moderation. Put the left in gulags. permalink award report block reply texas4ever 4 points 19 hours ago Sitting it out punishes conservatives though. permalink parent award report block reply MasterChief08 11 points 18 hours ago If Republicans can't even arrest leftists getting illegal immigrants to vote, wtf am I even supporting? Demographics and secure government are all that ultimately matter. Every other issue can be fixed if those 2 things are secure. Gun rights, abortion restrictions, strong economic output, low taxes - all of those things rely on demographic certainty and secure elections. permalink parent award report block reply texas4ever 1 points 14 hours ago What we have now for all the flaws is a million times better than the alternative, that's what. permalink parent award report block reply LiberalTearsMiner 11 points 19 hours ago Not when they steal the elections using registered voters who are illegal who don\u2019t know they\u2019re registered.

There are counties where >70% of the Kindergarten class speaks no English. permalink award report block reply gaijin_ronin 18 points 19 hours ago All the while my city council and mayor floated the idea recently to make us a sanctuary city.  These traitors deserve nothing less than execution. permalink award report block reply gaijin_ronin 5 points 19 hours ago Also our DMV is understaffed and backlogged.  Most of the DMV is filled with typical government worker trash and probably just push the paper work through like drones. permalink parent award report block reply Klown_Kutz 3 points 9 hours ago Funny how when it\u2019s you and me, these same drones make it their mission in life to deny us a license. permalink parent award report block reply gaijin_ronin 1 points 5 hours ago Yep, just like vote counting errors. permalink parent award report block reply tired-of-crap 2 points 8 hours ago In Florida for the most part we basically got rid of all the state employees that did driver's license functions and replaced them with tax collector employees which I don't know whether that is better or worse.  I do know the tax collector employees are supported only by a service fee added to the amount and not the general tax revenue though. permalink parent award report block reply gaijin_ronin 1 points 5 hours ago In NC years ago we had private contracted DMV offices in addition to state run locations.  The contract ended after claims customer service was awful and for \"cost savings for the state. \" Now there are only a couple offices open and appointments are months out for certain needs. We can renew our DL online but only so many times and for all other cases you need the office.   We really need more locations but that means more state employee leeches. permalink parent award report block reply ThorsonTT 15 points 19 hours ago This is what Motor Voter laws were designed to do.  Register everyone, so unscrupulous SoS' could pass that info off to whomever generates all those Democrat votes that appear out of fat air. permalink award report block reply Deplora 9 points 18 hours ago And designed to register them whether they want to be registered or not.  I had direct knowledge of this happening to a foreign student in Pennsylvania over 25 years ago.  She was perfectly fluent in English, went to get a driver's license, had no intention of registering or voting, and made a point of not checking the \"register to vote\" box on the paper form (this was back when it was still an opt-in process; now the person has to check a box on the computer form to opt out of the voter registration process).  She was shocked when she received her new voter registration card in the mail a short time later.  Also a bit scared, because she was afraid somebody would think she'd registered on purpose, and she knew it was illegal. permalink parent award report block reply LostElf 10 points 19 hours ago Hopefully this will make them easier to find and deport. permalink award report block reply PiratePatriot 6 points 19 hours ago in an age of mobile phones and cash becoming scarce - everyone is using cards to pay - tracking mobile phones and where cards are used makes finding people VERY easy and accurate. permalink parent award report block reply Taliesin 2 points 17 hours ago And make it easier to find the fake ballots being cast in their names. permalink parent award report block reply POTUS_DonnieJ 9 points 18 hours ago So every registration has at least one bureaucrat behind it. How about starting to arrest the ones that were directly responsible for signing off on those applications. In theory the feds can start going after those people personally for being negligent in their duties and issuing licenses in violation of federal law. And because they're negligent, they wouldn't be able to hide behind any state immunity or use the state taxpayer funded employee defense fund. Start making life hell for all of those traitors instead of releasing reports and asking for more investigations. permalink award report block reply tired-of-crap 2 points 8 hours ago I guarantee that nearly everyone of these systems have identifier to show who did the transactions. Once they determine that for 1 person go back and look at all their transactions. permalink parent award report block reply PhantomShield72 9 points 18 hours ago Excuse me, I was told this doesn't happen... permalink award report block reply I_Love_45-70_Gov 5 points 18 hours ago Motor Voter.

And illegals get driver's licenses... as an added bonus, when you're forced to sign up for Covered California health care or given coverage for free (illegals), you ALSO get signed up to vote. Both the DMV and the Covered California \"exchange\" are now extensions of the Secretary of State for voter registrations. permalink award report block reply Hikedelics 2 points 18 hours ago If this doesn\u2019t result in every person who ever had so much as a keystrokes involvement in a single illegal being registered going to prison, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019lll\u2026 I\u2019ll probably be pretty fucking pissed and still go about my day as I would have otherwise. What the fuck is going on with our country and why can\u2019t we fix it? HOW can we fix it at this point?

Mexican nationals are given licenses and ballots permalink award report block reply mass55th 1 points 16 hours ago That shouldn't surprise anyone.

Why you gotta be a bummer?\u2026 permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 1 points 17 hours ago You have to put serious effort into not being registered to vote these days. permalink award report block reply KungPaoMcChicken 1 points 17 hours ago You know my Viet ex, she came to Australia with a motorcycle license and she took it into the local office and was told that they would give her a full motorcycle license here. And I kept thinking, do they know that she literally drove mopeds? Like I imagine if she bought a full motorcycle, she would be wrecked trying to ride it. permalink award report block reply AZTrumpette1776 1 points 5 hours ago https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra permalink award report block reply MocksFordComma 1 points 16 hours ago Now do California.

Election fraud. permalink award report block reply tired-of-crap 1 points 8 hours ago Maybe the state should stop hiring Indian programmers. It is trivial to have logic like \"if not citizen do not present motor voter options\". Trivial to normal programmers, but not necessarily to the cheap Indian ones that don't actually even have the credentials they claim. permalink award report block reply CatalystForChange 1 points 18 hours ago They do it openly here in Commiefornia.

They asked me this a couple of years ago when I went to renew my NC license and I told them \"no thank you\" and they didn't mention it again and I certainly haven't gotten any voter junk in the mail. But then again, it's a small rural town where everyone knows each other and it's surrounded by hog farms. Everyone just handles their own business and no one calls law enforcement. Yankees are terrified to set foot anywhere in the entire county and that's a good thing. permalink award report block reply TerrorAndSlaughter 1 points 17 hours ago I bet they don't know that there will be a ballot mailed out, filled out, and turned in for them either. permalink award report block reply Goatboy66 1 points 16 hours ago Throw these POS in prison for Aiding And Abetting/Harboring Illegal Aliens....All Felonies. permalink award report block reply ClarenceBeeks 1 points 17 hours ago Here\u2019s the scam:  this illegal registration creates a ballot. This goes on a long list of ballots known to represent those who generally don\u2019t vote. Like dead people and people who moved away. Then at election time, all those ballots are harvested by activist criminals. That\u2019s how we lose our country despite being a majority. permalink award report block reply ClarenceBeeks 1 points 17 hours ago I\u2019m certain this is what they did in CA and they are replicating now everywhere they get political cover permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 1 points 18 hours ago Stealing votes is grand theft, murder and treason all at the same time and more. Your vote can do more damage in the wrong hands than a tranny with a gun in a school zone. It should be treated as the high crime it is and all those involved need to be shot permalink award report block reply RexCollumSilvarum 1 points 16 hours ago Friendly reminder that voting in elections has ZERO relation with being able to drive an automobile , and that in many US states it is easier to register to vote as an illegal alien who can drive than it is as a US citizen with a disability that prevents you from driving. That is not how voting rights are supposed to be handled. permalink award report block reply Lasheric 1 points 13 hours ago CA did this too, to anyone who signed up for covered California (their healthcare) fraud permalink award report block reply ColonelKlink 1 points 19 hours ago Arrest them and throw them in prison. permalink award report block reply\nBOHICA2021 45 points 19 hours ago remember when Barry set all this up on his way out...I do. permalink award report block reply Quixotic 25 points 19 hours ago motor voter (ACORN) happened waaaay before obongo permalink parent award report block reply God-is-good 1 points 4 hours ago I\u2019m sure they will have been voting without their knowledge too. permalink parent award report block reply\nQuixotic 25 points 19 hours ago motor voter (ACORN) happened waaaay before obongo permalink parent award report block reply God-is-good 1 points 4 hours ago I\u2019m sure they will have been voting without their knowledge too. permalink parent award report block reply\nGod-is-good 1 points 4 hours ago I\u2019m sure they will have been voting without their knowledge too. permalink parent award report block reply\nRocketSprocket 42 points 19 hours ago Time to crack down or lose our country. permalink award report block reply ImYourHuckleberry24 12 points 19 hours ago Too late permalink parent award report block reply MakeFloridaRed 30 points 19 hours ago Guarantee it\u2019s happening in every state too. permalink parent award report block reply zerk0021 12 points 18 hours ago Guarantee it's happening in California.

I had direct knowledge of this happening to a foreign student in Pennsylvania over 25 years ago.  She was perfectly fluent in English, went to get a driver's license, had no intention of registering or voting, and made a point of not checking the \"register to vote\" box on the paper form (this was back when it was still an opt-in process; now the person has to check a box on the computer form to opt out of the voter registration process).  She was shocked when she received her new voter registration card in the mail a short time later.  Also a bit scared, because she was afraid somebody would think she'd registered on purpose, and she knew it was illegal. permalink parent award report block reply\nDeplora 9 points 18 hours ago And designed to register them whether they want to be registered or not.

How about starting to arrest the ones that were directly responsible for signing off on those applications. In theory the feds can start going after those people personally for being negligent in their duties and issuing licenses in violation of federal law. And because they're negligent, they wouldn't be able to hide behind any state immunity or use the state taxpayer funded employee defense fund. Start making life hell for all of those traitors instead of releasing reports and asking for more investigations. permalink award report block reply tired-of-crap 2 points 8 hours ago I guarantee that nearly everyone of these systems have identifier to show who did the transactions.
