We're raised with morals and principles handed down to us from our parents and we use those lessons to determine our social and political belief systems.  The Left is ass-backward, they either reject those lessons or never learn them, then they enter college and/or adulthood not really having an identity, so they gravitate to what makes them feel good, what makes them feel like they belong, and at those ages and those settings that's going to be liberal ideology, the plan based almost entirely on emotional premises and denouncing facts and reality.  Their social and political ideology forms their identity, and as such and by definition, a person like that cannot have a discussion with those who believe differently, even slightly, because that would be the same as agreeing with the other \"side\".  The best they can do is pretend to act civilly while on the inside they wish you didn't exist.
