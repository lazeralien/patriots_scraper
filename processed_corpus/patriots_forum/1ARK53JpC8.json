Elon Musk doesn't have hundreds of billions of dollars just sitting in a bank somewhere. The reason he's worth all of that money is because he owns several businesses and his share of those companies amount to his net worth. So this idea that Elon Musk could just toss his money to people and solve world hunger is pure fantasy. permalink award report block reply Goozmania 2 points 6 days ago I know my position is not republican, but it shouldn't be feasible to become a trillionaire.

Rigged.  Definitely rigged.  To fix it, let's start by doing some very simple things: Kick every last person who is not a citizen or of this country. Then, find and remove those who obtained citizenship fraudulently. End foreign work visas.  Completely. End other foreign visas that are not very short term tourism or business trip, ensure the validity of those visas 100% End immigration entirely.  We are full.  They are nearly universally a drag on everything. No government subsidies out bailouts.  To anyone.  For anything. End welfare.  It is not the job of government to act as a parent or babysitter.  Family, friends and community need to step up.  No free food, nofree housing, no free phones. End all foreign aid. Pass a budget funding only that portion of government thatis clearly delineated in the Constitution--as written in the context of when it was written.  No redefining words. Reign intyrannical activist judges. Replace them with literate citizens.  Words mean things and are clearly defined. Revoke all laws containing words that are not clearly defined.  This removes any and all ambiguity from law. End income tax.  That amendment was never legally ratified.  (Did that one up if you want to be really mad) End ambiguous regulatory tyranny.  End all rules and regulations not initiated and passed by congress, or at aside constitutionally to the executive branch. Any surplus federal governnemnt money must be distributed in equal amounts to all the citizens at the end of the year. Zero base budgets.  No automatic bloat. Representatives to be paid a small per diem, not a salary. Lock up or execute violent criminals.  Predatory behavior is inexcusable andneeds to bit be a burden on decent people. Let's start there.  That seems like a lot less rigged to me, and a system that won't crash because of sedition or treasonous actions by government representatives or officials. Mr. Sanders, the government--and people like you in it--are the problem. permalink award report block reply Psalm-118_24 1 points 5 days ago bernie sanders has done nothing his entire life but steal from the American taxpayer.
