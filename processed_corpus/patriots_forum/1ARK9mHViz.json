How is that AF? Saying we need more H1B's? How is that AF? 50 year mortages and 15 year car loans? Spending the entire first year of his presidency making peace deals with 3rd world shitholes, while nobel, doesn't really help Americans. They are trying to get him to course correct before it's too late. permalink award report block reply AnonymousFrog 59 points 9 hours ago Some people are trying to turn MAGA into a cult of personality. permalink parent award report block reply Cali_kid 8 points 8 hours ago We need more voters MAGA is not enough to win elections. Trump is trying to pander to Boomers. We needed to vote this last election and we sat at home complaining about Football. permalink parent award report block reply TGNX 20 points 8 hours ago People did vote.

He had the backing of AOC and huge swaths of the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Harlem elected leaders. Mamdani was endorsed by Brad Lander the highest elected Jewish official. Cuomo had scandals involving female employees hanging over him and resignation from the governor's seat. He screwed up NY state's covid response and is accused of leading to death of many elderly. Mamdani won fair and square and in part to insane accusations.

Every president since Reagan sent our manufacturing jobs and tech jobs overseas. He is 100% right on how fucked we are on that front.

Chinese can\u2019t innovate, Joggers gonna jog folks are fucking dumb.  Same with the Jews must\u2019ve stole it crowd. Too much of MAGA has a giant blind spot around geniuses.  I mean the rare and real thing. Proper geniuses.  They think you can make them with elbow grease and a spanner wrench. Well. You can\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t understand that, you don\u2019t understand how the real world works. There\u2019s what, 4-5,000 proper geniuses (170IQ+) per generation? Out of 30 billion births. These people are who change the world. You have them or you fall WAY behind.  Ever wonder what leverage Israel really has?  They have an unusually high number of these people.  Which means they have innovations we need.  (Think really REALLY advanced weaponry).

Those of us who lived through the influx of DeSantis Alligator Emojis in 2023, or the Ted Cruz dead-enders in '16, with their paid-off influencers, upvote bots and constant consensus cracking and forum sliding, know what's going on. Also, a lot of these influencers and posters stirring up trouble right now (not all, but most) had alligator emojis in their Twitter profiles a couple of years ago. Laura Ingraham and Levin most prominently. permalink award report block reply RuprechtThaMonkeyBoy 14 points 9 hours ago Yes. permalink parent award report block reply hellohellohellohell 12 points 9 hours ago Also, here's a bit of context for the Laura Ingraham situation: https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2025/11/10/president-trump-appears-for-extensive-interview-with-laura-ingraham/ She's had Ron DeSantis on more than anyone else over the past year or so trying to rehab his reputation. She's definitely not MAGA, at least not entirely. permalink parent award report block reply JBlaze056 3 points 3 hours ago No Zionist is an America first person.  Zionism and America first are always against each other just as it was during the first iteration of America First under Charles Lindbergh in the 1930s.  How did they stop that movement?  They labeled him an \"antisemite\".  It is the exact same playbook being used by Shapiro, Levin and Loomer today.  They take our collective American conservative desires an repurposes them toward the Zionist wish list instead.  My hope is that it is not successful this time and instead they are purged from the party. permalink parent award report block reply cordsandfords 0 points 7 hours ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink parent award report block reply hellohellohellohell 10 points 8 hours ago Another of Laura's greatest hits: https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2020/01/15/laura-ingraham-blocks-devin-nunes-from-discussing-mary-mccord-working-with-adam-schiff/ Laura Ingraham Blocks Devin Nunes from Discussing Mary McCord Working With Adam Schiff\u2026 Do Laura Ingraham and Mary McCord have a history together in/around Washington DC schools, law firms, clerks, social circles etc? Because obviously Ingraham doesn\u2019t want Devin Nunes to discuss the revelations about former DOJ-NSD head Mary McCord now working with Adam Schiff on the impeachment agenda.  WATCH [@03:30] . Then again, it could be her typical Hannitus Interruptus style of self-important talking that destroys the opportunity for decent information. :::Sigh::: permalink parent award report block reply hellohellohellohell 9 points 9 hours ago Oh, here's a doozy: https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2023/07/22/ingraham-begs-president-trump-to-stop-crushing-field-and-give-desantis-a-chance/ from 2023: \"Ingraham Begs President Trump to Stop Crushing Field and Give DeSantis a Chance\" *Before getting to the insufferable video, it\u2019s worth remembering that Mrs. Hannity attended the late February donor retreat with \u201cbook tour\u201d Ron DeSantis. According to Jacksonville 4 News Governor Ron DeSantis \u201chuddled behind closed doors at a south Florida luxury hotel for a \u201cFreedom Blueprint\u201d retreat with more than 100 donors, elected officials and conservative influencers.\u201d  According to the report from those present, \u201cLaura Ingraham hosted a fireside chat with DeSantis on Sunday.\u201d * Also, it does not escape my recent memory how Mrs. Hannity refused to permit Devin Nunes to discuss deep state Mary McCord and her involvement in the weaponization of the DOJ against President Trump. Mrs. Hannity would not let Mr. Nunes talk about Mrs. McCord [REMINDER]. So, with that in mind, and knowing the fake news advocacy of the insufferable pundit, this advice from Mrs. Hannity to do exactly the wrong thing seems to have a rather desperate Rupert Murdoch stench to it. {Direct Rumble Link} WATCH: And another one: Laura Ingraham Interviews Presidential Candidate After Spending Weekend Retreat With Him, and Never Mentions It\u2026 *According to Jacksonville 4 News Governor Ron DeSantis spent last weekend \u201chuddled behind closed doors at a south Florida luxury hotel for a \u201cFreedom Blueprint\u201d retreat with more than 100 donors, elected officials and conservative influencers.\u201d  According to the report from those present, \u201cLaura Ingraham hosted a fireside chat with DeSantis on Sunday.\u201d * You would think this ongoing network and relationship would need a mention, perhaps even a disclaimer, if the Fox News pundit was going to follow up with additional promotion of the same candidate.  Alas, as more people become familiar with the tactics of the professionally Republican, what ends up being highlighted is the transparent effort to manipulate the viewer.  WATCH: https://youtu.be/lsFqpBZ3Y94 Factually, I\u2019m tired of the lies and manipulations.  It is difficult not to loathe these creatures now. Ms Ingraham continues her hypocritical false front as a conservative. {GO DEEP} This weekend the multinational lobbying group Club for Growth, headed by David McIntosh, are assembling a strategy session with big Wall Street donors to organize the multi-candidate roadmap for Ron DeSantis. permalink parent award report block reply hellohellohellohell 6 points 9 hours ago Ingraham has a very long history of this: https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2024/07/29/president-trump-interview-with-laura-ingraham-3/ President Donald Trump sat down for an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham to discuss current political events. Ingraham can quickly slip into the mode of telling Donald Trump what the current political events are; however, Mrs Hannity did pause her interruptions long enough to allow President Trump to articulate his side of her arguments.

They've all been sounding alarms. The other side is Shapiro, Levin and your establishment conservatives. permalink award report block reply hellohellohellohell 6 points 9 hours ago It's not that cut-and-dry. Fuck Levin and Shapiro, but the DeSantis and Cruz teams are salivating at the prospect of the MAGA coalition falling apart, and Vance/Rubio being wounded for '28. A lot of these influencers and posters stirring up trouble right now (not all, but most) had alligator emojis in their Twitter profiles a couple of years ago. Laura Ingraham and Levin, most prominently. Many of these anti-Tucker voices are now openly shilling for DeSantis over Vance in '28, because Vance hasn't shown adequate fealty to Israel and will clearly continue MAGA policies on tariffs and immigration. This is obviously a planned op. Neither Cruz nor DeSantis will do jack shit on H1Bs, deportations or expelling Chinese students, and they will shill 100X more for Israel, but they will lie through their teeth in the meantime to exploit MAGA fractures to gain leverage for '28. permalink parent award report block reply grad16uc 22 points 9 hours ago I don't care about the 28 ticket at all and I'd never vote for anyone you mentioned anyway. That's just politics. The coalition falls apart naturally though if you're consistently making mistakes. In just the last 24hrs, Trump sent a pardon letter on Bibi's behalf to Israel. He also strongly defended the H1Bs to Ingraham. So the things you're scared of happening are literally happening now. That's why people are mad. permalink parent award report block reply Mamapedia 11 points 8 hours ago Yes, no one here who doesn't like the flips is being manipulated by anyone in the media - they are reacting to what Trump has said and done.

They voted for Trump because they wanted him to \"fix\" things. Now, they're voting for people like Mamdani because he says \"free stuff!\". I Agree with you, Rich Baris and Mark Mitchell do have great insights, they ARE sounding the alarm saying \"There is a good chance we lose the midterms and they impeach Trump if something isn't done.\" What to do about it, I'm not sure, it's hard to argue about \"free stuff\" when people actually believe that shit. permalink parent award report block reply MissileToad 5 points 8 hours ago I have liked Rich Barris' work...

America first.  Zionists need to stop repurposing our America first agenda once again or they will be removed from the party.  The people most loudly trying to split the party right now are Levin, Shapiro, Loomer and their ilk who are calling for the denouncement and ban of people like Tucker, Candace and soon to be Vance.  They are creating the very wedge you are pointing out.  To deny that would be denying reality. permalink parent award report block reply America1stAndOnly 2 points 3 hours ago I'm really not sure what he thought he'd prove with that comment. permalink parent award report block reply America1stAndOnly 1 points 3 hours ago Christ is king.

Also, a lot of these influencers and posters stirring up trouble right now (not all, but most) had alligator emojis in their Twitter profiles a couple of years ago.
