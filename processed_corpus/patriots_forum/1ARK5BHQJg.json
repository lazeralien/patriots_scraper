With Americans being laid off by Big Tech, there should be zero H1-B visas. johnny maga @_johnnymaga \u2022 3d Woah. Trump\u2019s Secretary of Labor just announced that they have over 175 investigations into companies suspected of abusing the H-1B visa program. She says they\u2019re going to force employers to post job openings to the American public before hiring H-1Bs.\n19 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Around the Web Awakened 18 points 3 days ago Trump, you need to end this shit. Then again, I forgot big tech bought you during the election. permalink award report block reply CanadianLad 11 points 3 days ago Canadian software engineer here who's end game is to work for a US software company, even I recognize that this would require an H1B, and, well, yall gotta have a go at those jobs first before foreigners. That's literally what America First means. permalink award report block reply Lamal 1 points 2 days ago I think if we eliminated the fraud from India and China there would be a lot less anger and resentment and you'd have a much better chance. And I appreciate that you get it -- USA is finally attempting to defend its birthright. I hope Canada somehow finds a way to do so also. permalink parent award report block reply CanadianLad 2 points 2 days ago Thanks man, totally appreciated. Canada's a lost cause. We're being overrun still by our current communist liberal regime. I still believe in the American Dream. Currently, my main way of getting into America is to open a software firm there, and create US jobs. There's a special category for technology, but it's viable, and creates America-first jobs. I live in Taiwan now, but yeah, eventually I gotta come back to North America.

There should also be some delays, like say, a 6 month period where companies have to post advertisements for the position and demonstrate how many applicants showed up before they can apply for some foreigners for that specific role only. permalink award report block reply ChilledCovfefe 5 points 3 days ago Cut them off!! American tech people are being laid off by tens of thousands and it\u2019s impossible to find a full time role.  I know many in this situation. permalink award report block reply The_RedWolf 4 points 3 days ago Layoffs should come from H-1Bs first.  If youre laying off 100 people from a department, any H1Bs in that department need to be the first cut. permalink award report block reply BruddahIz 4 points 3 days ago Write your own sternly worded letter in two weeks in the job posting - we will  then let you hire all the H1B's you want. - Trump Admin. permalink award report block reply jermzdeejd 3 points 2 days ago When you fine a multi billion dollar company a few grand at a time it really doesn't have much of an effect. permalink award report block reply FromBilgewater 3 points 2 days ago Gotta get rid of the foreigners in managerial positions. Once they get in a position to hire, they ONLY hire their own.

No, you must fire an H1B visa worker and move the US worker. Hell, most large business have already implemented internal talent market platforms (ITMs) that can easily execute the process. (Google \"Gartner Internal Talent Markets platforms\") This definitely needs to be a thing! Who's telling Trump? permalink award report block reply WildStar 2 points 2 days ago They already post the jobs. That's why they all require ten years of experience for an entry level position. permalink award report block reply NoticesBugleOWO 1 points 3 days ago If someone is so critical to a company's ability to function, then that company should be sponsoring that person for a green card and the person should be pledging allegiance to the US and give up their other citizenship once they meet the requirements for US citizenship.
