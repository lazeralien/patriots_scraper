The courts do not have authority over anyone in the executive. They can make decisions as to the legality of executive action. Were the executive in egregious enough violation then Congress could take action to impeach executive office holders. But, the courts themselves have no authority to compel executive officers to take any particular action. They can issue an opinion stating that they should, or should not, to be in compliance with the law. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 2 points 2 days ago The courts LITERALLY have ultimate authority over the legality of Trump's actions.

RedStoneDeepState brilliantly quoted Article III of our US Constitution, which is a reliable source.  You could build on that though and discuss judicial review as it was argued in 1803 with Marbury vs Madison which ruled that the judicial branch has the ability to review LAWS put forth by the legislative branch as unconstitutional.  It was very specifically a check that the judicial branch ruled they had the power to do, but it was limited to the legislative branch.  Now, over the years, it's been abused and most recently has been weaponized against Trump. Next, the only court that we are compelled to have is the Supreme Court.  Did you know every other court has been created out of an act of congress?  That's right, these lower courts are all created by congress (and can be taken away by congress). So, while a court can rule that an executive action is unconstitutional, they cannot create new powers and confer them to the president, nor can they deny the president the powers he already has, nor can they relegate new powers that were normally congressional (such as the power of the purse given to the House) to another branch. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 -1 points 2 days ago You're trying to sound smart with Marbury v. Madison but you completely misread the case. The case was literally Marbury v. Madison. James Madison was the Secretary of State, part of the Executive Branch. The entire dispute was about whether the court could force an executive officer to do his job. While the ruling did strike down a legislative act, it simultaneously established the principle that the judiciary can review the actions of both the legislative and executive branches. The idea that judicial review doesn't apply to the President is a historical fantasy. Youngstown v. Sawyer (where the court stopped Truman from seizing steel mills) and United States v. Nixon (where the court forced Nixon to turn over the tapes) are cornerstone cases that prove the judiciary has always had the power to check the executive. Who cares if Congress created the lower courts? They exist now, and their rulings are binding federal law. The executive must follow them unless the Supreme Court says otherwise. Your entire argument is based on a fourth-grade misreading of the most famous court case in U.S. history. permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 2 points 2 days ago You know, I come at you with good faith and your first and last comment is a personal attack against me \"trying to sound smart\" and a \"fourth-grade misreading.\"  Come on, I didn't personally attack you.  I was one of the few people trying to strike up a conversation.  Sheesh.  Now you just look like a retarded troll... and I was trying to give you a chance. I blame myself for ignoring the community heavily downvoting you.  But, we all have a lapse in judgement at times. I will still respond, not for you, but for the others on here who want better context than your oversimplification. And while some of the stuff you say is true, it's lacking substantial context and history.  You do an OK job coming up with examples of how the powers were expanded 150 years after the ruling (which honestly only help what I was saying).  You need to look deeper in to issues and stop being so narrow focused.  I know it's hard to dig in to history, there is a lot of reading. For me, the source is the case itself and the actual majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Marshal, who's main focus was directed at Congress exceeding constitutional limits.  Marshal even wrote that the court couln't compel certain discretional executive acts, specifically showing a distinction between judicial review and some acts of the executive (specifically, discretionary acts, not ministerial duties). Here is what the actual case was: Congress does not have the power to pass laws that override the Constitution, such as by expanding the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. It seems pretty clear what was being argued. What you have shown that over time, this judicial review has expanded more frequently to the executive branch which, in my opinion, goes against what the majority opinion was in 1803. Here are some key parts of the transcript because I highly doubt you'll take the time to read it, after all, it is a couple pages long and the summary just isn't informative enough.  Take note of explicit, clear, and direct language.  He references the legislature and the law over and over again. The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the executive, merely to execute the will of the President, or rather to act in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear, that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . . It is, then, the opinion of the Court [that Marbury has a] right to the commission; a refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of that right, for which the laws of his country afford him a remedy. Furthermore: If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration. Furthermore: So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. ....  If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. Lastly: From these, and many other selections which might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature. Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it? When you read the opinion, it very briefly discusses executive actions.  But you are explaining how judicial review was later interpreted and expanded and not what Marshall explicitly ruled in 1803.

The fact is, you can't force the Executive branch to fund something that congress has not voted to fund. It's as simple as that. Food stamps are no different than any other government program. Just because a program is administered under a specific agency, doesn't mean any money that agency has can go to anything that agency oversees. Congress passed food stamps as a program a long time ago. It's on them to fund it. If they don't vote to fund it, then the program effectively ceases to exist, at least for the time being. permalink award report block reply Beat_to_Quarters 6 points 2 days ago Sounds like liberals and the appeals court want Trump to act like a king lol.

If an appeals court says you must fund it, then Trump must fund it. He can appeal to the Supreme Court and they\u2019ll make their decision, and if they say Trump must fund it, then he MUST FUND IT. permalink parent award report block reply preferredfault 11 points 2 days ago That's not true though. Our system of government doesn't work like that. Congress has the purse strings. Funds made available for a specific program, can only be legally used for that program. To force the Executive branch to fund anything is a violation of the separation of powers, because it forces the Executive to take on the role of congress by bypassing congress. Funny how there was a no kings protest, and then suddenly courts are ordering Trump to act like a king. If Trump can use disaster relief funds to pay for food stamps, then he can also use food stamp funds to build the wall, or for anything else he'd like. It'd be a terrible precedent that effectively nullifies congress in practice, for all of time. Why do we even need congress if courts can order Trump to pull money out of thin air? Why do we even need courts if Trump can pull money out of thin air?

The specifics of the ruling don't say that he's compelled to pay for SNAP, but that he's compelled to NOT WITHHOLD SNAP during the shutdown. You don't get to argue with this, because it's not a matter of opinion. The only step now is the Supreme Court. If they rule against him, then that's it. He MUST pay. permalink parent award report block reply preferredfault 1 points 2 days ago Trump isn't withholding SNAP, there's no funds appropriated for it. You can't withhold $0. They can't order him to pay funds that aren't there. I mean they can, but they can't enforce it. It's on congress to fund it. Congress not funding something is as good as defunding something, and such things have happened plenty of times. Let's say for example congress doesn't fund the FBI.....does Trump have to keep the FBI open? No. Does he have to take funds from some other program to fund it? No. Not unless congress votes to say he does. This is nothing more than political games; congress trying to use the courts to force Trump to do the duty that congress is tasked with. It would be a violation of separation of powers for Trump to comply, and the courts are violating separation of powers by trying to force Trump to comply, and congress is violating the separation of powers by trying to use the courts to force Trump to comply. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

The question before the court was can the executive withhold funds appropriated by Congress for a program, the answer is no. However, the question should be can the executive appropriate funds without congressional approval which is no . In order to \"comply\" with this ruling the Trump administration would have to violate the Constitution and appropriate funds without congressional approval, which they cannot do. The court knows they cannot do this, and, since theyre left wing activists at heart, are banking on people misunderstanding the entire proceeding and getting mad at Trump for ViOlAtInG a CoUrT OrDeR and DeStRoYiNg ChEcKs aNd BaLaNcEs because they, like you, have a very surface level understanding of how this all works. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

RedStoneDeepState brilliantly quoted Article III of our US Constitution, which is a reliable source.  You could build on that though and discuss judicial review as it was argued in 1803 with Marbury vs Madison which ruled that the judicial branch has the ability to review LAWS put forth by the legislative branch as unconstitutional.  It was very specifically a check that the judicial branch ruled they had the power to do, but it was limited to the legislative branch.  Now, over the years, it's been abused and most recently has been weaponized against Trump. Next, the only court that we are compelled to have is the Supreme Court.  Did you know every other court has been created out of an act of congress?  That's right, these lower courts are all created by congress (and can be taken away by congress). So, while a court can rule that an executive action is unconstitutional, they cannot create new powers and confer them to the president, nor can they deny the president the powers he already has, nor can they relegate new powers that were normally congressional (such as the power of the purse given to the House) to another branch. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 -1 points 2 days ago You're trying to sound smart with Marbury v. Madison but you completely misread the case. The case was literally Marbury v. Madison. James Madison was the Secretary of State, part of the Executive Branch. The entire dispute was about whether the court could force an executive officer to do his job. While the ruling did strike down a legislative act, it simultaneously established the principle that the judiciary can review the actions of both the legislative and executive branches. The idea that judicial review doesn't apply to the President is a historical fantasy. Youngstown v. Sawyer (where the court stopped Truman from seizing steel mills) and United States v. Nixon (where the court forced Nixon to turn over the tapes) are cornerstone cases that prove the judiciary has always had the power to check the executive. Who cares if Congress created the lower courts? They exist now, and their rulings are binding federal law. The executive must follow them unless the Supreme Court says otherwise. Your entire argument is based on a fourth-grade misreading of the most famous court case in U.S. history. permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 2 points 2 days ago You know, I come at you with good faith and your first and last comment is a personal attack against me \"trying to sound smart\" and a \"fourth-grade misreading.\"  Come on, I didn't personally attack you.  I was one of the few people trying to strike up a conversation.  Sheesh.  Now you just look like a retarded troll... and I was trying to give you a chance. I blame myself for ignoring the community heavily downvoting you.  But, we all have a lapse in judgement at times. I will still respond, not for you, but for the others on here who want better context than your oversimplification. And while some of the stuff you say is true, it's lacking substantial context and history.  You do an OK job coming up with examples of how the powers were expanded 150 years after the ruling (which honestly only help what I was saying).  You need to look deeper in to issues and stop being so narrow focused.  I know it's hard to dig in to history, there is a lot of reading. For me, the source is the case itself and the actual majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Marshal, who's main focus was directed at Congress exceeding constitutional limits.  Marshal even wrote that the court couln't compel certain discretional executive acts, specifically showing a distinction between judicial review and some acts of the executive (specifically, discretionary acts, not ministerial duties). Here is what the actual case was: Congress does not have the power to pass laws that override the Constitution, such as by expanding the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. It seems pretty clear what was being argued. What you have shown that over time, this judicial review has expanded more frequently to the executive branch which, in my opinion, goes against what the majority opinion was in 1803. Here are some key parts of the transcript because I highly doubt you'll take the time to read it, after all, it is a couple pages long and the summary just isn't informative enough.  Take note of explicit, clear, and direct language.  He references the legislature and the law over and over again. The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the executive, merely to execute the will of the President, or rather to act in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear, that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . . It is, then, the opinion of the Court [that Marbury has a] right to the commission; a refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of that right, for which the laws of his country afford him a remedy. Furthermore: If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration. Furthermore: So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. ....  If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. Lastly: From these, and many other selections which might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature. Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it? When you read the opinion, it very briefly discusses executive actions.  But you are explaining how judicial review was later interpreted and expanded and not what Marshall explicitly ruled in 1803.

RedStoneDeepState brilliantly quoted Article III of our US Constitution, which is a reliable source.  You could build on that though and discuss judicial review as it was argued in 1803 with Marbury vs Madison which ruled that the judicial branch has the ability to review LAWS put forth by the legislative branch as unconstitutional.  It was very specifically a check that the judicial branch ruled they had the power to do, but it was limited to the legislative branch.  Now, over the years, it's been abused and most recently has been weaponized against Trump. Next, the only court that we are compelled to have is the Supreme Court.  Did you know every other court has been created out of an act of congress?  That's right, these lower courts are all created by congress (and can be taken away by congress). So, while a court can rule that an executive action is unconstitutional, they cannot create new powers and confer them to the president, nor can they deny the president the powers he already has, nor can they relegate new powers that were normally congressional (such as the power of the purse given to the House) to another branch. permalink parent award report block reply Executarian2 -1 points 2 days ago You're trying to sound smart with Marbury v. Madison but you completely misread the case. The case was literally Marbury v. Madison. James Madison was the Secretary of State, part of the Executive Branch. The entire dispute was about whether the court could force an executive officer to do his job. While the ruling did strike down a legislative act, it simultaneously established the principle that the judiciary can review the actions of both the legislative and executive branches. The idea that judicial review doesn't apply to the President is a historical fantasy. Youngstown v. Sawyer (where the court stopped Truman from seizing steel mills) and United States v. Nixon (where the court forced Nixon to turn over the tapes) are cornerstone cases that prove the judiciary has always had the power to check the executive. Who cares if Congress created the lower courts? They exist now, and their rulings are binding federal law. The executive must follow them unless the Supreme Court says otherwise. Your entire argument is based on a fourth-grade misreading of the most famous court case in U.S. history. permalink parent award report block reply Trump-16-20-24-28-32 2 points 2 days ago You know, I come at you with good faith and your first and last comment is a personal attack against me \"trying to sound smart\" and a \"fourth-grade misreading.\"  Come on, I didn't personally attack you.  I was one of the few people trying to strike up a conversation.  Sheesh.  Now you just look like a retarded troll... and I was trying to give you a chance. I blame myself for ignoring the community heavily downvoting you.  But, we all have a lapse in judgement at times. I will still respond, not for you, but for the others on here who want better context than your oversimplification. And while some of the stuff you say is true, it's lacking substantial context and history.  You do an OK job coming up with examples of how the powers were expanded 150 years after the ruling (which honestly only help what I was saying).  You need to look deeper in to issues and stop being so narrow focused.  I know it's hard to dig in to history, there is a lot of reading. For me, the source is the case itself and the actual majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Marshal, who's main focus was directed at Congress exceeding constitutional limits.  Marshal even wrote that the court couln't compel certain discretional executive acts, specifically showing a distinction between judicial review and some acts of the executive (specifically, discretionary acts, not ministerial duties). Here is what the actual case was: Congress does not have the power to pass laws that override the Constitution, such as by expanding the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. It seems pretty clear what was being argued. What you have shown that over time, this judicial review has expanded more frequently to the executive branch which, in my opinion, goes against what the majority opinion was in 1803. Here are some key parts of the transcript because I highly doubt you'll take the time to read it, after all, it is a couple pages long and the summary just isn't informative enough.  Take note of explicit, clear, and direct language.  He references the legislature and the law over and over again. The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the executive, merely to execute the will of the President, or rather to act in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear, that the individual who considers himself injured, has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. . . . It is, then, the opinion of the Court [that Marbury has a] right to the commission; a refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of that right, for which the laws of his country afford him a remedy. Furthermore: If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration. Furthermore: So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. ....  If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. Lastly: From these, and many other selections which might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature. Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it? When you read the opinion, it very briefly discusses executive actions.  But you are explaining how judicial review was later interpreted and expanded and not what Marshall explicitly ruled in 1803.

The courts do not have authority over anyone in the executive. They can make decisions as to the legality of executive action.

The fact is, you can't force the Executive branch to fund something that congress has not voted to fund. It's as simple as that. Food stamps are no different than any other government program. Just because a program is administered under a specific agency, doesn't mean any money that agency has can go to anything that agency oversees. Congress passed food stamps as a program a long time ago. It's on them to fund it. If they don't vote to fund it, then the program effectively ceases to exist, at least for the time being. permalink award report block reply Beat_to_Quarters 6 points 2 days ago Sounds like liberals and the appeals court want Trump to act like a king lol.

If an appeals court says you must fund it, then Trump must fund it. He can appeal to the Supreme Court and they\u2019ll make their decision, and if they say Trump must fund it, then he MUST FUND IT. permalink parent award report block reply preferredfault 11 points 2 days ago That's not true though. Our system of government doesn't work like that. Congress has the purse strings. Funds made available for a specific program, can only be legally used for that program. To force the Executive branch to fund anything is a violation of the separation of powers, because it forces the Executive to take on the role of congress by bypassing congress. Funny how there was a no kings protest, and then suddenly courts are ordering Trump to act like a king. If Trump can use disaster relief funds to pay for food stamps, then he can also use food stamp funds to build the wall, or for anything else he'd like. It'd be a terrible precedent that effectively nullifies congress in practice, for all of time. Why do we even need congress if courts can order Trump to pull money out of thin air?

They can't order him to pay funds that aren't there. I mean they can, but they can't enforce it. It's on congress to fund it. Congress not funding something is as good as defunding something, and such things have happened plenty of times. Let's say for example congress doesn't fund the FBI.....does Trump have to keep the FBI open? No. Does he have to take funds from some other program to fund it? No. Not unless congress votes to say he does. This is nothing more than political games; congress trying to use the courts to force Trump to do the duty that congress is tasked with. It would be a violation of separation of powers for Trump to comply, and the courts are violating separation of powers by trying to force Trump to comply, and congress is violating the separation of powers by trying to use the courts to force Trump to comply. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...
