I grew up in the 80s and have a kid in high school now. I assure you the difference between bullying then and \"bullying\" now is pretty stark. Bullying in the 80s was mostly physical. In very rare circumstances, the violence was severe - but most of the time it was minor. Nowadays it's all \"virtual\" bullying and it never stops. I'd argue it is worse. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency -1 points 2 days ago That is what it is going to take, but today they are still way too protected by all the White Knight pussy-begging simps.

It\u2019s a rape fantasy. The author plays into liberal women\u2019s hate of religion and creates a fantasy world where they are sex slaves for wealthy white Christian men, whom they hate most. The fantasy of being humiliated so deeply while being held down by the man\u2019s older (and supposedly less attractive) wife is extremely titillating for them. It\u2019s the same impulse as men who fantasize about being sexually dominated in the most humiliating way: in the butt while dressed as a woman. permalink parent award report block reply Burneraccountno4 4 points 2 days ago while being held down by the man\u2019s older (and supposedly less attractive) wife They are that wife.

Instead of trying to steal their right to vote. If they're so easily manipulated, then it shouldn't be hard. permalink parent award report block reply Transparency 4 points 2 days ago Their nature is conformance (security) combined with being anti-establishment (rebellion). First thing to understand about women is that their brains can easily hold disassociated thought processes without any cognitive dissonance. That's why they often don't make sense and frequently fail at logic. Plus, conformance + scatterbrained leads them to think too much while not actually thinking at all. The more women that go in 1 direction... the more women that follow. So, say the muslims took over, killed all these White Knight pussy-begging simps, and started harassing and beating the women to get them inline... in short order: more and more women would start getting inline without having to be harassed or beaten. Of course, they would not be allowed to vote, but that is irrelevant to the point. Just look at Afghanistan after  the US withdrawal: Women complained and cried out for help, but, ultimately, they got their asses inline and obeyed. Why doesn't the right manipulate them into voting conservatively then? The short answer is: Because men let feminism go waaaaaay too far. Why? Because with prosperity men were more focused on fucking the women, than running and protecting the culture/society. permalink parent award report block reply Oodles 3 points 2 days ago Because they are also gullible, emotional, innumerate, and filled with suicidal empathy, whereas the right runs on logic and facts The right pitches You have to work hard to get what you want and people who do not work hard will not get everything they want The left pitches The government will give everything to everyone, so even the dumbest, laziest, criminal will get everything they want so they won\u2019t be a criminal anymore Which pitch do you think is the most attractive to the emotionally manipulatable demographic? permalink parent award report block reply GatoradeJeb 1 points 2 days ago If trump was real and not controlled he would have banned racemixing permalink parent award report block reply BecauseYoudBeInJail 5 points 2 days ago RAPE ME HARDER PAPI permalink award report block reply Psarg 5 points 2 days ago I can smell the cat piss permalink award report block reply MythArcana 5 points 2 days ago So, they want more rape is what they're saying. permalink award report block reply Transparency 2 points 2 days ago Yes. permalink parent award report block reply DlanOdcammron 4 points 2 days ago TIL Sydney Sweeney was on that show \ud83e\udd23 permalink award report block reply lifeisahologram 7 points 2 days ago Damn was she one of the characters that the government assigns you to breed?

And you will desire to control your husband, but he will rule over you.\u201d It's right there in the second half of that verse women being so damn contrary is written right into the curse. It's right there in a woman's psychology to destroy her man and embrace that which destroys him unless he rules over her in a godly manner. permalink award report block reply Transparency 2 points 2 days ago Women are hard wired for it.

She started saying after the show came out that Gilead is reflective of what Trump and MAGA want.  The left literally told itself a horror story based on a fundamentalist regime that rose up after a leftist Soviet backed revolution and tried to blame it on people who opposed the leftist revolution, opposed the USSR Breshnev doctrine, opposed gender apartheid in from  totally different country with a totally different civilization and now play theatrics based on a total reversal of objective reality. permalink award report block reply Freedomnuggs 1 points 2 days ago Women on the left are cringelords permalink award report block reply Gildoom 1 points 2 days ago Is this the left's version of the Patriot Front?

That's why they often don't make sense and frequently fail at logic. Plus, conformance + scatterbrained leads them to think too much while not actually thinking at all. The more women that go in 1 direction... the more women that follow. So, say the muslims took over, killed all these White Knight pussy-begging simps, and started harassing and beating the women to get them inline... in short order: more and more women would start getting inline without having to be harassed or beaten. Of course, they would not be allowed to vote, but that is irrelevant to the point. Just look at Afghanistan after  the US withdrawal: Women complained and cried out for help, but, ultimately, they got their asses inline and obeyed. Why doesn't the right manipulate them into voting conservatively then? The short answer is: Because men let feminism go waaaaaay too far. Why? Because with prosperity men were more focused on fucking the women, than running and protecting the culture/society. permalink parent award report block reply\nOodles 3 points 2 days ago Because they are also gullible, emotional, innumerate, and filled with suicidal empathy, whereas the right runs on logic and facts The right pitches You have to work hard to get what you want and people who do not work hard will not get everything they want The left pitches The government will give everything to everyone, so even the dumbest, laziest, criminal will get everything they want so they won\u2019t be a criminal anymore Which pitch do you think is the most attractive to the emotionally manipulatable demographic? permalink parent award report block reply\nGatoradeJeb 1 points 2 days ago If trump was real and not controlled he would have banned racemixing permalink parent award report block reply\nBecauseYoudBeInJail 5 points 2 days ago RAPE ME HARDER PAPI permalink award report block reply\nPsarg 5 points 2 days ago I can smell the cat piss permalink award report block reply\nMythArcana 5 points 2 days ago So, they want more rape is what they're saying. permalink award report block reply Transparency 2 points 2 days ago Yes. permalink parent award report block reply\nTransparency 2 points 2 days ago Yes. permalink parent award report block reply\nDlanOdcammron 4 points 2 days ago TIL Sydney Sweeney was on that show \ud83e\udd23 permalink award report block reply lifeisahologram 7 points 2 days ago Damn was she one of the characters that the government assigns you to breed?

And you will desire to control your husband, but he will rule over you.\u201d It's right there in the second half of that verse women being so damn contrary is written right into the curse. It's right there in a woman's psychology to destroy her man and embrace that which destroys him unless he rules over her in a godly manner. permalink award report block reply Transparency 2 points 2 days ago Women are hard wired for it. Feminism does not create these monsters, it merely removes their shackles and opens their cages allowing them to be what they truly are.

She started saying after the show came out that Gilead is reflective of what Trump and MAGA want.  The left literally told itself a horror story based on a fundamentalist regime that rose up after a leftist Soviet backed revolution and tried to blame it on people who opposed the leftist revolution, opposed the USSR Breshnev doctrine, opposed gender apartheid in from  totally different country with a totally different civilization and now play theatrics based on a total reversal of objective reality. permalink award report block reply\nFreedomnuggs 1 points 2 days ago Women on the left are cringelords permalink award report block reply\nGildoom 1 points 2 days ago Is this the left's version of the Patriot Front?
