Please explain how you think Roundup operates: permalink award report block reply OneTypoComment 1 points 11 hours ago You literally wash it off with water. It doesn't \"absorb\" into the food or change its molecular biology. permalink parent award report block reply TGNX -2 points 11 hours ago It doesn't all \"wash off.\" It gets absorbed by the plant.

It was hard to solve, but scientists  found a subspecies of moth that had a genetic resistance to being killed by glyphosphate, the active ingredient in Roundup. So the scientists spliced that section of the month's DNA into corn and created \"Roundup  Ready\" corn. It was a huge success. So today when you consume any corn product in North America, you consume a small amount of moth DNA. permalink award report block reply staroframphansbhole 2 points 11 hours ago Gross permalink parent award report block reply FlgPole OP 0 points 1 hour ago you vill eat ze bugs.
