I told you so permalink award report block reply MediaBro -3 points 4 days ago You wil not get mass deportations because the US economy relies on their labour. The average American, and I mean genuinely the average American, who is living comfortably, isn't going to do the hard labour it takes to do the jobs needed. Of course it's because pay is terrible but really, it's because a lot of these jobs are also back breaking and the internet is a lot more fun. So Trump will mostly just target the violent ones and mostly keep the rest in the country. At least most of your illegals are Brown South and Central American Catholics and most are not violent and keep on the down low. Half these ppl are also going to join Mormon or Evangelical groups. Your actual real problem isn't really them - it's the legal migrants coming in, from your airports. Look around the neighbourhoods, where international airports are located and half are these neighborhoods are globalist slopfests.
