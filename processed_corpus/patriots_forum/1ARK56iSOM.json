We have several copies of the resulting genealogy. My father's side of the family arrived with the early Dutch settlers in the 1600s--I know the name of the boat, when and where it left, when and where it landed, and who was aboard. We are descended of Huguenots and have FIVE family members who fought with GW in the French and Indian wars and three in the revolution, two in the War of 1812, 12 in the civil war--some on both sides--1 in the SpanAm war, 3 in WWI, 5 in WWII (including dad), 2 in Gulf War 2. I am particularly fond of my grandfather, whose mom and dad passed away when he was 13. He lived with another relative who took great advantage of him, forcing him to dig coal instead of attending school. Nonetheless, he was successful, and when he met little me, fell in love and was so much fun, so kind, and he taught a wide array of man skills like carpentry. In particular, he was funny, always cracking jokes with friends and always happy. I learned these habits, incorporating them into daily life. My mom and dad remarked often: you're his spitting image. I do not hate anyone. I take everyone as an individual. But collectively? Today's immigrants are a pestilence. was eventually passed away from emphysema permalink award report block reply SimaYi 4 points 5 days ago When he was a child, my grandfather gathered spilt coal from railroad cars for 10 cents a burlap bag. permalink award report block reply irescreams 3 points 4 days ago My white German family came to NY as indentured servants to the UK monarchy in the 17th century. We only broke free by sending their son at 13 to live with the Mohawk Indians. My relatives fought in all the wars from french indian, fought with George Washington at Valley forge, survived louis and clark expedition, Japs in the pacific and battle of the bulge. Still broke and struggling.  Where is my white privilege? permalink award report block reply Michalusmichalus 3 points 5 days ago That's not hidden history.

Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that fact.  There were also a lot of white indentured servants, many of whom were children and early teenagers.  They didn't have much more freedom than slaves, but at least could look forward to an end date for their servitude (assuming they didn't die of disease first, which many did). permalink award report block reply HeavenlyTrumpets 14 points 5 days ago less than 3% of white people owned slaves.  there were also black people who owned slaves.  that is the problem with viewing slavery as some kind of historical lens through which to view white history.  the vast majority of white people did not have slaves, and the only people who benefitted were the very very few. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 7 points 5 days ago Who gives a fuck about slavery. It had been going on since the dawn of time. White people ended it wherever they ruled. Do we get thanks for that? Nope. We just have to endure our country polluted with nogs now. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora -5 points 5 days ago There was a whole lot of wealth produced by agricultural slave labor in the South.  As I pointed out, many whites also suffered as indentured servants.  And many completely free whites lived miserable lives, working themselves nearly or actually to death just trying to survive and keep a few of their healthiest children alive. Just because only a small minority of whites owned slaves doesn't mean that the wealth created by that slave labor was so minimal that it didn't make a significant contribution to \"building the US\".  The white plantation owners who accumulated significant wealth through the use of slave labor didn't keep that wealth under their mattresses.  They used it to buy goods and services, and thus directly and indirectly employed working class and middle class whites, and those whites certainly benefitted from the wealth created via slave labor. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 10 points 5 days ago SimaYi 4 points 5 days ago Any wealth created by slavery has been given back 1,000,000x from taking care of these useless creatures for centuries. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora -5 points 5 days ago Not really.  Especially since the wealth hadn't all remained in the South.  Nor was everything destroyed.  Some of my ancestors were there both before and after the Civil War.  Not aware of any who were actually slave owners, but they were pretty comfortable and weren't starting from scratch after the war. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

Lol, no one is going to acknowledge this because it has too many  implications about their situation here in the modern day.

They fought hard to feed them, house them, and keep them safe. Honestly, the Democrats should be thanked for how much empathy they had for their community.

A head of household should be enough to put a roof over a family, but sadly, through $ and dependency, we're now being forced into conditions, where you could work yourself to death and not even be able to pay your \"rent\". permalink award report block reply\nPatriotDescendant 4 points 4 days ago In the early 60's, my mom and dad paid for extensive research into our family tree. We have several copies of the resulting genealogy. My father's side of the family arrived with the early Dutch settlers in the 1600s--I know the name of the boat, when and where it left, when and where it landed, and who was aboard. We are descended of Huguenots and have FIVE family members who fought with GW in the French and Indian wars and three in the revolution, two in the War of 1812, 12 in the civil war--some on both sides--1 in the SpanAm war, 3 in WWI, 5 in WWII (including dad), 2 in Gulf War 2. I am particularly fond of my grandfather, whose mom and dad passed away when he was 13. He lived with another relative who took great advantage of him, forcing him to dig coal instead of attending school. Nonetheless, he was successful, and when he met little me, fell in love and was so much fun, so kind, and he taught a wide array of man skills like carpentry. In particular, he was funny, always cracking jokes with friends and always happy. I learned these habits, incorporating them into daily life. My mom and dad remarked often: you're his spitting image. I do not hate anyone. I take everyone as an individual. But collectively? Today's immigrants are a pestilence. was eventually passed away from emphysema permalink award report block reply\nSimaYi 4 points 5 days ago When he was a child, my grandfather gathered spilt coal from railroad cars for 10 cents a burlap bag. permalink award report block reply\nirescreams 3 points 4 days ago My white German family came to NY as indentured servants to the UK monarchy in the 17th century. We only broke free by sending their son at 13 to live with the Mohawk Indians. My relatives fought in all the wars from french indian, fought with George Washington at Valley forge, survived louis and clark expedition, Japs in the pacific and battle of the bulge. Still broke and struggling.  Where is my white privilege? permalink award report block reply\nMichalusmichalus 3 points 5 days ago That's not hidden history.

Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that fact.  There were also a lot of white indentured servants, many of whom were children and early teenagers.  They didn't have much more freedom than slaves, but at least could look forward to an end date for their servitude (assuming they didn't die of disease first, which many did). permalink award report block reply HeavenlyTrumpets 14 points 5 days ago less than 3% of white people owned slaves.  there were also black people who owned slaves.  that is the problem with viewing slavery as some kind of historical lens through which to view white history.  the vast majority of white people did not have slaves, and the only people who benefitted were the very very few. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 7 points 5 days ago Who gives a fuck about slavery. It had been going on since the dawn of time. White people ended it wherever they ruled. Do we get thanks for that? Nope. We just have to endure our country polluted with nogs now. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora -5 points 5 days ago There was a whole lot of wealth produced by agricultural slave labor in the South.  As I pointed out, many whites also suffered as indentured servants.  And many completely free whites lived miserable lives, working themselves nearly or actually to death just trying to survive and keep a few of their healthiest children alive. Just because only a small minority of whites owned slaves doesn't mean that the wealth created by that slave labor was so minimal that it didn't make a significant contribution to \"building the US\".  The white plantation owners who accumulated significant wealth through the use of slave labor didn't keep that wealth under their mattresses.  They used it to buy goods and services, and thus directly and indirectly employed working class and middle class whites, and those whites certainly benefitted from the wealth created via slave labor. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 10 points 5 days ago SimaYi 4 points 5 days ago Any wealth created by slavery has been given back 1,000,000x from taking care of these useless creatures for centuries. permalink parent award report block reply Deplora -5 points 5 days ago Not really.
