Is the perp a former legislator, formerly transgender, both? Would only be half surprised if some states actually had a position of \"transgender state legislator\". Guess the news headline GWP screenshotted makes it clearer, currently transgender and a former legistlator In 2023, Laughton, 41, of Nashua, New Hampshire, and his former intimate partner and daycare worker, Lindsay Groves, were charged with child exploitation. Another confusingly worded former, one would hop Groves was terminated, and perhaps was. Groves admitted to taking sexually explicit photos of children at the daycare center and sending them to Laughton. Laughton was charged with one count of sexual exploitation of children \u2013 and aiding and abetting, according to the DOJ. \u201cAccording to the charging documents, a preliminary forensic review of Groves\u2019 cellphone allegedly revealed over 10,000 text messages between Laughton and Groves that included discussion about, and transfer of, explicit photographs that Groves had taken of children while employed at Creative Minds daycare \u2013 including at least four sexually explicit images of children who appear to be approximately three to five years old, as well as explicit descriptions of sex with each other and others, including children ,\u201d the DOJ said. Sounds like they should be interviewing children for multiple rape charges instead of settling for single child abuse and child pornography charge. 15 years and up to 30 years in prison, at least five years 15 years, with good prison behavior and parole could be out in a third, which makes the 5 years.  Keep looking into a rape charge, it sounds like they committed them. They need to be kept away. permalink award report block reply 16BeatsAOne 1 points 5 days ago former transgender mentally ill man New Hampshire state legislator Fixed it. permalink parent award report block reply BaronFalcon 8 points 5 days ago Groomers, all of them. permalink award report block reply BillGateCanSuckIt 6 points 5 days ago That's an ugly pizza hut permalink award report block reply anotherthing 2 points 5 days ago Buffalo Bill passed better. permalink parent award report block reply makenomistake 1 points 5 days ago </>thread permalink parent award report block reply COLDWARPATRIOT55 3 points 5 days ago Former transgender or former state legislator? permalink award report block reply Johnkimble111 3 points 5 days ago There\u2019s no such thing as \u201ctransgender\u201d permalink parent award report block reply TGNX 2 points 5 days ago Every time. permalink award report block reply Beeboy 2 points 5 days ago That's demoRATS for you!!!
