I think you wanted to say \"communist\".

It's talked about in Acts 2 It absolutely is not. Acts 2 does not mention communism.  What it is describing is wealthy people (and some maybe not as wealthy) CHOOSING to give of their wealth to share it around among people. That's not Communism, it's charity.  Capitalists already do this. Communism would have been if the Apostles got a bunch of swords and worked for the Roman tax collectors, going door to door taking people's money from them.  Then they would build a palace and feed poor people from the back porch with what ever was left over from lunch. Communism requires godlessness.  It is a Luciferian doctrine. Acts 2 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 1 day ago Communism isn't determined by its name. It's determined by what it is. Communism is based on the \"commune\". The group of people in Acts 2 were what we call a commune today. And communism isn't defined by taking money and property because they are not unique in that. It's how they say they will distribute it. If government forcing people to give their money and property is communism, then we already live in communism and so does the rest of the Western world.
