Can you tell me what the penalty for paying off a 50-year mortgage in 15 years in? Can you tell me in general what the penalty for pre-payment of mortgage is? permalink award report block reply Hantif 1 points 3 days ago My parents lived in their home well after it was paid off, I've paid off two mortgages. We're not all moving every 4 years. Edit: autocorrupt error permalink parent award report block reply panic86 1 points 3 days ago Most homeowners move every 8-12 years, depending on who you ask. Damn close to zero primary residence mortgages have a pre-payment penalty anymore. Those contract terms ended after the 2008 housing crash. Nowadays, basically only investment properties or subprime loans ever have a pre-payment penalty. permalink parent award report block reply feelips 1 points 3 days ago Living in a city with very high property tax, it would be advantageous for me to have a 50 year mortgage. The caveat would be that I am moving to another state in 7 years. It isn\u2019t unusual here to see a mortgage payment of $2,000 a month where $800, or even $1,000, of that monthly payment is property taxes. My plan is to retire in 7 years and move to another state that has low housing costs and low cost of living while living off two pensions and VA disability. If I can lower my current mortgage payment by 25% or more by refinancing to  50 year mortgage, that\u2019s more cash in my pocket later when I sell this house to buy in another state. Having said that, I would not want to be young and sign a 50 year mortgage! permalink award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 3 days ago If I can lower my current mortgage payment by 25% or more by refinancing to 50 year mortgage Assuming the same interest rate of 6.5% (which it won't be, longer term mortgages are always higher rates) you would lower it by about 11%. permalink parent award report block reply NamendaBiden 1 points 3 days ago \"Having said that, I would not want to be young and sign a 50 year mortgage!\" Meh.  Thats what refinancing is for.  I didnt want to be in a 30 year.  So, when rates came down, I refinanced into a 20.  Still gonna pay that off about 5 years early by throwing extra $ at the principal every month. permalink parent award report block reply Trajano 1 points 3 days ago Are you proposing to transfer the parents' debt to the children? permalink award report block reply Hantif 1 points 3 days ago No, they're proposing transferring a paid off property to the children, like we have for 250+ years. Inheritance is not the transfer of debt. Multi-generational ownership of land used to be the norm, around here they're designated \"century farms\" because they've been owned by the same family for over 100 years. permalink parent award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 3 days ago A $500,000 fifty year mortgage would only save $150 a month over a 30 year mortgage.
