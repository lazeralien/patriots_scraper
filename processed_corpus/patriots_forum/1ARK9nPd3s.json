The elite and politicians and bureaucrats have stolen trillions of dollars that they currently have in their pockets\u2026.. The only way out of our debt problem is to create a new currency and make everybody justify the wealth that they currently have! For example, take a billionaire and make them justify their ownership of billions of dollars when they did zero other than manipulate the system!.. we have black market money from cartels dealing drugs that have hundreds of billions of dollars in cash just laying around what did they do for it? Nothing they didn\u2019t pay taxes. They did nothing but they have access to our economy and do not contribute to the debt. permalink parent award report block reply genericamerican69 2 points 2 hours ago Trump bought 10% of Intel.
