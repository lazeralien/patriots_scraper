During that same time this judge will have gone soft on hundreds of other violent criminals, resulting in hundreds if not thousands of additional victims. permalink parent award report block reply StCharlie 3 points 4 days ago We build a website.

But the question hanging in the air is this - like with the china virus, with doctors doing stupid and criminal acts in harmony with their governments, all using the same messaging and lies all at the same time clearly shows terrorist and mass murder collusion. And we probably have a very good guess as to the terrorist groups and figureheads for which the treasonous world leaders subscribe to for this ideology. Who is coordinating judges and police and law enforcement and governments all over the western world to conduct terrorist operations against their citizens using enemy foreigners as the weapon? The same names who did the same thing with the china virus? You dont hang the lower totem-pole thugs and brutes without getting the identity of their command and higher ups first, by any way you can extract this information. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 4 days ago Who? Cuomo was the first to enforce restricting medicine from sick people who needed it. 40+ Governors followed his precedent. Lockdowns started on April Fool's Day, 2020. The public cooperated with this on the basis of it only being for two weeks, which would have ended on 4/15. When that didn't happen, We the People had the duty to remove 40+ Governors from Office, physically. All anybody here would talk about is \"if you do that they'll shoot you!\" So what? It's exactly what watering the tree of liberty requires. Why do you think the Summer of love began on Memorial Day, with professional protests already organized, in place, and ready to go? It put a hard time limit on our ability to do this. We are not in a stronger position now. Doctors and those actually delivering medical care to people aren't the ones who imposed the tyranny, government officials and hospital administrators were. Fauci on top. His crimes were the same as what he did to turn AIDS into an epidemic. State medical boards were used as an excuse by most Governors; almost gotta respect Cuomo and Whitmer for at least taking responsibility for their actions instead of hiding behind medical boards like everyone else. Noem single handedly put a stop to it in her State. permalink parent award report block reply TearsAficionado 2 points 4 days ago The time frame is too slow. permalink parent award report block reply StCharlie 4 points 4 days ago I hate to say it, but every time this happens there should be an outpouring of people that reach out to the family.

It put a hard time limit on our ability to do this. We are not in a stronger position now. Doctors and those actually delivering medical care to people aren't the ones who imposed the tyranny, government officials and hospital administrators were. Fauci on top. His crimes were the same as what he did to turn AIDS into an epidemic. State medical boards were used as an excuse by most Governors; almost gotta respect Cuomo and Whitmer for at least taking responsibility for their actions instead of hiding behind medical boards like everyone else. Noem single handedly put a stop to it in her State. permalink parent award report block reply\nSicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 4 days ago Who? Cuomo was the first to enforce restricting medicine from sick people who needed it. 40+ Governors followed his precedent. Lockdowns started on April Fool's Day, 2020. The public cooperated with this on the basis of it only being for two weeks, which would have ended on 4/15. When that didn't happen, We the People had the duty to remove 40+ Governors from Office, physically. All anybody here would talk about is \"if you do that they'll shoot you!\" So what? It's exactly what watering the tree of liberty requires. Why do you think the Summer of love began on Memorial Day, with professional protests already organized, in place, and ready to go?

Many people would like to help these families financially or \"otherwise\".  There are many sites that show layoffs.  We need to build a site that shows illegal murders and how to contact the victims family.  I'm not explicitly saying people would want to help you \"resolve\" the outcome, but there are many people that would like to \"help\". permalink parent award report block reply\nMintap 37 points 5 days ago Kill him now.
