It's full of amazing autistic brainfarts from the Cato Libertarian.  And he was cheered on by the autist libertarians in the crowd.     Dave Smith responded with common sense-- which was lost on a crowd with no common sense.  But won the larger audience outside that auditorium.

They would often walk away with anything not bolted to the floor if nobody noticed; and if you did notice they'd blame you for it. If you walked away with something of theirs however, they'd get upset and probably bash your face in.

Really pissed me off though. permalink award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 35 points 6 hours ago Funny how Americans can't do the jobs and training them would be cumbersome, so we need to bring in half a million foreigners from a hostile nation and train them instead. From the same admin that is justifying everything with \"muh national security.\" permalink parent award report block reply gunteh 25 points 5 hours ago Gaslighting is telling someone you're \"tough on immigration\" while also saying \"Americans can't do what these foreigners can\", change my mind... permalink parent award report block reply Madnote1984 7 points 5 hours ago The truth of the matter is, they want dirt cheap labor. There are plenty of competent Americans to do those jobs, but they expect a certain amount of pay. So the solution is to import foreigners who may be somewhat competent, but will work suicide hours for hardly no pay. permalink parent award report block reply TheTelltaleFly 6 points 4 hours ago And get their housing and food and schooling subsidized by American taxpayers because, again, they\u2019re working for shit pay. But all that never hits the company\u2019s bottom line so it\u2019s a win win for them. permalink parent award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 4 points 5 hours ago Yup permalink parent award report block reply newestofnew 15 points 5 hours ago its incredible that they think they can psyop people into believing that their children with unrealized potential because of failed and flawed education system are inferior to third worlders so inferior that its not even worth giving them a chance. this is winning messaging? permalink parent award report block reply GatoradeJeb 7 points 5 hours ago Its because he exposed his hatred of White man and his desire to replace us with browns permalink parent award report block reply tt777 4 points 5 hours ago Trump is a business man first.

He's also dealing with some financial swamp creatures still (Powell comes immediately to mind). With all that said, Trump has the defibrillators on full tilt, and if he can't get America back up on its feet, then we're screwed no matter who's in office next time around. permalink parent award report block reply YouEssAye 11 points 5 hours ago He's also dealing with some financial swamp creatures He's actively campaigning for Lindsey Graham. Can we dispense with this idea that there is any intention to drain the swamp? permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... gunteh 5 points 5 hours ago Yeah, but just because it's legal doesn't make it ethical. If Trump said 50 year mortgages are legal, that doesn't make it ethical to give banks the ability to force people into 50 year mortgages with \"hey, look at your monthly payments now, much cheaper than 30 year mortgages, huh? Wanna go for the lower monthly payment?\" If you've ever been on an 84-month car loan, you'll know the pain of being stuck with that monthly payment for that long. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 2 points 4 hours ago He should be concerned about impeachment if he loses the midterms. permalink parent award report block reply Megaboom2025 2 points 3 hours ago I think he\u2019s the father in law of Israel first permalink parent award report block reply Long_time_lurker 2 points 4 hours ago It was a word salad but it sounded like he was talking about the original justification, which was that they'd do jobs the companies can't find an American who can do in high end science or whatever. The problem as we've seen is that the program is gamed to death and companies like them for being essentially slave labor that can't quit.  This goes hand-in-hand with being cheaper. So they post stupid job requirements on a message board nobody sees and get their desired candidate, possibly via internal transfer, instead of ever trying to hire American, and they get them for cheap and know they won't quit right away because they cannot. Thus you see some random bigcorp hiring people for $50k who normally make 2-3x that much. permalink parent award report block reply load 6 more comments... bejeavis 44 points 6 hours ago Vivek is dead to this site for saying the exact same thing.

Let's reform the H1B visa system and limit the numbers arriving but let's still let in a few. In the meantime, let's set up a 5 yr plan, where we find American kids that are patriotic and love the country and want to be given a chance to prove themselves - let's focus on those kids, give them a chance to prosper and from there, we figure out a way to continue uplifting more American-born kids\" This is how you win both sides. You show love of nation, love of the people you grew up with, love of even the people you think are lazy and love of the people who just want to show they too can work towards something great. But, nope, let's call Americans lazy and too stupid to do jobs in the very fields their own parents and grandparents helped create and set up. permalink parent award report block reply bejeavis 1 points 22 minutes ago Accurate permalink parent award report block reply CommietownUSA 29 points 5 hours ago How to lose the midterms and your legacy in one sentence: permalink award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 22 points 6 hours ago They're also not white. permalink award report block reply tribunabessica 10 points 5 hours ago And never will be. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 8 points 5 hours ago Until they commit a violent crime and we need to classify race permalink parent award report block reply Thrilly 17 points 5 hours ago They start by stealing our jobs.

Or let the businesses outsource to countries with slave labor. For the government, the former is preferable to the later. permalink award report block reply TheTelltaleFly 6 points 4 hours ago What\u2019s the point of having the manufacturing here if they aren\u2019t hiring Americans? Just to pollute our fucking water and invade our schools with their litters of kids who don\u2019t speak English? permalink parent award report block reply aaafirefly123 1 points 3 hours ago Well for the government, the point of keeping the businesses here is to build and maintain manufacturing infrastructure while denying said infrastructure to China. Every business that outsources to China empowers China just a little bit more. permalink parent award report block reply PDWUsername 2 points 5 hours ago They are cheaper per hour because they're willing to work 15 hours a day on the same salary as an American to make enough money to support their family of 10 back home. permalink award report block reply popcultmember 6 points 4 hours ago I dont buy this.

We all have to stick up and fight for ourselves. Government nor the politicians will help or protect us. Honestly questioning whether Trump is becoming senile. His handlers told him to insult his base now? Trump clearly loves Israel more than the USA. What happened to no more wars, Donnie boy? You bombed Iran. Peace is supposed to the prize! This is why I am a Ron Paul libertarian. I can take care of myself. Just want to make sure government is neutered so it can't hurt me. permalink award report block reply Eshasta 2 points 50 minutes ago Depends which Iones were looking at. There are millions of inner-city Street rats who aren't talented enough to do anything. If we isolate the black community, I think 40% aren't employed full-time or care to be.

We haven\u2019t done a lot of these manufacturing things for a very long time.\nThe goal here is to get the manufacturing know how back into the American population using temporary labor that will be sent back in 4 to 7 years - we need training. Anyone in business knows that your general American guy out there is a total dumbass -sorry but that\u2019s just the truth. Ever hire a contractor? Most of them don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. And yes, I\u2019m talking about the white guys too.

If you walked away with something of theirs however, they'd get upset and probably bash your face in. These values are wholly incompatible with ours; but because of greed and malice, they're forced upon us. permalink parent award report block reply\nkeeman 2 points 4 hours ago And the only loyalty to the company they have is the H1B not being easily transferable to another employer.
