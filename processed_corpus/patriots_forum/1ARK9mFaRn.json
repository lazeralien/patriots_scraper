At least no one was killed or hurt. permalink parent award report block reply Nibba2 6 points 18 hours ago I remember watching a documentary on this recently. The engineer in charge of anchoring the bridge I guess said the ground on both ends of it were terrible ground for a bridge. He said it was very soft and spongy and would fall apart easily. This is why they decided to use those towers at each end with cables that went far out behind them. I don\u2019t remember them showing how they were anchored in the back. Looks like it wasn\u2019t good there either, or sufficient. Or the pillars holding the initial bridge didn\u2019t have such a good time on the soft ground. permalink award report block reply Zelda 3 points 17 hours ago Reminds me of Frank Lloyd\u2019s falling waters. The contractor said f this and added extra rebar.

The authorities have already started investigating the Woo-Shu engineering agency responsible for the initial surveys and geo-statistical analysis. They're pointing out that one particular engineer Ching Chong failed to use the official General Tso Chicken logs for landslide probability. He was taken to Moo-Shu prison for interrogation. permalink award report block reply cd3dog 3 points 18 hours ago Oops.

Too bad probably will never get the info of what the corruption:incompetance:bad luck proportions here. Knowing the chineese, officially it will be \"nothing wrong happened\", unofficially some mid level heads will roll, and the top dogs responsible may get scot-free Hope all the belt and road partners are taking notes. permalink award report block reply AR_MAGA 2 points 9 hours ago Another huge source of H1Bs that we forgot to mention here. permalink award report block reply freebirdie 1 points 4 hours ago Better bring 600k young ones over here to learn exactly what makes American bridges fail. \ud83d\ude44 permalink award report block reply ltbadpuppy 1 points 7 hours ago Called it permalink award report block reply corntortilla 1 points 3 hours ago Fuck China and all that, but if you want to talk shit about their construction failures, you might want to remember we\u2019ve had plenty of our own. permalink award report block reply Maximumheight 1 points 12 hours ago Caused by landslides due to a freak natural disaster unrelated to its engineering.

Then imagine other countries laughing at us for it. \"But, our infrastructure is...\" Yeah, whatever. I'm with everyone else on deporting and wanting to MAGA.  But taking joy and making comedy of things like this this errs on the side of evil.   There is no legitimate reason any of you have to hold so much personal hate against their attempts to improve their cities and living conditions, of which improving traffic falls squarely under those categories. While you on the other hand make fun of civilizations that still live in mud huts. You can't have it both ways.  Either you want other countries to improve and raise themselves up to the modern world or you don't.  Which is it? Success = People stay in their own countries. Failure = Lets invade America So laugh it up. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_building_and_structure_collapses You'll notice that the US is in that list... a few times. permalink parent award report block reply semsem 1 points 10 hours ago That, and the fact that- despite the press- the DC-10 and the MD-11 actually have a pretty unremarkable accident rate. The press has had a hard-on for tri-jet crashes for more than fifty years, for some damn reason- sort of like their breathless coverage of shark attacks. In the ocean. Near sandbars and river mouths. Where the sharks live and hunt. I'll spitball that it's down to there being lots of pictures and video of tri-jet crashes rather than any specific fixation on tri-jets themselves or any actual glut of tri-jet incidents. If Tenerife weren't in fog, or Northwest didn't manage to land their 74 with hard-over rudder, or the JAL that lost its whole vertical stab had flown into- say- Rainier instead of Fuji, or Pan Am 103 had blown up and rained debris in daylight instead of nighttime, the press would probably shit on the 747 as a  death trap instead to this day. Just depends on what can be endlessly looped for shock value and thoroughly ignorant voice-over commentary. It's telling that even on this last incident, press had on lawyers as experts, and consulted with pilots decades out of proficiency to the point that they claimed the MD-11 has a flight engineer. (For who don't get it, that's like going to a mechanic with your 2022 Toyota Camry and being told you need a new distributor and a carburetor rebuild, and he wants to teach you how to use the choke- for a nominal fee, of course. Instantly reveals he's either brazenly full of shit, or such a damn outdated graybeard that he hasn't kept up with current engineering and operation since before AMC ceased to be.) permalink parent award report block reply ciaramella_is_gay -7 points 19 hours ago LoL talk shit all you want but China has built out their country at a pretty fucking amazing pace.

The engineer in charge of anchoring the bridge I guess said the ground on both ends of it were terrible ground for a bridge. He said it was very soft and spongy and would fall apart easily. This is why they decided to use those towers at each end with cables that went far out behind them. I don\u2019t remember them showing how they were anchored in the back. Looks like it wasn\u2019t good there either, or sufficient. Or the pillars holding the initial bridge didn\u2019t have such a good time on the soft ground. permalink award report block reply Zelda 3 points 17 hours ago Reminds me of Frank Lloyd\u2019s falling waters.

The press has had a hard-on for tri-jet crashes for more than fifty years, for some damn reason- sort of like their breathless coverage of shark attacks. In the ocean. Near sandbars and river mouths. Where the sharks live and hunt. I'll spitball that it's down to there being lots of pictures and video of tri-jet crashes rather than any specific fixation on tri-jets themselves or any actual glut of tri-jet incidents. If Tenerife weren't in fog, or Northwest didn't manage to land their 74 with hard-over rudder, or the JAL that lost its whole vertical stab had flown into- say- Rainier instead of Fuji, or Pan Am 103 had blown up and rained debris in daylight instead of nighttime, the press would probably shit on the 747 as a  death trap instead to this day. Just depends on what can be endlessly looped for shock value and thoroughly ignorant voice-over commentary. It's telling that even on this last incident, press had on lawyers as experts, and consulted with pilots decades out of proficiency to the point that they claimed the MD-11 has a flight engineer. (For who don't get it, that's like going to a mechanic with your 2022 Toyota Camry and being told you need a new distributor and a carburetor rebuild, and he wants to teach you how to use the choke- for a nominal fee, of course.
