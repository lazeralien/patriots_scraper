That looks like SNAP shopping to me. I mentioned this in another post, just above this one, but she's paying over twice as much for those tuna packages as the canned price. She could get a 1lb4oz pack of canned tuna for less than $4, and those 8 packages are nearly $10. The difference is .08oz of tuna, which you'll probably lose more than that in the corners of those foil packs.

Seems pretty simple to me. A generation or two ago, the diet may have been poor people food (rice, beans, lower quality cuts of meat, home grown vegetables, homemade bread...), but people were much healthier.  Sweets, etc, were luxury items enjoyed sparingly and irregularly.  Now they're staples. No wonder we have problems. Learn to choose food wisely.  Learn to cook.

Imagine how much rice, dry beans, canned food, potatoes, onions, and dry pasta you could get for $115! permalink parent award report block reply Stossels_stach 6 points 6 days ago That's good eatin', in my opinion. Not to mention the massive salt bomb all those packaged foods contain, along with chemical preservatives and gmo's. permalink parent award report block reply Givesgunstogrannies 5 points 6 days ago Ramen is awful.  You are right.  She is feeding her family garbage.   This doesn't include dinners i.e. fast food permalink parent award report block reply Tikk 10 points 6 days ago Notice it's almost exclusively named brand items. permalink award report block reply punkalicious 9 points 6 days ago A 10 lbs bag of chicken leg quarters is $8.90 at my local Food Lion. Rice, beans, potatoes, bananas, etc are cheap as fuck. Stop eating processed, packaged junk. Dr Pepper? Yeah, soda has gotten surprisingly expensive. I like a little caffeine in the morning but hate coffee. Used to drink soda but now I use water enhancers with caffeine in a little squeeze bottle. Way more economical. permalink award report block reply learntocode 6 points 6 days ago Soda is himan rat poison. Not worth it. permalink parent award report block reply SquatchNDenver 4 points 6 days ago 100 tea bags two buck $3 for sugar\nwe only add to take out the bitter nothing beats Ice tea!!! oh and i hae to have a dollar lime squirt bottle too!! $6.00 for drinks for two for two weeks. NO SODA at home. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 4 points 5 days ago And tea isn't hard to make either. Just a giant jar, fill with water, toss in 6-8 tea bags depending on the size of the jar, add sugar if you want, and set it out in the sun for a few hours. permalink parent award report block reply BaldyGull 3 points 5 days ago I get the gallon tea bags now. I pay a markup, but it is worth it to me. You can skip the sun tea too. My hot water is hot enough I can get a pot of hot water straight from the faucet and set it on the counter for an hour to brew. When I pour my last glass of tea I get fresh tea brewing and a gallon of water (and my sugar) chilling in the fridge. Next time I need a drink just mixed the tea and water and pour. permalink parent award report block reply BaldyGull 2 points 5 days ago I suspect soda prices are propped up by SNAP. It is like college loans. When you have access to funds you aren't looking at the cost. Of course college debt has to be paid back but short sighted 18 year olds don't often account for that. SNAP's only limitation is allotment and they are allotted more than they need so they buy this junk and drive up the prices because they are not price sensitive. permalink parent award report block reply Formerlurker92 7 points 6 days ago You are unemployed. Fucking cook! permalink award report block reply crashdaddy 7 points 6 days ago Spends $115 -- the only food she buys is avocados and potatoes. permalink award report block reply OpusX 6 points 6 days ago Just made myself a \"poor man's\" dinner the other night of spanish red rice and onions served with pinto beans, fresh salsa and avocado. Didn't spend more than $20 and made at least 8-10+ helpings. Don't get me wrong, the cost of groceries is absurd right now, but that doesn't mean you can't be frugal either. permalink award report block reply Moebius 5 points 6 days ago DIY Food Kit:  Lasts 30+ days 20 lbs of Rice:  $11.14 20 lbs of Pinto Beans:  $14.94 1 lb Salt Pork:  $7.92 20 lbs Flour:  $17.98 4 Oz Active Dry Yeast:  $5.48 22 Oz Baking Powder:  $4.97 64 Oz Peanut Butter:  $6.47 32 Oz Raw Honey:  $10.97 permalink award report block reply Reefay 3 points 6 days ago I don't really see a pound of pork lasting for 30 days. Maybe 5 pounds so they can cut it up and make meals out of it permalink parent award report block reply Moebius 6 points 6 days ago Salt Pork.  It's for flavoring the Beans.  You only need a small piece about half an ounce. While i agree more is better, if  you want more Pork then get a Job... permalink parent award report block reply Reefay 3 points 6 days ago But muh free gibs! permalink parent award report block reply Rerun1Central 5 points 6 days ago No food permalink award report block reply Maxdady01 5 points 6 days ago I'm old but lunch consisted of bologna sandwiches, water, and if we were lucky some potato chips.

That shit is drugs disguised as food. permalink parent award report block reply reversethefraud 4 points 6 days ago yeah but they did get a thing of Dr Pepper, and a thing of cereal which aint that bad, and when you throw in the ice creams, well I think you'd agree it aint all that bad. permalink parent award report block reply sir_swaggage 4 points 6 days ago Underrated kek permalink parent award report block reply CleanUpPhillyTrump24 4 points 6 days ago Big Ag needs to be banned from lobbying Congress. permalink parent award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty 3 points 6 days ago zero meat except bagged tuna packets permalink parent award report block reply SquatchNDenver 4 points 6 days ago I noticed she didn't mention the ranch dressing bottle.\nno eggs ... no milk ...huh? permalink award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty 4 points 6 days ago no meat (tuna packets don't count) permalink parent award report block reply Hangmhigh 4 points 6 days ago I bet thats 8 pounds of sugar there. permalink award report block reply FerkenBlerkin 4 points 6 days ago NGL I took home economics 1 year because that's where the actual females were.

OMG, veggies and rice and beans you stupid fucking dipshit moron motherfucker. permalink award report block reply FrozenEagle 3 points 6 days ago Getting rid of Home Ec. was not a mistake.

You had to do any the cleanup and dishes after you cooked. permalink parent award report block reply\nwalls4america 4 points 6 days ago My Home Ec also taught sewing with a sewing machine, knitting, crocheting, and macrame. In my second year of Home Ec we actually had two boys in our class. The first year, it was all girls. permalink parent award report block reply\nStossels_stach 10 points 6 days ago This is your reminder that you can live off potatoes alone for months permalink award report block reply Antenna OP 8 points 6 days ago Just what I was thinking.

Rice, beans, potatoes, bananas, etc are cheap as fuck. Stop eating processed, packaged junk. Dr Pepper? Yeah, soda has gotten surprisingly expensive. I like a little caffeine in the morning but hate coffee. Used to drink soda but now I use water enhancers with caffeine in a little squeeze bottle. Way more economical. permalink award report block reply learntocode 6 points 6 days ago Soda is himan rat poison.

I pay a markup, but it is worth it to me. You can skip the sun tea too. My hot water is hot enough I can get a pot of hot water straight from the faucet and set it on the counter for an hour to brew. When I pour my last glass of tea I get fresh tea brewing and a gallon of water (and my sugar) chilling in the fridge. Next time I need a drink just mixed the tea and water and pour. permalink parent award report block reply BaldyGull 2 points 5 days ago I suspect soda prices are propped up by SNAP. It is like college loans. When you have access to funds you aren't looking at the cost. Of course college debt has to be paid back but short sighted 18 year olds don't often account for that. SNAP's only limitation is allotment and they are allotted more than they need so they buy this junk and drive up the prices because they are not price sensitive. permalink parent award report block reply\nlearntocode 6 points 6 days ago Soda is himan rat poison.
