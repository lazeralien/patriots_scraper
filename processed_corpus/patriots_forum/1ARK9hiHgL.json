They are an agitprop organization designed to deceive and propagandize the masses.    They deceive by giving half truths or a hard left spin on all information they report and studiously omitting or dismissing any information that doesn't support or bolster the narrative they want to put out.  They propagandize by highlighting issues and concerns whether real or false, that fall into the demographics groups they have deemed oppressed while curtailing any and all concerns from demographics they have deemed are oppressors. This is how we get stories about poor laid off Federal Employees without putting it into context regarding how much the Federal bureaucracy has expanded and how much money that bureaucracy is handing out to various causes voters never knew about or wouldn't have voted for.    It's also why we get a stories about illegal alien gang members cast as \"Maryland Dad\" but we don't ever hear from the white and asian guys who lost their jobs to unqualified H1B hires. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 4 points 2 days ago The Federal Government will spend $7 Trillion dollars.

It's on the American people to be awake and stop believing the Deep State hype that we're the good guys of the world... Therefore.. we don't have to worry as much about our government as people in other countries have to worry about their governments..... Not nearly enough Americans want to face the truth.... And until more people wake up and are as angry as some of us have been for quite awhile.. It's absolutely foolish and naive to think that all of the sudden government officials are all going to do the right thing because we managed to miraculously elect one decent person as POTUS And it's childish for people to pout and invent  names like Scam Bondi.... and dumb phrases like... two more weeks..... Because they think there's some kind of shortcut to fixing a government that's supposed to be by for and of the people...when the vast majority of the country are asleep and don't want to be bothered thinking about unpleasant things permalink parent award report block reply RINOssuck 5 points 2 days ago None of this is new.

And how to perform the excisions. Alex Jones will be feasting on this. As will Steve Bannon. Tying it all back to pot-bellied interdimensional goblins (code) and the CCP might hide how our greatest ally (code) has at least one of it's corrupted tentacles in the wrong cookie jar. data republican may be in danger if she keeps outing these points, I hope others (we) can connect some dots outside of her feed to shield her. permalink award report block reply KernalMustard 1 points 2 days ago No shit really?

At \u201ccoffee hour\u201d after services they\u2019re starting to recognize and talk among themselves to the effect that the current Democrat party is a massive criminal enterprise. Not the \u201cgood guys\u201d protecting \u201cdecent people\u201d from the \u201cgreedy\u201d Orange Man. The framing of Democrats as compassionate protectors of the downtrodden is in shreds among these people. Not saying they\u2019re becoming pro-Trump,  nor that I\u2019d risk exposing myself as such, as I can be more persuasive when perceived as merely a disinterested observer.  I\u2019m well received there, and regarded with kindness and respect as a staunch upholder of timeless traditions.  That\u2019s a pretty effective foot in the door for persuasive engagement.   I\u2019ve sewn seeds of doubt by discussing \u201crealism\u201d\u2019 vs \u201cnominalism\u201d in terms of moral and ethical philosophy.  Getting people to evaluate their unexamined assumptions seems to be influencing their political biases.  It works because it\u2019s the truth.  They\u2019ve never before questioned their multigenerational support of Democrats.  I studiously avoid labeling Democrats as radicals or socialists, or anything else.  I also avoid positively portraying Republicans as \u201cthe good guys\u201d.   I just say all politicians are grifters. They\u2019re like athletes, only loyal to whatever team signs their paycheck. permalink award report block reply MythArcana 1 points 2 days ago She would make a fine AG, that's all I know. permalink award report block reply Twitter 1 points 2 days ago NO ONE IS BEING ARRESTED permalink award report block reply SanityGumby -2 points 2 days ago People are literally getting arrested.

Their job isn't to give information to the public or even explain what is going on.  They are an agitprop organization designed to deceive and propagandize the masses.    They deceive by giving half truths or a hard left spin on all information they report and studiously omitting or dismissing any information that doesn't support or bolster the narrative they want to put out.  They propagandize by highlighting issues and concerns whether real or false, that fall into the demographics groups they have deemed oppressed while curtailing any and all concerns from demographics they have deemed are oppressors. This is how we get stories about poor laid off Federal Employees without putting it into context regarding how much the Federal bureaucracy has expanded and how much money that bureaucracy is handing out to various causes voters never knew about or wouldn't have voted for.    It's also why we get a stories about illegal alien gang members cast as \"Maryland Dad\" but we don't ever hear from the white and asian guys who lost their jobs to unqualified H1B hires. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 4 points 2 days ago The Federal Government will spend $7 Trillion dollars.

At \u201ccoffee hour\u201d after services they\u2019re starting to recognize and talk among themselves to the effect that the current Democrat party is a massive criminal enterprise. Not the \u201cgood guys\u201d protecting \u201cdecent people\u201d from the \u201cgreedy\u201d Orange Man. The framing of Democrats as compassionate protectors of the downtrodden is in shreds among these people. Not saying they\u2019re becoming pro-Trump,  nor that I\u2019d risk exposing myself as such, as I can be more persuasive when perceived as merely a disinterested observer.  I\u2019m well received there, and regarded with kindness and respect as a staunch upholder of timeless traditions.  That\u2019s a pretty effective foot in the door for persuasive engagement.   I\u2019ve sewn seeds of doubt by discussing \u201crealism\u201d\u2019 vs \u201cnominalism\u201d in terms of moral and ethical philosophy.  Getting people to evaluate their unexamined assumptions seems to be influencing their political biases.  It works because it\u2019s the truth.  They\u2019ve never before questioned their multigenerational support of Democrats.  I studiously avoid labeling Democrats as radicals or socialists, or anything else.  I also avoid positively portraying Republicans as \u201cthe good guys\u201d.   I just say all politicians are grifters.
