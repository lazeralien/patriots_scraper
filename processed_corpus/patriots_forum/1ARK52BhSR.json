They were brainwashed to hate Trump, Americans, White men, Capitalism and accountability. And this smirking foreigner validated every one of those views while promising free shit. permalink award report block reply Iremembermypassword 19 points 6 days ago Bullseye! permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 8 points 6 days ago Yep, because it makes them feel superior and resolute. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 12 points 6 days ago Unresolved daddy issues.

Social media told them to. Women are easily led by their emotions, and social media is the perfect tool to manipulate women into believing anything, like killing her own baby is a great idea, empowering, and makes her a good person. Voting for a commie muslim is a great idea, or else you're a racist who wants poor people to starve to death. See how that works? It works on women very effectively and most don't even realize it decade after decade, generation after generation. permalink award report block reply _Sully_ 13 points 6 days ago They'd change their vote the instant it isn't convenient for them too. So telling them the truth or forming well thought-out impassioned arguments is a total waste. Just make them feel something and that's that. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 16 points 6 days ago Above all women fear ostracization. They will ALWAYS vote whichever way is deemed \u201csocially acceptable\u201d by the herd.

Got it. permalink award report block reply Jimmyprawns 8 points 6 days ago You joke but that student council bullshit is a big part of how we got to this point. Student council this, that or the other thing carries no real responsibility.  The teachers and the admin run the school.  But the titles have social value for some unknown reason.  And supposedly indicate to people who see it on a resume or college application some level of responsibility and maturity.  When it doesn't indicate shit.  Except maybe ambition and a propensity for performative bullshit. The whole process is supposed to teach kids about governments and elections but it does the opposite.  Every one learns about titles and that granting a title to someone marks them as a better.  So it isn't about giving a job to someone who can do it.  It's about selecting a person to be anointed as a better.  And the campaign process is about deciding who to give this status and privilege to.  Who 'deserves' to be the holder of a title that comes with advantages.  Who has 'earned' it. And who gives a shit if the students choose to grant 'knighthood' to a village idiot.  The administrators run the school anyway.  Enter the deep state bureaucracy and everyone having been conditioned to accept it while voting for a series of golden child dipshits running for student council bullshit. Student council elections and study body president bullshit has done more to fuck up our Republic than people realize. permalink parent award report block reply thisisatestof2 1 points 6 days ago About the only time student council is when they have some sort of impact is at the college level. Even then, it\u2019s very minimal and more of a provide suggestions to the administration, not make any major decisions. When I was in college, most of the council things were brought up for basic quality of life issues, such as, healthy parking lot shuttle surface operates. Things like that just got passed on to an effort department was handling it to see what they could do and they made the final call. permalink parent award report block reply cornpop_1988 4 points 6 days ago Simple propaganda to fool idiots like this and not knowing anything about his political background. permalink parent award report block reply RudeFrog 26 points 6 days ago If liberals knew what they were voting for they wouldn't be liberals permalink award report block reply keeptherepublic1776 6 points 6 days ago LMAO.

They'll continue to call you a racist/bigot/capitalist/insert insult here for even questioning their voting. permalink parent award report block reply Irrevincible 17 points 6 days ago They'll call it out by asking \"Why did Trump do this to New York?\". permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 7 points 6 days ago And while they pack up their shit and move to a red state because of a better job offering or more affordable housing they will never ever make the connection permalink parent award report block reply _Sully_ 4 points 6 days ago You're absolutely right. The fact is most of them aren't even gonna be the beneficiaries of the policies they sorta think he will implement. They'll be fine and that's why they vote that way. They do you a favor by making the absolute worse decisions on your behalf but their Dad will bail them out and they always know where their next meal is coming from, doordash. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 3 points 6 days ago Just like how we will never know what it was like to live in 1930s 95% White America, future generations will not know what it was like to live in a free country that wasn't run by third world foreigners. They will just assume that life sucks, and always has sucked. This is the insidious nature of generational decline. Just look at how many people don't believe we went to the moon. It is inconceivable to them that there once existed a generation of White men who could achieve the impossible. We're entering into a long period of decline that will probably mark the end of White dominance over the world that lasted 6 centuries. These past 6 centuries have been the greatest centuries of mankind, and marked its highest achievements, and greatest rise in living standards in history. It was a golden age of humanity, and it was brought low because White people lost WW2, and it ushered in the age of Judeo-Communism, an age where nothing matters but money. Nation, country, and race are \"problematic\", God is dead, and culture is nothing but types of food or some quaint dance. Everyone is now a part of the this new culture, a culture of consumption, with the values of a Walmart, your life measured in iphone iterations and subscription services. The foreigners who will come to be the majority in the country in 10 years won't care, and the White children we've left behind won't know any better, or more likely, have been programmed to believe that Whites never had a homeland, never deserved one of their own, where it was just them. The foreigners have always been with you, White man, and how dare you not seek their tribal wisdom in every aspect of your society? They will be told they are our betters, and always have been. It will take generations of suffering before White people feel the call of the blood and realize they are the masters of this world. It will take a dying away of the insidious propaganda that has poisoned our culture and a return to the thought of our people, not what the jew has told us about them. permalink parent award report block reply user2827 1 points 6 days ago Not trying to shit on your point because I agree with most of it. We wouldn't know what it was like to have lived through the 30s, and while society was far more high trust for the reason you mentioned. My grandparents lived through the depression and dust bowl, and even into their 80s still insisted on keeping a stocked pantry of canned food that could keep the family fed for several months... something about living through a period where the desperation for food had people hunting gophers or whatever might cross their path. It's hard to disagree with the dooming position that we are on a downward path that is inevitable... it's not too late for things to turn around, even though the odds that it will only be achievable through violence. The part that sparked my response is : Just look at how many people don't believe we went to the moon. It is inconceivable to them that there once existed a generation of White men who could achieve the impossible. Without making the positive claim whether or not people did go to the moon, there are many legitimate reasons to be suspicious. Even in the time of the moon landings, there was a segment of scientists who argued that it wouldn't work. The entire space race was a contrivance; pitting communism vs capitalism and technological supremacy... when the outcome was such that both sides could claim a victory in terms of firsts. There was intense national pride tied to the outcomes, on both sides. So, now people look at the circumstances and what remains and there's sufficient reason to doubt. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 1 points 5 days ago there are many legitimate reasons to be suspicious. You can see the lander, the rover, and it's tracks from low orbit. https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-all-six-apollo-moon-landing-sites/ The reason nobody believes (and it's going to get worse, like Planet of the Apes), is because it is such a monumental accomplishment that in today's world of \"supply chain issues\", 50% White population, and other retarded fuckery, it seems impossible. Even back then, blacks protested against it because they wanted that money spent on gibs, not human achievement of the grandest order. The moon was worshiped as a goddess by tribes people who now control our culture, and White men put a flag on it. If White nations had stayed White, we would be on Mars by now. I remember as a kid in the 80s the boomer docents at the museum of science and industry telling me we would have colonies on the moon by 2000. And we probably would have if we didn't have an neverending handout to thirdworld people who have literally sucked the lifeblood out of the United States with their foreign invasion. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments... load 1 more comments... actlikewewon 9 points 6 days ago Some call that popcorn time. permalink parent award report block reply maltese-poodle 3 points 6 days ago It's a bunch of retarded leftist white women who did it just to \"look cool\" - it's all over Tiktok the level of mental retardation of these faggots. permalink parent award report block reply Kingofthehill11 4 points 6 days ago After Covid I don't think they will learn.

Women are easily led by their emotions, and social media is the perfect tool to manipulate women into believing anything, like killing her own baby is a great idea, empowering, and makes her a good person. Voting for a commie muslim is a great idea, or else you're a racist who wants poor people to starve to death. See how that works? It works on women very effectively and most don't even realize it decade after decade, generation after generation. permalink award report block reply _Sully_ 13 points 6 days ago They'd change their vote the instant it isn't convenient for them too.

Student council this, that or the other thing carries no real responsibility.  The teachers and the admin run the school.  But the titles have social value for some unknown reason.  And supposedly indicate to people who see it on a resume or college application some level of responsibility and maturity.  When it doesn't indicate shit.  Except maybe ambition and a propensity for performative bullshit. The whole process is supposed to teach kids about governments and elections but it does the opposite.  Every one learns about titles and that granting a title to someone marks them as a better.  So it isn't about giving a job to someone who can do it.  It's about selecting a person to be anointed as a better.  And the campaign process is about deciding who to give this status and privilege to.  Who 'deserves' to be the holder of a title that comes with advantages.  Who has 'earned' it. And who gives a shit if the students choose to grant 'knighthood' to a village idiot.  The administrators run the school anyway.  Enter the deep state bureaucracy and everyone having been conditioned to accept it while voting for a series of golden child dipshits running for student council bullshit.

It is inconceivable to them that there once existed a generation of White men who could achieve the impossible.

Nation, country, and race are \"problematic\", God is dead, and culture is nothing but types of food or some quaint dance. Everyone is now a part of the this new culture, a culture of consumption, with the values of a Walmart, your life measured in iphone iterations and subscription services. The foreigners who will come to be the majority in the country in 10 years won't care, and the White children we've left behind won't know any better, or more likely, have been programmed to believe that Whites never had a homeland, never deserved one of their own, where it was just them. The foreigners have always been with you, White man, and how dare you not seek their tribal wisdom in every aspect of your society? They will be told they are our betters, and always have been. It will take generations of suffering before White people feel the call of the blood and realize they are the masters of this world.

You can see the lander, the rover, and it's tracks from low orbit. https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-all-six-apollo-moon-landing-sites/ The reason nobody believes (and it's going to get worse, like Planet of the Apes), is because it is such a monumental accomplishment that in today's world of \"supply chain issues\", 50% White population, and other retarded fuckery, it seems impossible. Even back then, blacks protested against it because they wanted that money spent on gibs, not human achievement of the grandest order. The moon was worshiped as a goddess by tribes people who now control our culture, and White men put a flag on it. If White nations had stayed White, we would be on Mars by now.
