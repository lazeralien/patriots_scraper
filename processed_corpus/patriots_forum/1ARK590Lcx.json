If the census and exit polls are to be believed, NYC is composed of roughly 60% foreign-born residents and many of whom have arrived in just the past few years. These new voters did not forget 9/11. Rather, they do not care about 9/11; they did not even live through 9/11. \"Some people did something.\" permalink parent award report block reply ThePatriotGames2016 1 points 4 days ago no. 911 was the catalyst and intentional and depended on 90s tolerance bullshit and (they) the government knows it and depended on it to work that way. they play the long game, and we can't sit through a fucking 20 minute tv show that they feed us for brain rot. permalink parent award report block reply Quiznos585 9 points 4 days ago He needs to be arrested.

Why can't a muslim be mayor of NYC? If a muslim can be a manager of a Walmart then why can't he be mayor? He won by merit, Trump's favorite thing. White people have lost the United States, and when you're a White minority in 10 years, it's just going to get worse. Elect 100 Trumps. It doesn't matter. The only way this country is saved is by deporting 100 million foreigners, which is basically impossible without the military, which will never be used. You also assume that they will go willingly. Why would they? There are 100 million of them, and plenty of miltary aged males. It's over. You are going to watch the United States disappear and there isn't a God damn thing you can do about it. Best thing, is it's all going to happen legally , and the great laws of the country and muh constitution and le democracy will prevent you from doing anything. You've lost before you even knew you were fighting. You were all tricked into \"equality\" and not being \"racist\". Now you don't have a country. They've already won. permalink parent award report block reply Tellman125 1 points 3 days ago Even posting that type of lengthy comment, where genuinely defeatist/doomist or just reverse-psychological (\"You're all impotent, we've already lost the country, nothing we do matters, it's over\") shows that you actually still believe in being political active and making a difference; you shows more concern and faith in your and OUR power through that act of speaking out (in writing, on social media) than what was shown by millions of New York City adults who choose not to vote in the mayoral election, despite having a week and half to do so. In the most recently presidential election, the conservative Republican won, and in the most recent Senate and House elections, a Republican majority prevailed. \"One shit city does not a shit country make.\" There are other urban shithole cities we have: combine Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles (where the crime has been affected fancy parts of WEST LA for years now, as I know from visiting there), and a big part of Chicago - that combined population (.781K + 635K + 3.8M + 2.7M = 7.9M) not far from that of NYC (8.4M), and THOSE 4 horrendous cities don't represent most of our country. If Kamala were president right now, I'd have a different view, but Biden only won because of the cheating, as Trump proved when he roared back into office by rightfully winning all 6 of the states that Biden stole. And speaking of elections, the fact that the NYC race had 3 candidates was something that split the vote in Scamdummy's favor--he won with 50.4% while the other two had to spend time fighting each other as well as fighting him. Conversely, in the 2021 Democrat primary, it was 4 stridently woke primary candidates who split the vote in favor of the non-woke candidate, Eric Adams, who only ever talked about law and order and didn't pander to wokeness; he won, absurdly, with 30.7% of the vote: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_New_York_City_Democratic_mayoral_primary permalink parent award report block reply Anyone 8 points 4 days ago Americans are stupid... specially voting for moslem communists... you can't get any more stupider... permalink award report block reply FirstBorn 7 points 4 days ago Peeps should buy as many billboard spaces as possible in NYC and have it read:\n\"Allah Is Satan!\"\nand,\n\"Jesus Saves\"\nSee how long it takes for this POS to take it down.

They are a monotheistic Abrahamic based system - now true it's 85% political and basicly picked and chose from Judaism and Christianity and added nothing new except leaned in on violence and such. permalink award report block reply ApprenticeParty 2 points 3 days ago The foundation of the religion is Arab paganism. They spackled over with some Unitarian Christian heresies and called it monotheistic and abrahamic, but it\u2019s absolutely pagan at its root. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 1 points 3 days ago [Long pause, while looking down. Sighs* looks up] I have studied theology in actual universities and have lived and worked in the middle east north Africa (mena) region; i have studied the Quran the Hadiths all the Sunnah i have also studied archeology of the region and how various religions impacted cultures in different but significant ways. I've written several books on Islam specifically and have actually been to Mecca and all of the holy sites. I have poured over linguistic differences between arcaic Arabic and modern  Arabic; three types of Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew and compared obscure letters and passages that even indirectly discuss Islam Christianity or Mithras or Zoroastrians and more. And....  Islam is not based on Arab paganism. I understand you think that's an \"own\" and you are dunking on them but it's just embarrassingly incorrect.  Islam has traces and bits of Arab paganism just as Christianity has echoes of European paganism, but to say it is a foundation is silly. permalink parent award report block reply ApprenticeParty 2 points 3 days ago Please link to your books, I\u2019d love to read them. I\u2019d hardly call one of the 5 pillars of the religion \u201cechos\u201d. You\u2019ve personally been a historically pagan site, where Muslims partake in pagan rituals and worship one of the gods of the Arabian pantheon - Islamic history shows \u201cAllah\u201d as a pagan god, Muhammad\u2019s father was named \u201cslave of Allah\u201d and Muhammad\u2019s father died 4 years before Muhammad was born, let alone before any revelation. The pagan daughters of Allah are included in the religion. Any claims that this is not pagan is simply due to illegality of investigating such claims and the destruction of evidence starting in the 6th century when the other kabbas of different Arabian areas were destroyed. Borrowing stories from the infancy gospel and other gnostic works and from the Talmud ( especially the Talmud) doesn\u2019t make a religion Abrahamic. If that were to be the case, true satanism worshipping Lucifer would be abrahamic as well. I\u2019m presuming you would dispute that. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 1 points 3 days ago It's kind of like human genetic relationships at some point there may be some connection but I would say all religions including Christianity and perhaps more than most are \"tainted\" with paganism. But we have to define foundations Yes Arab pagans went to Mecca long before Islam and they new religion adopted customs of the past ones, but foundational no. Ancient Hebrews or the people.of them had many gods though most Christians will deny this but facts are stubborn things. Jewish folklore still refers to yhwh's wife as the comforter who would drape her cloak over the children of earth to shield them from \"arrows or spears\" thrown in rage. However socio-emotional necessity caused early jews to ditch much of this as their was too much overlap with neighbor's goddesses. In facts you can still see how \"harlot\" is in one example translated from a word that mean \"priestess\".  There are many other examples A solar God born shortly after the winter solstice (dec 25th ish) Had 12 followers Wandered around healing people. Known as the good Shepard and the lamb The list is endless. Jesus became popular because it was a story they were familiar with. Romans particularly liked mithras and fixated on blood sacrifice for atonement of sins, and it was not Jesus that fixated on \"the blood the blood  the blood.... washing over you...\" that was mithras and Paul and where did he come? Tarsus and what was Tarsus? Chief Capitol of mithras worship, naturally he was influenced  - this man who never walked with Jesus during his ministry and whose message has a different feel, but he wrote 2/3rds of the new testament- this man who claims to have walked with jesus' ghost alone with no witnesses....   im just sayin  if you want to go down the road of how religions merge and shift and combine you might not like what you find. Islam - which i loathe BTW-   is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion that explicitly builds on Judaism and Christianity as prior revelations from the same God (Allah). Its core theology\u2014strict monotheism (tawhid), prophethood, angels, scriptures, and judgment\u2014is directly derived from and reframes the Torah and Gospel. The Qur\u2019an positions Muhammad as the final prophet in the same line as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. While pre-Islamic Arab pagan practices (e.g., the Kaaba, pilgrimage rituals) were retained and repurposed, they were stripped of polytheism and subordinated to monotheistic worship. These are cultural forms, not foundational doctrines. The theological and legal foundation of Islam rests on Jewish and Christian scriptures (as understood and corrected by the Qur\u2019an), not paganism. As for my books I will not dox myself as my feelings on Islam specifically are  tremendously dangerous. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

I'm skeptical, but other people claim it's working. This is why Muslims live in enclaves where they are close to 100% of the population.  That enables them to control and spy on people all the time, making sure they don't stray, killing them if necessary.  If there's a 100% Muslim enclave, it's a de facto Sharia Law zone, because no Muslim will report anything to the police.  You can honor kill your daughter for doubting Islam, bury the body, nobody calls the cops, nobody gets prosecuted, nobody will ever know. permalink parent award report block reply\nTellman125 1 points 3 days ago Whose kids?

They are a monotheistic Abrahamic based system - now true it's 85% political and basicly picked and chose from Judaism and Christianity and added nothing new except leaned in on violence and such. permalink award report block reply ApprenticeParty 2 points 3 days ago The foundation of the religion is Arab paganism. They spackled over with some Unitarian Christian heresies and called it monotheistic and abrahamic, but it\u2019s absolutely pagan at its root. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 1 points 3 days ago [Long pause, while looking down. Sighs* looks up] I have studied theology in actual universities and have lived and worked in the middle east north Africa (mena) region; i have studied the Quran the Hadiths all the Sunnah i have also studied archeology of the region and how various religions impacted cultures in different but significant ways. I've written several books on Islam specifically and have actually been to Mecca and all of the holy sites. I have poured over linguistic differences between arcaic Arabic and modern  Arabic; three types of Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew and compared obscure letters and passages that even indirectly discuss Islam Christianity or Mithras or Zoroastrians and more. And....  Islam is not based on Arab paganism. I understand you think that's an \"own\" and you are dunking on them but it's just embarrassingly incorrect.  Islam has traces and bits of Arab paganism just as Christianity has echoes of European paganism, but to say it is a foundation is silly. permalink parent award report block reply ApprenticeParty 2 points 3 days ago Please link to your books, I\u2019d love to read them. I\u2019d hardly call one of the 5 pillars of the religion \u201cechos\u201d. You\u2019ve personally been a historically pagan site, where Muslims partake in pagan rituals and worship one of the gods of the Arabian pantheon - Islamic history shows \u201cAllah\u201d as a pagan god, Muhammad\u2019s father was named \u201cslave of Allah\u201d and Muhammad\u2019s father died 4 years before Muhammad was born, let alone before any revelation. The pagan daughters of Allah are included in the religion. Any claims that this is not pagan is simply due to illegality of investigating such claims and the destruction of evidence starting in the 6th century when the other kabbas of different Arabian areas were destroyed. Borrowing stories from the infancy gospel and other gnostic works and from the Talmud ( especially the Talmud) doesn\u2019t make a religion Abrahamic. If that were to be the case, true satanism worshipping Lucifer would be abrahamic as well. I\u2019m presuming you would dispute that. permalink parent award report block reply MAGALADON9 1 points 3 days ago It's kind of like human genetic relationships at some point there may be some connection but I would say all religions including Christianity and perhaps more than most are \"tainted\" with paganism. But we have to define foundations Yes Arab pagans went to Mecca long before Islam and they new religion adopted customs of the past ones, but foundational no. Ancient Hebrews or the people.of them had many gods though most Christians will deny this but facts are stubborn things. Jewish folklore still refers to yhwh's wife as the comforter who would drape her cloak over the children of earth to shield them from \"arrows or spears\" thrown in rage. However socio-emotional necessity caused early jews to ditch much of this as their was too much overlap with neighbor's goddesses. In facts you can still see how \"harlot\" is in one example translated from a word that mean \"priestess\".  There are many other examples A solar God born shortly after the winter solstice (dec 25th ish) Had 12 followers Wandered around healing people. Known as the good Shepard and the lamb The list is endless. Jesus became popular because it was a story they were familiar with. Romans particularly liked mithras and fixated on blood sacrifice for atonement of sins, and it was not Jesus that fixated on \"the blood the blood  the blood.... washing over you...\" that was mithras and Paul and where did he come? Tarsus and what was Tarsus? Chief Capitol of mithras worship, naturally he was influenced  - this man who never walked with Jesus during his ministry and whose message has a different feel, but he wrote 2/3rds of the new testament- this man who claims to have walked with jesus' ghost alone with no witnesses....   im just sayin  if you want to go down the road of how religions merge and shift and combine you might not like what you find. Islam - which i loathe BTW-   is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion that explicitly builds on Judaism and Christianity as prior revelations from the same God (Allah). Its core theology\u2014strict monotheism (tawhid), prophethood, angels, scriptures, and judgment\u2014is directly derived from and reframes the Torah and Gospel. The Qur\u2019an positions Muhammad as the final prophet in the same line as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. While pre-Islamic Arab pagan practices (e.g., the Kaaba, pilgrimage rituals) were retained and repurposed, they were stripped of polytheism and subordinated to monotheistic worship. These are cultural forms, not foundational doctrines. The theological and legal foundation of Islam rests on Jewish and Christian scriptures (as understood and corrected by the Qur\u2019an), not paganism. As for my books I will not dox myself as my feelings on Islam specifically are  tremendously dangerous. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...\nApprenticeParty 2 points 3 days ago The foundation of the religion is Arab paganism.
