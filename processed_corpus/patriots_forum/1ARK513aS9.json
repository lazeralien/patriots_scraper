You approved syping on the Senate?  NOW we will do something. Congress is full of cucks. permalink parent award report block reply MAGARondonmonson 5 points 6 days ago At the time, they had people convinced that Russia was pro Trump and they were in league, so the phone taps must be legal. Now through a larger pattern of events they can see this judge (many are just like him) is just a rogue liberal  bandit of a politician in a robe permalink parent award report block reply USDMaga 5 points 6 days ago Comey, who tapped Trump, was the one that made up the Russia hoax.  He knew it was fake when he filed the FISA warrant. Senate said NOTHING. Congress are cucks permalink parent award report block reply MAGARondonmonson 2 points 6 days ago They hid all that info, only the Gang of 8 knew, Burr & Paul Ryan knew, Rubio was not privy to most of this info. Pelosi and Schumer were as was McConnel. permalink parent award report block reply RStroud 3 points 6 days ago It is obvious that there is effectively a Praetorian Guard that attempts to run DC from behind the scenes and parallel to electoral politics.  There are undoubtedly fiefdoms and factions within that group, foreign alliances, skirmishes and coups.  They're at the edges of political hit jobs both literal and metaphorical:  JFK, COINTELPRO, Watergate, Russiagate, Epstein type stuff is the tip of the iceberg. They're not going to be called to account in their own system and you can't vote them out.  The biggest difference between the US and say Russia or China is that our revolutionary mythos was based on different values and we still believe in our veneer of a democratic republic.  The current cracks mostly come from no longer reinforcing and glorifying that origin mythos, but criticizing it while promoting and idolizing the \"oppressed\" and \"scientific\" management.  We're at the point in the cultural revolution where \"America for Americans\" or \"America First\" is controversial because so many people don't see themselves as American, and associate America with backwards (white) provincial people. permalink parent award report block reply friedchicken 10 points 6 days ago Dickless cunts permalink parent award report block reply OldZilla 2 points 6 days ago Oxy morons you say? permalink parent award report block reply SocraticMethod1 4 points 6 days ago Maybe, maybe not as THEY were targeted by this.

The Rep Senators admit there won\u2019t be enough votes to convict and remove him (even if Murkowski and Collins went along, which seems unlikely).  This is just an effort to expose more behind the scenes activity, much of which we already suspect. permalink parent award report block reply load 17 more comments...

This is a criminal act.  It should be handled by the criminal justice system, not the political system. permalink parent award report block reply Snek_Plissken -4 points 6 days ago Judges have qualified immunity.

We can via a trial prove he is guilty easily. If they keep him in, then there is a way to defund them. permalink parent award report block reply Bythrfruitsyknow 2 points 6 days ago Yes, because having simple majority impeachment of judges and supreme court justices is a good idea.  Having seen the left's recent commentary do you think Justice Thomas or Justice  Kavanaugh would be still seated? Shouldn't you be out there solving unsolved crimes, genius? permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -5 points 6 days ago 2/3 Senate vote needed. But faggots here don't want to criticize the \"based Founding Fathers\" who put that in the Constitution. I will start taking people seriously when they start calling out the Constitutional Convention as much as they do when they bitch about Trump. If Trump is worthy of getting blamed then their precious \"based Founding Fathers\" really need to get assblasted for the impeachment threshold and cockblocking Trump from doing much in domestic policy like they give the presidents dictatorial power with regards to foreign policy and many other problems with the Constitution. The Constitution's \"muh based states' rights\" is why states are able to rig elections and give illegal aliens driver's licenses. permalink parent award report block reply NonbinaryPotatohead -3 points 6 days ago MAGA doesn't want to play the game, they are too busy getting compromised in sex scandals on tape in foreign lands. They could win if they gave a shit but clearly all they care about is the status quo. Feels just like the W. Bush era right now. permalink parent award report block reply Sparks1017 18 points 6 days ago But would still require 2/3 rds of Senate? Am I right about that? I think if he were just hanged, that would work permalink award report block reply dataonly 8 points 6 days ago Might find a sympathetic ear on this particular subject. Many of the old Senators have loyalty to the Senate.  Even rational Dems are thinking what if an R leaning judge seized my phone records.  Because, they know what would be found. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 13 points 6 days ago There won't ever be enough Democrats to go along with this because even the RINOs want Trump obstructed whenever possible permalink parent award report block reply dataonly 6 points 6 days ago You may be right, but this is a different sort of issue.  This is a Judge going after members of the Senate.  That can work both ways. I could see enough Dems wanting to send a message on this subject to the judiciary. But again, you may be right. permalink parent award report block reply current_horror 4 points 6 days ago Nope. Democrats rely on their installed kings in black robes to unilaterally rule over the country. Dems will never check their own power. permalink parent award report block reply Kraken_V_Algorithm 2 points 6 days ago Most of them know who the targets are and can count on not being one if they vote the right way. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 1 points 6 days ago In a just world, you would be correct. But knowing the Uniparty all the insane judicial activism magically goes away once the right people are back in control permalink parent award report block reply Sgt_Hulka 4 points 6 days ago The day a republican judge does this will be the day snow falls in hell.

It's just for show. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -5 points 6 days ago Retards here don't want to talk about 2/3 Senate because that means they will have to criticize the Founding Fathers and they aren't allowed to criticize about \"much based Constitution\" permalink parent award report block reply dataonly 3 points 6 days ago The Founding Fathers intentionally made \"removal after impeachment\" a necessarily high bar to reduce the political nature of the process itself. i.e. It would be possible to garner a slim majority and vote as a block.  But requiring 2/3 all but eliminates that possibility. permalink parent award report block reply ragnarokrobo 2 points 6 days ago Same as when everyone was screaming about impeaching Biden like it'd ever get through the senate. permalink parent award report block reply Ryunnsun 9 points 6 days ago Let's impeach the rest of the judges who approved surveillance of  Americans for political points. permalink award report block reply elc0 1 points 6 days ago Lol. permalink parent award report block reply Liberty49220 7 points 6 days ago If a Republican congressman represents your district,  it only takes a few minutes to contact them to support this. permalink award report block reply Sparks1017 4 points 6 days ago Me and my Rep are on a first name basis, he's cool and a Patriot permalink parent award report block reply MissingTrump 6 points 6 days ago Trial and punishment.

They don't care about the people permalink award report block reply Lurker404 2 points 6 days ago Don't they need 2/3 of the votes for an impeachment? That means they need Dem votes. They'd never vote with Reps unless they are personally affected. permalink parent award report block reply DCYR66 4 points 6 days ago He won\u2019t. Our DOJ all talk no action. permalink award report block reply IForgotToAddAnEmail 4 points 6 days ago I'm sure they plan a lot of things. permalink award report block reply Double_D 3 points 6 days ago They wouldn\u2019t impeach him for overseeing a multitude of illegal activity on the FISA court, including spying on the Trump campaign, wouldn\u2019t impeach him over  his handling of the Klinesmith case or any of these more recent overreaches but, as soon as it\u2019s revealed he fucked with them , he has to go. The vast majority of the GOP are self interested faggots permalink award report block reply Lurker404 1 points 6 days ago That's because they need some Dem votes for an impeachment AFAIK. permalink parent award report block reply Double_D 1 points 6 days ago Right, but why no calls for impeachment for all the other illegal activity? Do they really think they\u2019re more likely to get 2/3 of the senate now than they were before? permalink parent award report block reply Lurker404 1 points 6 days ago Because all the other shit only affected Trump. They'd sooner give him a medal for that than vote with Republicans. This one affects senators. They might feel more inclined to vote in their own interest but I doubt it. permalink parent award report block reply Double_D 1 points 6 days ago One, Boasberg\u2019s transgressions on the FISA court go way beyond Trump. While he was on the court, it was discovered that the FBI was illegally searching the NSA database for thousands of redacted individuals\u2019 communications and giving the information to redacted contractors, going back to at least 2010. He did absolutely nothing about it. Two, Senate GOP leadership and Trump aren\u2019t on the same team. Their overall interests are much more aligned with Dem leadership than with Trump\u2019s. Their ultimate goal is to protect a system that enriches themselves and the billionaires who pay for their campaigns. permalink parent award report block reply Snek_Plissken -6 points 6 days ago I don\u2019t even know about that. This is Boarsheadburger. Him and his family are all up in the NGO scheme. You don\u2019t get all that usaids without connections. He is their dog on a leash and he is immune from legal harm.  Anyone who believes he acted independently as an idiot. They absolutely colluded and orchestrated several judges and state attorneys to make a kabuki theatre of the law. permalink parent award report block reply 16BeatsAOne 3 points 6 days ago Judge Beryl Howell has to be next on the Impeachment List. permalink award report block reply YearninNation 3 points 6 days ago Pam Bondi will be the reason Trump's second term will be a spectacular failure that gives vote riggers all the power they need to end the American experiment. permalink award report block reply RudeFrog 3 points 6 days ago Republicans are not going to do anything but talk. They will bullshit their way into losing the midterm like always. Because they are America last losers. Stop being played by them. permalink award report block reply patrioticwinning3 3 points 6 days ago Believe it when I see it... permalink award report block reply JoeBidensDementia1 2 points 6 days ago They ain't planning on doing shit permalink award report block reply Seldom_Seen_Kid 2 points 6 days ago Impeachment means nothing\u2026jail his ass!! permalink award report block reply FlyCatcher94 2 points 6 days ago NOW they act since it\u2019s their shit being fuxked with. Assholes permalink award report block reply bonejack 2 points 6 days ago 'Member when the gop had all that evidence against Biden and his family, just before the midterms saying stuff like \"we caught'em, it's all a shell game.\" or \"this president is the most corrupt president ever. We will impeach him, right after the midterms.\" Then absolutely nothing happened. I 'member. permalink award report block reply cbonez416 2 points 6 days ago This is something I believe when I see. Because all I've seen is nothing but harsh words from the GOP and the Republican party. These people don't have any balls. They don't have any touch on reality and they have absolutely zero gauge on the culture. permalink award report block reply A_Colostomy_Bag 2 points 6 days ago They should be impeaching dozens of judges who are conspiring against Trump and the country. permalink award report block reply Trumpwon306 2 points 6 days ago Nothing will come of this. Ignore this. Shame any retard who even shares this 'news' The only practical and half-feasable solution is to defund and dismantle the circuit courts and then reestablish them, nominating strict traditionalists. Anything else is just a ploy. permalink award report block reply pookiee68 2 points 6 days ago NO WAY the RINO losers who make up the majority of Republicans do ANYTHING, the Democrats who own them won't allow it. permalink award report block reply Fangerang 2 points 6 days ago Need more doing and less talking, planning, and strongly worded letters. permalink award report block reply Surgeon 2 points 6 days ago They'll promote him . The SWAMP never prosecutes the deep stater commie traitors .  He'll be promoted to Chief Judge at Supreme court next . Why doesn't congress enact Trumps EO's instead of wasting taxpayer funds on this shit ? MAGA voted for change / DRAIN THE SWAMP permalink award report block reply mass55th 2 points 6 days ago Don't fucking talk about it...just do it!! permalink award report block reply AllTheWayTrump 2 points 6 days ago So they'll  do something when their rights are abused, but when it's Trumps or ordinary Americans they couldn't give 2 fucks. permalink award report block reply thp2034 2 points 6 days ago Not until it happened to them. They have had this same power to impeach & remove a judge since day one. Why didn't any of them step up and file impeachment papers on any of the rouge district court judges that came after the President? It's not to late, anyone of them can still do it...why aren't they? permalink award report block reply Forty_Five 2 points 6 days ago \"plan to\" Which means literally nothing. In fact it's evidence against them actually doing anything. permalink award report block reply SurveilThis 2 points 6 days ago Typical shit. Senators never do a single thing until it happens to them directly. Spy on your party\u2019s sitting President? Here\u2019s a strongly worded letter. Spy on my Senate accounts? Here\u2019s two strongly worded letters. permalink award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 1 points 6 days ago The impeachment is a scam. Republicans know it won't remove him because it won't pass the Senate. We need the Republican majority in Congress to abolish the judge's court and re-institute it with a new judicial opening, via passing a new law. This will remove him from his position with a simple majority vote in Congress. No impeachment is required. permalink award report block reply DoMe22 1 points 6 days ago Yeah, this ain't happening. Trump is the only useful republican. permalink award report block reply BoughtByBloomberg2 1 points 6 days ago Plan to strongly consider discussion the options of potentially doing something. permalink award report block reply Rakkasan91b 1 points 6 days ago I love that these losers can't be bothered to ever even go through the motions of impeaching any of these judges who have been blatantly corrupt, usurping power, or making blatantly political decisions that have affected hundreds of thousands of people for years.  Yet, now that one of the judges did something that affects some of them they are now so suddenly eager to impeach someone. permalink award report block reply Tacitus1963 1 points 6 days ago The Republicans will do jack schitt as they always do especially when it's PDJT who is in office.\nThey are beyond useless. permalink award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 1 points 6 days ago Fuck impeaching him, arrest the faggot. permalink award report block reply SilentSniper 1 points 6 days ago Do it already you worthless spineless fucks.
