On a Saturday night the place is always packed and getting a machine is usually a bit of a wait. The crowd is almost always 80% black 10% Hispanic 5% white and 5% Asian by about 11pm early evening is mostly white. Last night however it was only about 10% black if even that. The crowd was minimal maybe at 10% capacity and it was more even between white and Hispanic. I was sitting with my Brother while the girls were off gambling and it hit me, was this because of food stamps? Even if it were a slow night there would be a lot more people in the casino.  I am starting to think that welfare is holding up a lot of luxury industries.
