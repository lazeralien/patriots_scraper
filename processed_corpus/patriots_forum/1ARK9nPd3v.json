Basically you graduate at 16. The school is hard. You have 4 options - drop out, graduate, community college, university. You were generally considered a failure if you didn't do the community college. permalink award report block reply tradcathbugman 2 points 3 hours ago That sounds interesting, but the problem isn't with the structure of our education system, it's that nobody involved cares.  The administrators, teachers, parents, students, all are willing to accept this situation over the alternative, which is working hard and solving problems to meet goals.  Our system works when people care, I bet the soviet system worked when people cared, I bet a mandatory day a week at the library would work better than what we have now if people cared. permalink parent award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty OP 1 points 3 hours ago Bulldozer permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 3 hours ago The Soviet system is based on people not caring.

A week into the school year I required my students to purchase a few books for the school year- four to be exact. One non-fiction, history book per marking period and a paper based off of it. II teach USH Honors for Juniors. I gave them a list of one of three books to choose from per quarter. Well I got pulled into my Assistant Principal\u2019s Office on a Friday and was told I couldn\u2019t do that. I couldn\u2019t force students or families to buy any books and said it was \u201creckless\u201d for me to not come and ask permission first. As a result he had a \u201cwritten reprimand\u201d and \u201cwarning\u201d for me to sign. I quit on the spot. Not before teeing off on this guy and then heading to my principal\u2019s office to let him know. They tried backtracking but I packed my room and was out of there. I sent a real nice blast email to parents and students too as soon as I got home before they could deactivate my district email explaining everything. I even CC\u2019d my previous year\u2019s families whose kids I taught a full year. 16-17 year old kids that can\u2019t read, they can\u2019t write, they can\u2019t put a sentence together, they can\u2019t think critically. They\u2019re the shits at math which I\u2019ve also taught and don\u2019t know lick of other core subjects. Their lazy dumbasses continuously try cheating on assignments with AI which wasted hours of my time documenting and writing kids up despite warning after warning. The real bozo seniors with the 1.6 GPA in April are forced through by administration by pressuring senior teachers. And starting this year the lowest grade we were allowed to give students was a 50%. Meaning they could do nothing and still get half credit. There\u2019s an old saying that you get what you pay for. You want free \u201cpublic education\u201d this is what you get. Make some sacrifices and pay extra for homeschooling. Plenty of private homeschooling networks amongst parents and plenty of people like me who are experienced teachers that can be hired to help teach children the way they deserve to be taught. Too many misconceptions that you need a stay at home parent while this is not the case. I advise anyone with children to consider, as I even the parochial and private schools are losing it. permalink award report block reply BenDoverAssho 1 points 2 hours ago I've heard of hybrid types of homeschooling where parents form \" pods\" and pool resources to hire tutors for a few courses like math or science, and then the parents will pitch in to teach other courses like English or history. It seems to be a better way than going solo. Something else no one mentions is the violence in public schools. Especially,  from blacks. Public schools just seem like total waste these days. permalink parent award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty OP 1 points 3 hours ago Bulldozer. permalink parent award report block reply 26magarat 2 points 3 hours ago Maybe schools like Harvard can offer remedial writing classes in addition to algebra.

Depressed, tiny school, bad kids etc. I was in special ED classes early on for kids having trouble reading. I had to go to \u201cthe trailer\u201d every morning. Eventually I improved and was kept in those classes to tutor other kids. When we were all tested in the 5th grade I had a reading comprehension level of a 12th grader. This could be done with so many kids if the families and teachers cared at all. I can\u2019t understand how this even happens. Maybe it is genetic, who knows. permalink award report block reply FearGodTheAlmighty OP 1 points 3 hours ago Bulldozer permalink parent award report block reply MakinBacon 2 points 3 hours ago Grandkids school is in a fairly low income town.....they have 3 vice principals....wtf?

A week into the school year I required my students to purchase a few books for the school year- four to be exact. One non-fiction, history book per marking period and a paper based off of it. II teach USH Honors for Juniors. I gave them a list of one of three books to choose from per quarter. Well I got pulled into my Assistant Principal\u2019s Office on a Friday and was told I couldn\u2019t do that. I couldn\u2019t force students or families to buy any books and said it was \u201creckless\u201d for me to not come and ask permission first. As a result he had a \u201cwritten reprimand\u201d and \u201cwarning\u201d for me to sign. I quit on the spot. Not before teeing off on this guy and then heading to my principal\u2019s office to let him know. They tried backtracking but I packed my room and was out of there. I sent a real nice blast email to parents and students too as soon as I got home before they could deactivate my district email explaining everything. I even CC\u2019d my previous year\u2019s families whose kids I taught a full year. 16-17 year old kids that can\u2019t read, they can\u2019t write, they can\u2019t put a sentence together, they can\u2019t think critically. They\u2019re the shits at math which I\u2019ve also taught and don\u2019t know lick of other core subjects. Their lazy dumbasses continuously try cheating on assignments with AI which wasted hours of my time documenting and writing kids up despite warning after warning. The real bozo seniors with the 1.6 GPA in April are forced through by administration by pressuring senior teachers. And starting this year the lowest grade we were allowed to give students was a 50%. Meaning they could do nothing and still get half credit. There\u2019s an old saying that you get what you pay for. You want free \u201cpublic education\u201d this is what you get. Make some sacrifices and pay extra for homeschooling. Plenty of private homeschooling networks amongst parents and plenty of people like me who are experienced teachers that can be hired to help teach children the way they deserve to be taught. Too many misconceptions that you need a stay at home parent while this is not the case. I advise anyone with children to consider, as I even the parochial and private schools are losing it. permalink award report block reply BenDoverAssho 1 points 2 hours ago I've heard of hybrid types of homeschooling where parents form \" pods\" and pool resources to hire tutors for a few courses like math or science, and then the parents will pitch in to teach other courses like English or history.
