Additionally, declaring \"MAGA dead\" is just the shills trying to amplify and sow disharmony. MAGA as a movement isn't dead, we just need to continue to push back in areas where disagreements arises. Almost as if that's what the representative form of government requires, ideas and feedback.

I know, I know..... he could have spelled it out better but hearing him talk about the trillions of dollars in investments pouring into our country what like $20 trillion by the end of the year. I've been wondering  myself how the hell are we going to fill all the high tech positions coming. Surely not with a whole generation of entitled children that don't want to work. Believe me I want as little H1B's as possible, if any, but I'm sure they've been crunching the numbers and they need 2+2 to equal 4 and not 5 to make the coming high tech industrial boom not fail before it's even off the ground. Without more information I'm in the same boat as most people, No H1B's but I also want America to be at the fore front of the next high tech industrial revolution regardless. The next few years could make or break this Country. permalink parent award report block reply CaptainCuomo 3 points 4 hours ago \"$20 Trillion by the end of the year\". That's a crazy number. The US GDP has been above $20 Trillion every year-- since 2017.  So that's not some new record being broken. There is NOT another $20 Trillion in foreign investments arriving by the end of the year. Nor is there $20 Trillion in tariffs being collected-- not even close. So... no... there is not $20 Trillion dollars of Demand pouring into US high-tech labor markets/ with no American workers to fill those spots. \"Stupid Bitch!!!\" You want her to be like the Dem FAKE NEWS-- and not ask our President the real, obvious questions on MAGA voters' minds?! I have a couple of \"white pill\" beliefs about Trump & the economy-- which pretty-much bail him out of trouble (in my mind) on nearly-any occasion:   1.) Whenever Trump makes an unconventional move, it-- by definition-- defies conventional opinion.  So it's super-easy to complain, on conventional grounds.  But conventional thinking is the wrong way to judge unconventional actions.   2.)  US economic policy has been so mindlessly conventional-- for So Long!-- that ANY move away from the Same Old Shit-- will have at-least a momentary \"Change Dividend\".     For example, taking the flippers off your feet & using them to paddle with your hands is-- in general-- a bad idea.  EXCEPT, if you've been using only your legs to swim 50 miles... then, yeah, your legs are probably exhausted & your arms Will Be better (temporarily).    That applies to things like Tariffs.   I think they're good.  I may be wrong.  But the US has been SO anti-tariff... for So Long... that switching to tariffs provides Short Term relief.  EVEN IF tariffs are (perhaps) bad policy In The Long Run. That said--  it's not good-- when Trump's pronouncements and policies don't clearly make sense On Their Own...   causing me to have to dip into my bottle of White Pills. permalink parent award report block reply Faintlight 4 points 9 hours ago Too much support for Bibi. permalink parent award report block reply RyanKeyOh 2 points 9 hours ago H1B permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments...

You have energy unleashed, massive amounts of investment for producing all kind of things on our shores, RFK taking an axe to the bad medical system, and far more control over the flow of people than we have had in a long time - all examples of things that can take many years to fully produce results. The seeds have all been planted for these things and more, but many Americans are hurting in the immediate right now, and that cannot be ignored. Not just Trump, but Republicans as a whole have to come up with better short term measures to buy time. That includes the Tuckers and Mark Levin's of the world - everyone needs to stop wasting their time on bullshit and think of real solutions. With regards to the H1B topic,  it is very complicated and I don't think it is as simple as Trump thinks Americans are too stupid. I can get into the weeds, but my view is that he has a relaxed attitude towards it largely because it's one of the few ways he can brute force prices down in some areas. It's not something that matters long term because a ton of those jobs will get replaced by ai anyway. permalink parent award report block reply Apersonofinterest 11 points 10 hours ago As Bannon likes to say, they aren\u2019t just going to give up and hand us the keys.

I know, I know..... he could have spelled it out better but hearing him talk about the trillions of dollars in investments pouring into our country what like $20 trillion by the end of the year. I've been wondering  myself how the hell are we going to fill all the high tech positions coming. Surely not with a whole generation of entitled children that don't want to work. Believe me I want as little H1B's as possible, if any, but I'm sure they've been crunching the numbers and they need 2+2 to equal 4 and not 5 to make the coming high tech industrial boom not fail before it's even off the ground. Without more information I'm in the same boat as most people, No H1B's but I also want America to be at the fore front of the next high tech industrial revolution regardless. The next few years could make or break this Country. permalink parent award report block reply CaptainCuomo 3 points 4 hours ago \"$20 Trillion by the end of the year\". That's a crazy number. The US GDP has been above $20 Trillion every year-- since 2017.  So that's not some new record being broken. There is NOT another $20 Trillion in foreign investments arriving by the end of the year. Nor is there $20 Trillion in tariffs being collected-- not even close. So... no... there is not $20 Trillion dollars of Demand pouring into US high-tech labor markets/ with no American workers to fill those spots. \"Stupid Bitch!!!\" You want her to be like the Dem FAKE NEWS-- and not ask our President the real, obvious questions on MAGA voters' minds?! I have a couple of \"white pill\" beliefs about Trump & the economy-- which pretty-much bail him out of trouble (in my mind) on nearly-any occasion:   1.) Whenever Trump makes an unconventional move, it-- by definition-- defies conventional opinion.  So it's super-easy to complain, on conventional grounds.  But conventional thinking is the wrong way to judge unconventional actions.   2.)  US economic policy has been so mindlessly conventional-- for So Long!-- that ANY move away from the Same Old Shit-- will have at-least a momentary \"Change Dividend\".     For example, taking the flippers off your feet & using them to paddle with your hands is-- in general-- a bad idea.  EXCEPT, if you've been using only your legs to swim 50 miles... then, yeah, your legs are probably exhausted & your arms Will Be better (temporarily).    That applies to things like Tariffs.   I think they're good.  I may be wrong.  But the US has been SO anti-tariff... for So Long... that switching to tariffs provides Short Term relief.  EVEN IF tariffs are (perhaps) bad policy In The Long Run. That said--  it's not good-- when Trump's pronouncements and policies don't clearly make sense On Their Own...   causing me to have to dip into my bottle of White Pills. permalink parent award report block reply Faintlight 4 points 9 hours ago Too much support for Bibi. permalink parent award report block reply RyanKeyOh 2 points 9 hours ago H1B permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments...

I've been wondering  myself how the hell are we going to fill all the high tech positions coming. Surely not with a whole generation of entitled children that don't want to work. Believe me I want as little H1B's as possible, if any, but I'm sure they've been crunching the numbers and they need 2+2 to equal 4 and not 5 to make the coming high tech industrial boom not fail before it's even off the ground. Without more information I'm in the same boat as most people, No H1B's but I also want America to be at the fore front of the next high tech industrial revolution regardless. The next few years could make or break this Country. permalink parent award report block reply CaptainCuomo 3 points 4 hours ago \"$20 Trillion by the end of the year\". That's a crazy number. The US GDP has been above $20 Trillion every year-- since 2017.  So that's not some new record being broken. There is NOT another $20 Trillion in foreign investments arriving by the end of the year. Nor is there $20 Trillion in tariffs being collected-- not even close. So... no... there is not $20 Trillion dollars of Demand pouring into US high-tech labor markets/ with no American workers to fill those spots. \"Stupid Bitch!!!\" You want her to be like the Dem FAKE NEWS-- and not ask our President the real, obvious questions on MAGA voters' minds?! I have a couple of \"white pill\" beliefs about Trump & the economy-- which pretty-much bail him out of trouble (in my mind) on nearly-any occasion:   1.) Whenever Trump makes an unconventional move, it-- by definition-- defies conventional opinion.  So it's super-easy to complain, on conventional grounds.  But conventional thinking is the wrong way to judge unconventional actions.   2.)  US economic policy has been so mindlessly conventional-- for So Long!-- that ANY move away from the Same Old Shit-- will have at-least a momentary \"Change Dividend\".     For example, taking the flippers off your feet & using them to paddle with your hands is-- in general-- a bad idea.  EXCEPT, if you've been using only your legs to swim 50 miles... then, yeah, your legs are probably exhausted & your arms Will Be better (temporarily).    That applies to things like Tariffs.   I think they're good.  I may be wrong.  But the US has been SO anti-tariff... for So Long... that switching to tariffs provides Short Term relief.  EVEN IF tariffs are (perhaps) bad policy In The Long Run. That said--  it's not good-- when Trump's pronouncements and policies don't clearly make sense On Their Own...   causing me to have to dip into my bottle of White Pills. permalink parent award report block reply Faintlight 4 points 9 hours ago Too much support for Bibi. permalink parent award report block reply RyanKeyOh 2 points 9 hours ago H1B permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments...\nAppalachianTactical 93 points 10 hours ago Trump saying we need to import millions of Indian H1Bs because Americans aren't smart enough to do the job. permalink parent award report block reply Hangemh1gh 73 points 10 hours ago The whole fifty year mortgage thing hasn't helped either. permalink parent award report block reply AppalachianTactical 33 points 10 hours ago Yeah, and I dont even think its that big of a deal, but when you are talking 50 year mortgages on top of getting rid of the penny and americans arent smart enough to do the tech jobs, it just looks hackney. 50 year mortgage could have its place maybe helping 20 year olds get a house, but whats scary is the elite are thinking raise retirement age too.

Key word he was responding to is \"plenty\" and than Ingraham shoots back with \"we don't have talented people here?\" Stupid Bitch!!! and now TDS infected anti-trumpers are running with what she said and not what POTUS was saying is that we won't have ENOUGH people in certain areas. I know, I know..... he could have spelled it out better but hearing him talk about the trillions of dollars in investments pouring into our country what like $20 trillion by the end of the year. I've been wondering  myself how the hell are we going to fill all the high tech positions coming. Surely not with a whole generation of entitled children that don't want to work. Believe me I want as little H1B's as possible, if any, but I'm sure they've been crunching the numbers and they need 2+2 to equal 4 and not 5 to make the coming high tech industrial boom not fail before it's even off the ground. Without more information I'm in the same boat as most people, No H1B's but I also want America to be at the fore front of the next high tech industrial revolution regardless. The next few years could make or break this Country. permalink parent award report block reply CaptainCuomo 3 points 4 hours ago \"$20 Trillion by the end of the year\". That's a crazy number. The US GDP has been above $20 Trillion every year-- since 2017.  So that's not some new record being broken. There is NOT another $20 Trillion in foreign investments arriving by the end of the year. Nor is there $20 Trillion in tariffs being collected-- not even close. So... no... there is not $20 Trillion dollars of Demand pouring into US high-tech labor markets/ with no American workers to fill those spots. \"Stupid Bitch!!!\" You want her to be like the Dem FAKE NEWS-- and not ask our President the real, obvious questions on MAGA voters' minds?! I have a couple of \"white pill\" beliefs about Trump & the economy-- which pretty-much bail him out of trouble (in my mind) on nearly-any occasion:   1.) Whenever Trump makes an unconventional move, it-- by definition-- defies conventional opinion.  So it's super-easy to complain, on conventional grounds.  But conventional thinking is the wrong way to judge unconventional actions.   2.)  US economic policy has been so mindlessly conventional-- for So Long!-- that ANY move away from the Same Old Shit-- will have at-least a momentary \"Change Dividend\".

Then add on the Israel first bullshit (which is absolutely true) I love the guy but he seriously needs to get his head out of his ass now because he's starting to look about like the sons of bitches in congress who hate us and only exist to steal our wealth. permalink award report block reply\nRobinNet 2 points 10 hours ago turn on my smart watch... nope- still got a pulse. permalink award report block reply\npresticus 2 points 11 hours ago If Nick Fuentes & Dean Withers agree on something you know they're both retarded. permalink award report block reply\nThatsGold 2 points 10 hours ago It was a good run permalink award report block reply\nPatriotDescendant 2 points 2 hours ago Trump's thoughts on H1Bs is asinine/naive/misinformed, as is the 50 year mortgage thing.

What will cause the insane optimism next week? permalink award report block reply\nDomTullipso 1 points 4 hours ago And Trump killed it by saying \"Epstein who?

We need to evolve toward America First or we will never be great again, importing endless Indians to take the white collar jobs and Mexicans to take the manual labor and chjn3se students to become the future ph.Ds. permalink award report block reply\nIt_takes_10_years 1 points 2 hours ago Nick Fuentes is right about everything. permalink award report block reply\nCocaineNewsome 1 points 3 hours ago Turns out we were the MAGA all along. permalink award report block reply\nThan0sIII 1 points 11 hours ago Retarded purity testing.

Maga is bigger than one man, and I hope he has some grand plan because at the moment he is losing people who stuck but him.  You can go full reddit faggot and demand tribal loyalty over conviction but that just proves you were never maga to begin with. permalink award report block reply\nBacha_Bazi_Biden 0 points 1 hour ago Israel\u2019s actions in the Middle East have brought Trump\u2019s relationship with Israel and their influence over our government into question. You\u2019re now called \u201cAnti-Semitic\u201d by people that claim they\u2019re MAGA for any criticisms of Israel. Only 400,000 illegal aliens have been deported since his second term starts. Only 49,600,000 left. 50 year mortgages that our children or grandchildren will have to pay off sounds retarded at face value. H1B scam hasn\u2019t been nipped in the bud, with Elon being a big beneficiary of the loophole. You can disagree like what I\u2019m saying, but everything above is dividing the base, especially Israel. permalink award report block reply\nMhmm2MoreWeeks 0 points 10 hours ago MAGA is not dead.
