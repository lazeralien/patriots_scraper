It's Authoritarian and no friend to America.  At the moment, Russia is arming the dictator in Venezuela and supplying China with fuel and military technology.

No, it's not.... You need to review the Tucker - Putin interview again.  Putin lays claim to much of Ukraine.  He believes the land is Russian territory.  He was always going to try to get it back within the borders of Russia. In any case, Russia is not a Free Nation, nor a friend to America.  It's an unfriendly nation, and has consistently supported nations unfriendly to America.... both during and after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Sadly, there's a large contingent of simpletons posting around here who like to claim that Russia is somehow akin to MAGA.  And it's just not. Russia is an unfriendly and Non-Free Nation. She is a dangerous adversary armed with stolen American nuclear weapon technology and easy access to Chinese factories where the vast majority of the world's technology is manufactured. permalink parent award report block reply SenorTrumper OP 4 points 1 day ago Son, you sound young and naive. You are a victim of propaganda. NATO pushed cocainsky into provoking a military response from Russia.  Why?  Well, Europe is swirling the drain economically.  So they came up with the brilliant idea of going to war with Russia, breaking it up into pieces which would then be distributed to the UK, France, Germany, Poland and a few others. Unfortunately for the EU/NATO, Russia kicked ass. It went to war with the 32 members of NATO and neutralized them.  NATO has shown itself that without the US it's a collection of barking chihuahuas. We now know that Ukraine has suffered almost 2 million KIA based on the leaked data. In contrast, Russia has at most 150K KIA. The USA had around 500K KIA in all of WW II. NATO is expected to breakup shortly as most members realize it's a paper tiger and the cost of membership is no longer worth it. permalink parent award report block reply SenorTrumper OP 2 points 1 day ago That's payback for how we have tried to fuck Russia by using the retard nation of Ukraine as a proxy.

Russia's alliance with China is 100% American's fault because it left them literally no other choice except to either form those close ties with their neighbor or be wiped out. All that said, Russia is currently closest to US ideologically in terms of what a country should be on paper and I would argue that its actually closer to what the founding fathers envisioned than what USA currently is. The biggest difference in their constitution and legal framework is the right to own weapons. words like 'authoritarian' are meaningless today.

Even the constant accusations of 'Putin murders his opposition' - US  and EU each has a much longer list of dead dissidents that were murdered. That's not even going into how a lot of the 'dissidents' that Putin allegedly had killed, died in custody of the British or EU.

Manufacturing everything in China has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Russia-China-India alliances past, present, or future. Your attempt at such an assertion necessarily means that I should not take you seriously on this subject. Those people attempting to elevate Russia to the status of a somewhat MAGA aligned nation are morons.

Um.... well... what's this? https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950v06/d157 On February 14, 1950, the Governments of the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China signed a 30-year Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance which was ratified by both sides and entered into force on April 11, 1950. In addition, the two states concluded two agreements and three exchanges of notes. Th.... Oh! That was BEFORE.... Ah... so much different than now. Maybe not. All you Russia fans are idiots. permalink parent award report block reply iamherefortheluls 2 points 1 day ago the idiot thing here is to look at diplomatic platitudes rather than actions. Soviet Union never handed over the entire western economy to China or invested hundreds of billions of US dollars into them. China would be just another Pakistan if US hasn't made it into the global power it is today. permalink parent award report block reply 24601 1 points 1 day ago China - Russia - India .... all products of the theft of US technology and cash via the US branch of the Communist International embedded within the State Department and other areas of US Government during the early to late 20th Century. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... ariloulaleelay 1 points 1 day ago An absolutely ignorant take. It's true that USSR funded Chinese revolution, hoping to receive a vassal that way. It's also true that China have gained everything it could from USSR and then told it to fuck itself sideways, and afterwards their relationships have been pretty much a cold war with some hot phases too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict Do you think USA would've moved its industrial potential to China if it was USSR's ally? It did so because China was its enemy so it was an enemy of the enemy thing. permalink parent award report block reply 24601 1 points 1 day ago Do you think USA would've moved its industrial potential to China if it was USSR's ally?

The world is more complex than two or three competing ideological entities. The only way \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" functions to the benefit of the speaker, is if the speaker is Machiavelli. One must be prepared to destroy the \"friend.\"  Otherwise, one will lose. A much better idea is, the enemy of Constitutional governance is my enemy. permalink parent award report block reply\n24601 0 points 1 day ago No.  That doesn't work.
