I'm a repair tech for a dental company, and my coworker is a repair associate (level below a tech, more customer support). He's literal a poster child for a Mamadani voter. He's a fat, agnostic, neck beard socialist. On top of that he has literal tantrum/anger issues. He bitches about not making enough money and how he wishes he was a tech. The lead tech and I offer to train him on how to do repair jobs so he can beef up his resume. Basically paid training. He's a lazy piece of shit and says he will only do repair work if he's getting paid a repair tech salary. He turns down the training. Four months later our older tech retires, and he puts in an application. Management asks him if he has any repair experience. NOPE. Now he bitches and moans about how the company should have made him a tech based on the type of person he is and not his ability to repair. Mind you, both the lead tech and I have experience and degrees in our field.  Again, he's a fat, neck beard socialist who makes shit money and is happy that Mamdani was elected. Now we \"...can see\" how great socialism will be. End of story, people who support socialism are generally lazy, unmotivated fucks who only want gibbs for little to not work. permalink parent award report block reply FrmrAmericanRepublic 12 points 4 days ago True - they don't understand achievment via their own merits and expect everything handed to them.

Insult them, and many times it goes right over their heads. permalink parent award report block reply user2827 3 points 4 days ago I can't relate to that industry, but the logic is ass backwards. The way I've seen it happen is closer to, guy gets hired as an equipment operator, shows that he's good at what he does, then a surge of work and the programmer can't keep up with demand and so they get asked to help the programmer.  Usually sooner than later, it's then that the offer for more pay in exchange for more responsibilities is offered. I've never seen happen any different way, except for cost of living adjustments. permalink parent award report block reply Thrasymachus 6 points 4 days ago This reveals one of the hard truths of the labor market.  You have to plan as if nobody has any goodness in their heart, because it's foolhardy to rely on it.  You have to rely on LEVERAGE, and consider things transactionally. When that equipment operator you mentioned is working at a programmer, their employer can and usually will start to rely on that level of skill and productivity.  At that point the employee has the ability to say, no, I think I'll take these skills elsewhere.  To the employer, it doesn't matter if the operator takes that skill to a competitor or starts living in a van down by the river, the result is, they lose an asset.  To avoid that, they have to pay him commensurately with the higher tier work he's doing. I only asked for a raise based on the naive assumption of \"It's Been A While\" once and I felt like an asshole when I realized it was presumptuous since I was still doing the same amount of work.  Instead I chose to add responsibilities and that made it easy and fair to ask for more money as a proportion of the business I brought it.  Create more value, earn more money. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

Hopefully many of them change their philosophy after years of grinding into a career and seeing how shitty many people are that don\u2019t deserve shit from our taxpayer money or healthcare contributions.  Also many are brainwashed by their socialist loser high school teachers and college professors, as well as being brainwashed by pop media culture. permalink parent award report block reply IvanDrago 6 points 4 days ago Sales. I started the grind early selling golf balls, soda, plowing snow, mowing yards. Persuasion is an important life skill, because even if you're right, if you can't communicate it, the intellectual capacity is wasted. The earlier you get working, the sooner you figure out who the leeches are and how it's stolen from you. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 3 points 4 days ago But even that ..  you aren't paying rent and bills selling golf balls and soda .  But your point is valid.   Some people do have better work ethic values than others.  But just because someone is young and inexperienced making cheap wages working at Starbucks 30hrs a week  while 15 hours of classes (not concluding projects and homework/studying) in college doesn\u2019t mean they are lazy.  They are probably misguided mostly, imo. permalink parent award report block reply Thrasymachus 3 points 4 days ago The fact that the dollar has been used as an instrument of the Federal Reserve board to siphon trillions of dollars of value from American labor to European bank accounts makes it so wages for unskilled labor is basically trash, appropriate for people who can wire it home to Mexico where it goes a lot further, or children who are still subsidized by their parents.  At one time that wage would have been able to support a livelihood with some thrift and careful planning.  Combine that with Marxist professors who tell them every made-up and ideological reason for these ills except the real ones and you can see how fertile the ground is for the radicalization of youth.  Add in the particular impressionability of young women based on illusory consensus and you've got...modern normie politics. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I remember when a single earing on a guy was apparently a signal, but since it was before the internet nobody was sure which ear was the gay one.  I was like, I'm pretty sure a guy with one single earing, you can just assume he's gay it probably doesn't matter which.

I turn it around on them with something new every time some idiot has the nerve to ask. My local Publix has a hijab wearing sheniqua working as a cashier, and her disdain for whites is nearly equal to my disdain of her ilk. Last time she asked, I said \u201c I will tell you like I told that junky in the parking lot on my way in, no. \u201c Bitch was seething and could do nothing about it. Have also just said  \u201c no, I\u2019ve had a tough month and was hoping you could round down to the nearest 50.\u201d They don\u2019t ask me that shit anymore, after going to the manager desk several times and letting them know that times are hard, prices are high, and they shouldn\u2019t be trying to embarrass their customers into paying even more for their groceries . It is a shitty way to conduct business, and I guarantee that the money never reaches anyone but those high paid administrators at the top of the charities. This country has changed so much since I was a kid.

Now who pays? permalink parent award report block reply RentFree2020 OP 2 points 4 days ago Well, try this out a few times and report back. permalink parent award report block reply HeCantDoIt 1 points 4 days ago I already did. I had this exact conversation with my ex, and a couple of my co-workers a few years ago. One time my ex was complaining to me about her experience at a recent dental appointment, and our conversation veered into \"free healthcare\" territory. I forget how the whole convo went, but I probably said something like \"OK, then who is going to pay for it? Do you want your taxes to go up, or for inflation to go up due to all the money-printing required to 'pay' for it?\". She ignored my argument and just said that rich people can pay for it... And at a previous workplace, the topic of socialism got brought up once, and me 2 of my friends there hashed it out a bit. I remember saying: \"socialism is only possible because you give power to a tiny group of extremely corrupt people, who don't give a fuck about you, and who force you through the government's monopoly on violence, to hand-over huge chunks of your paycheck to pay for free things everyone wants. There's nothing voluntary or 'social' about that\". They didn't get mad, but just told me \"but the rich will pay for it, what's the problem\", and \"you're young and haven't studied these things, so of course you don't know how proper socialism could be done\". No anger or hostility in both instances, just coyness and \"the rich will pay for it!\". Also, while not quite related, a similar thing also happened on Reddit a few weeks ago. Some reddit fags were bitching about publicly-traded companies doing stupid things and being corrupted by shareholders, and I said \"part of the reason there's so much money sloshing around in the stock market is because the rich are FORCED to invest to protect their money, so that retarded beaurocrats don't get it through taxes and waste it instantly\". Their answer? \"Just tax the stock market for the rich!\". In these people's minds, their thought process is simply \"the rich have infinitely more than all of us, therefore why take from me?\". And breaking down that leg of their argument is impossible, because it'd require a tiny bit of abstract thinking (eg, rich people create jobs, invest in automation, increase wages by increasing demand for workers, etc.) - an ability none of them have. permalink parent award report block reply thisisatestof2 1 points 4 days ago Kek permalink award report block reply 5DchessWatch 1 points 4 days ago That's resting defaultbitchmode permalink award report block reply hnoble444 1 points 4 days ago LOL.

Hopefully many of them change their philosophy after years of grinding into a career and seeing how shitty many people are that don\u2019t deserve shit from our taxpayer money or healthcare contributions.  Also many are brainwashed by their socialist loser high school teachers and college professors, as well as being brainwashed by pop media culture. permalink parent award report block reply IvanDrago 6 points 4 days ago Sales. I started the grind early selling golf balls, soda, plowing snow, mowing yards. Persuasion is an important life skill, because even if you're right, if you can't communicate it, the intellectual capacity is wasted. The earlier you get working, the sooner you figure out who the leeches are and how it's stolen from you. permalink parent award report block reply wilburh09 3 points 4 days ago But even that ..  you aren't paying rent and bills selling golf balls and soda .  But your point is valid.   Some people do have better work ethic values than others.  But just because someone is young and inexperienced making cheap wages working at Starbucks 30hrs a week  while 15 hours of classes (not concluding projects and homework/studying) in college doesn\u2019t mean they are lazy.  They are probably misguided mostly, imo. permalink parent award report block reply Thrasymachus 3 points 4 days ago The fact that the dollar has been used as an instrument of the Federal Reserve board to siphon trillions of dollars of value from American labor to European bank accounts makes it so wages for unskilled labor is basically trash, appropriate for people who can wire it home to Mexico where it goes a lot further, or children who are still subsidized by their parents.  At one time that wage would have been able to support a livelihood with some thrift and careful planning.  Combine that with Marxist professors who tell them every made-up and ideological reason for these ills except the real ones and you can see how fertile the ground is for the radicalization of youth.  Add in the particular impressionability of young women based on illusory consensus and you've got...modern normie politics. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I'm a repair tech for a dental company, and my coworker is a repair associate (level below a tech, more customer support). He's literal a poster child for a Mamadani voter. He's a fat, agnostic, neck beard socialist. On top of that he has literal tantrum/anger issues. He bitches about not making enough money and how he wishes he was a tech. The lead tech and I offer to train him on how to do repair jobs so he can beef up his resume. Basically paid training. He's a lazy piece of shit and says he will only do repair work if he's getting paid a repair tech salary. He turns down the training. Four months later our older tech retires, and he puts in an application. Management asks him if he has any repair experience. NOPE. Now he bitches and moans about how the company should have made him a tech based on the type of person he is and not his ability to repair. Mind you, both the lead tech and I have experience and degrees in our field.  Again, he's a fat, neck beard socialist who makes shit money and is happy that Mamdani was elected.

When that equipment operator you mentioned is working at a programmer, their employer can and usually will start to rely on that level of skill and productivity.  At that point the employee has the ability to say, no, I think I'll take these skills elsewhere.  To the employer, it doesn't matter if the operator takes that skill to a competitor or starts living in a van down by the river, the result is, they lose an asset.  To avoid that, they have to pay him commensurately with the higher tier work he's doing. I only asked for a raise based on the naive assumption of \"It's Been A While\" once and I felt like an asshole when I realized it was presumptuous since I was still doing the same amount of work.

I had this exact conversation with my ex, and a couple of my co-workers a few years ago. One time my ex was complaining to me about her experience at a recent dental appointment, and our conversation veered into \"free healthcare\" territory. I forget how the whole convo went, but I probably said something like \"OK, then who is going to pay for it? Do you want your taxes to go up, or for inflation to go up due to all the money-printing required to 'pay' for it?\". She ignored my argument and just said that rich people can pay for it... And at a previous workplace, the topic of socialism got brought up once, and me 2 of my friends there hashed it out a bit. I remember saying: \"socialism is only possible because you give power to a tiny group of extremely corrupt people, who don't give a fuck about you, and who force you through the government's monopoly on violence, to hand-over huge chunks of your paycheck to pay for free things everyone wants. There's nothing voluntary or 'social' about that\". They didn't get mad, but just told me \"but the rich will pay for it, what's the problem\", and \"you're young and haven't studied these things, so of course you don't know how proper socialism could be done\". No anger or hostility in both instances, just coyness and \"the rich will pay for it!\". Also, while not quite related, a similar thing also happened on Reddit a few weeks ago. Some reddit fags were bitching about publicly-traded companies doing stupid things and being corrupted by shareholders, and I said \"part of the reason there's so much money sloshing around in the stock market is because the rich are FORCED to invest to protect their money, so that retarded beaurocrats don't get it through taxes and waste it instantly\". Their answer? \"Just tax the stock market for the rich!\". In these people's minds, their thought process is simply \"the rich have infinitely more than all of us, therefore why take from me?\". And breaking down that leg of their argument is impossible, because it'd require a tiny bit of abstract thinking (eg, rich people create jobs, invest in automation, increase wages by increasing demand for workers, etc.) - an ability none of them have. permalink parent award report block reply\nNellie_the_Beaut 4 points 4 days ago They also theorize that if the government just taxes all these billionaires more - or better yet, just \u201cseizes their wealth and properties because nobody needs that much money and it\u2019s immoral to be that rich\u201d -  they could finally have the socialist utopia they dream about.

It's not a profession, it's not a skilled trade. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 2 points 4 days ago This is America where we tip to reward and encourage proper American customer service. Go back to Europe or Israel or Cuba where you don't have to tip. permalink parent award report block reply view 9 more comments...\nmailinvoter 1 points 4 days ago What a tard! Haha, faggot. I'll have a viente mocha with whipped cream, no soy! permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Lol. You go to Starbucks, faggot? And you get whipped cream? Ha! Americans order coffee in small, medium, or large. You can alternatively say 8, 12, or 16 oz. I don't even know what a venti means. And with your clear homosexuality, you should also get glitter sprinkles on top, too. Funny that you call me a faggot and then order one of the gayest drinks. But I know you Starbucks gays can get fruitier. Your degeneracy knows no bounds. permalink parent award report block reply mailinvoter 1 points 4 days ago No, I don't pay $25 for a cup of coffee flavored corn syrup. I grind my own beans at home (ironically, I do buy Starbucks brand beans when I get a 64oz bag for $3, but I digress). Just like I may speak a little Spanish doesn't make me a Messican, I speak a little faggot to interact with your kind. Sorry to lead you on, homoboy, but I don't let twinks pump and dump my butthole or get monkey pox sores in my throat like you. Go buy a coffee grinder, a decent brewer, and stop being a faggot that buys brown hot water from Dunkin Donuts. Oh wait, I forgot what this was even about. Nobody here wants US citizens to be on food stamps.  They are making fun of the people who voted to be fucked in the ass by a communist, and saying they can start paying the extra taxes they signed everyone else up for. I was calling you out for your retarded ass take on the situation.  These people were probably already on food stamps since they work for a coffee shop in their late twenties while living in New York City. They are going to learn that retarded actions have consequences. Also, yes, you are a faggot. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 1 day ago Lol. You are talking about grindr coffee and explaining it in detail. You clearly like the penis. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...\nsordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Lol.

Also, blame the billion dollar corporation that's worshipped by them to pay them a wage. Seriously, all you fucking retards don't understand this. Not to mention these kinds of jobs were designed for high school and college kids. No one intended for putting milk in coffee to be a career. Fucking loser. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 1 points 4 days ago Hey, I don't live in your community, so I don't care if you mistreat your fellow man. Just don't be surprised when the young people vote to take your money. You'll get the government you deserve. permalink parent award report block reply RentFree2020 OP 1 points 4 days ago Why is your position that we are under paying them?
