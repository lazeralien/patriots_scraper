Didn't know that permalink parent award report block reply IHateUntruth 10 points 6 days ago Most cancers are more glucose addicted but some heavily rely on fats instead and prostate is a textbook example. The prostate is unlike many other tissues in that instead of using citrate for energy in the Krebs cycle it gets diverted because seminal fluid needs high amounts of citrate to be stable. Prostate cancer subverts that and starts using citrate for energy and to make fats for lipid membranes, lipid rafts and cell signaling lipids. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is usually one of the most upregulated genes in prostate cancer. So is AMACR. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 5 points 6 days ago That's extremely interesting.   Most cancers use glucose though so a low sugar or no sugar diet combined with Keto can help prevent cancers and aid in the treatment of existing cancers. I guess why prostrate cancer is such a tough one to beat is because it can simply use fat from the body to power it's growth. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... memechallenger33 2 points 6 days ago Very interesting.

However, I don't think the Zelenko protocol cures or prevents everything.  It's a really good start, but it's a start.

What do you want him to do walk around in excruciating pain wearing a hair shirt whipping himself? Look, I'm a pureblood.  I convinced my husband and kids to not get the jab, mostly because my husband was very supportive of me when I brought it to his attention how bad mRNA jabs could be. I tried to warn 86 of my relatives in March 2021.  They laughed at me for being a Trump supporter and also because I had a recent conversion to Catholicism (2019).    I made handouts for all of them and spent money on steak dinners for them.  They threw away the handouts and called me a nut for two years.  I have 63 relatives today. How long do you want to make the ones who came to understand they were on the wrong side pay for being on the wrong side?  How much more do you want to put them through?   Instead of going after the ones who are truly hurting and have come to understand the problem in truth, how about directing the energy to those who are still acting like wimps, cowards and refuse to believe anything that isn't on TheNews\u2122. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 2 points 6 days ago Sorry to hear about your Conversion. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 6 days ago You shouldn't be.

Ketosis is a cure for cancer. permalink award report block reply Smurfection 0 points 6 days ago actually, as per IHateUntruth as above, prostrate cancer is one of the few cancers that can use fat.  Human bodies don't need sugar at all....the sugar we do need can be made via a process called gluconeogensis.   However, humans do need fat to live.  Prostrate cancer is one of the cancers that can use body fat. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 3 points 6 days ago u/IHateUntruth I would invite him to expand on that further. There is ample research suggesting a keto diet affects prostate cancer roughly the same as all other cancer cells. It is unclear from this user's post whether a high fat diet aggravates the condition he describes, since fats consumed orally don't enter the blood as fat, but as triglycerides. He said: some heavily rely on fats instead and prostate is a textbook example ... did he mean to say they rely on triglycerides? Because if not, dietary fat would not be feeding fats to prostate, or any other cells. Typically, one finds high triglycerides and high body fat content in people who are not in ketosis, since their bodies don't consume fat as fuel. Once one enters ketosis, one's body fat typically melts away since all fat, everywhere, is fuel. I consider it far more likely that \"being fat\" aggravates the condition that user describes, rather than \"being in ketosis.\" However, I'm just an autistic retard who outsmarted trillions of dollars in propaganda and the entire health care system and all the \"experts\" on covid and the poison vaxxes, it's very possible I'm just wrong. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 6 days ago Ya know, I want to see IHateUntruth expand on this as well.   I hope he provides a link or something to back it up.   I do not have a medical degree and I dabble in the subject so by no means can I accurately evaluate this. I just googled it and was surprised to see some indication that he may be right.   As per other doctors I watch on YouTube etc, they say all cancers thrive on glucose and in all cases getting the body as close to zero sugar as possible is a good thing and aids in prevention, treatment and recovery. I've been Keto now for almost three years now, off and on.  I have had enormous improvement in my physical health, mental health, energy levels and my cooking skills even dramatically improved.  The keto recipes I've come up with are great! I can't judge though, between what you're saying and what he's saying.  I just noticed that there was some evidence he's right and again, I can't really fully evaluate it.  I'd love to see you and u/IHateUntruth discuss this. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 2 points 6 days ago I have had a similar experience with going on a high fat diet and existing in ketosis. If not doing this causes cancer, and doing this also causes cancer, we're fucked either way which doesn't seem quite right. permalink parent award report block reply view 7 more comments... IHateUntruth 1 points 6 days ago I can't see the parent comment for some reason, but I explained more here: https://patriots.win/p/1ARK5132Q8/please-pray-for-scott-this-morni/c/4eXu1OpVzW7 I don't have papers for you on hand, this is just stuff I know, but you can confirm by looking at the research literature on google scholar or something permalink parent award report block reply IHateUntruth 2 points 6 days ago For some reason this post was not visible to me and I had to use a private tab to find it... First, you're right (and I did mention this in another post), a full on keto diet where the body is running more on ketone oxidation than fatty acid oxidation would still be a good idea for this cancer. But not just merely reducing glucose intake some. And preferably high MCT. For most keto diets it's still >60% FAO to <40% KO. It is unclear from this user's post whether a high fat diet aggravates the condition he describes, since fats consumed orally don't enter the blood as fat, but as triglycerides... did he mean to say they rely on triglycerides? Because if not, dietary fat would not be feeding fats to prostate, or any other cells. It's the same thing, effectively. If we want to be super technical, cells can't actually absorb triglycerides because they're too big and hydrophobic to diffuse or use FATPs the way free fatty acids do. TGs are packaged as chylomicrons. And the chylomicron is broken down outside the cell by LPL to deliver FFAs across the cell membrane. What we're dealing with is FFAs from lipolysis as well as from chylomicrons from meals and an endocytosed contribution from VLDL too. That's all just a description of the systemic transport mechanisms, not the tissue/cell level metabolic mechanisms. It's all fatty acid metabolism at the cell level. Regardless of how the fats get to the cell - as FFAs, TG-bearing chylomicrons, or VLDL - they become FFAs and then 'fatty acyl-CoA' in the cytoplasm and undergo beta oxidation or are otherwise used in exactly the same way. Fatty acid metabolism is distinct from ketone metabolism, especially in terms of cancer. Fatty acids produce FADH2 when oxidized. FADH2 is responsible for delivering electrons to Complex II of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). This is a low reactive oxygen species (ROS) route. Remember, cancer is vulnerable to oxidative stress from those ROS. High FADH2 = low stress = low vulnerability. Ketones don't produce any FADH2 when oxidized which increases cancer's ROS burden. Further to that effect, ketones are metabolized thru Complex I, which generally yields more ROS. Also, FAO produces over 6x the amount of NADH than the equivalent in KO. NADH is a reducing agent and protects the cancer from oxidative stress, and can also promote glycolysis by modulating the Krebs cycle. It also helps export citrate which if converted to itaconate will further activate HIF. And the exported citrate also promotes cytoplasmic biosynthesis of fats and their uses. The high NADH also reduces the NAD+/NADH ratio, inhibiting sirtuins which are usually a brake on cell proliferation. Another important aspect is that unlike FAO ketone oxidation depletes succinyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle. Succinyl-CoA is important for biosyntheses that cancers rely on to grow and protect themselves. It also helps stabilize and activate the hypoxia sensor HIF which is important to cancer metabolism and signaling (driving glycolysis, etc.) It also helps make heme which cancer uses to drive further cataplerosis. Further, aside from oxidative metabolism, fatty acids are also important building blocks for cell membranes, lipid rafts, lipid droplets (energy stores helping cells survive stress) and a variety of signaling molecules (eicosanoids, glycolipids, sphingolipids, etc.) and post-translational modifications (for example, palmitoylation of Wnt from palmitic acid). Ketones can't do any of that, they can only be burned. And many cancers are deficient in ketone metabolizing enzymes like OXCT1 so they can't even get much energy from them - the body is fed but the cancer is starved. There are a few cancers that thrive on ketones, but those are rare and this is not one of them. I will repeat though that most keto diets are still >60% FAO. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 1 points 6 days ago Thank you, very informative, and good to confirm that a good keto diet in which you're turning lots of fat into ketone bodies is hostile to most cancers. Honestly, the only problem most people have getting into such a diet is lack of willpower. permalink parent award report block reply Reefay -2 points 6 days ago Nope. permalink award report block reply R3tro -3 points 6 days ago Maybe he should take fenbendazole and horse paste (that he made fun of during covid times) permalink award report block reply IHateUntruth -3 points 6 days ago He should use herbs.

You just don't want to accept that he came full circle.  I can understand that.  I was fighting a daily battle to keep my husband and my kids purebloods.   I got ostracized from my family along with my husband and kids.  We got disinvited from Thanksgiving and Easter on both sides.  I had to tell my daughter she couldn't take a class trip to Ireland.   You just try to tell an 18 year old girl she can't go to Ireland with her friends. Scott Adams eventually joined us.  He got on board late but he did get on board. permalink parent award report block reply Reefay 0 points 6 days ago Too little too late for me. When the whole covid shot came out he should have said hey I'm a cartoon peddler and I'm not a scientist. I'm going to get this shot but make your own decision. But what he did was ridicule and use his authority of being wealthy and smarter than thou. It just doesn't sit well with me and it never will. No matter how many apologies he gives now. He should have just come out right at the beginning and said I'm really sorry I really hope that the cancer takes him so that maybe he'll realize how much of an asshole he was permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... Smurfection 3 points 6 days ago yep.  Scott Adams has also said a few times now, he was wrong about the jab.   There were a lot of good people who were duped.   At the time, I was more upset with them because each person who went along with the psyop was another person adding to the psyop and adding to the pressure on purebloods like me.  Each time an employee let an employer dictate what medical injections had to be administered was another convention that kept employers out of employee's healthcare and medical treatments that eroded.  Bulwark after Bulwark was crumbling by every smiling goon who stuck out their arms and received the poison jab.  Many of them paid with their lives for that and more paid with their health.  It's more than five years now.   I forgive the ones who admit the error, wholeheartedly and completely, but the ones who still hang to this authoritarian delusion, are my enemies.  Scott Adams isn't one of those. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 1 points 6 days ago My sentiments exactly. permalink parent award report block reply BBWasHere 2 points 4 days ago he attepmted to belittle those who refused because he was \"superior\". fuck him permalink parent award report block reply God-is-good -1 points 6 days ago As we slowly watch Scott deservedly die the sugar coating from sycophants gains layers of thickness capable of choking the simplest minds.

Just wow!  I can't believe you have a username like God-is-good and then go on to say Scott Adams deserves to die.   We all deserve to die and we all will because the wages of sin is death.  That wasn't what God wanted for us though and God doesn't want us to feel pain, die in agony and constantly fear death.  That's not what our loving creator wanted for us.  We did that to ourselves.  All of our deaths, we do to ourselves.   You think God wants Scott Adams to be sick, in agony, despairing and fighting for his life every hour of every day?   God made eternal life for us because we screwed up the prospect of our natural eternal life.   He didn't want us to die.

The prostate is unlike many other tissues in that instead of using citrate for energy in the Krebs cycle it gets diverted because seminal fluid needs high amounts of citrate to be stable. Prostate cancer subverts that and starts using citrate for energy and to make fats for lipid membranes, lipid rafts and cell signaling lipids. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is usually one of the most upregulated genes in prostate cancer. So is AMACR. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 5 points 6 days ago That's extremely interesting.   Most cancers use glucose though so a low sugar or no sugar diet combined with Keto can help prevent cancers and aid in the treatment of existing cancers.

Prostrate cancer is one of the cancers that can use body fat. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 3 points 6 days ago u/IHateUntruth I would invite him to expand on that further. There is ample research suggesting a keto diet affects prostate cancer roughly the same as all other cancer cells. It is unclear from this user's post whether a high fat diet aggravates the condition he describes, since fats consumed orally don't enter the blood as fat, but as triglycerides. He said: some heavily rely on fats instead and prostate is a textbook example ... did he mean to say they rely on triglycerides? Because if not, dietary fat would not be feeding fats to prostate, or any other cells. Typically, one finds high triglycerides and high body fat content in people who are not in ketosis, since their bodies don't consume fat as fuel. Once one enters ketosis, one's body fat typically melts away since all fat, everywhere, is fuel. I consider it far more likely that \"being fat\" aggravates the condition that user describes, rather than \"being in ketosis.\" However, I'm just an autistic retard who outsmarted trillions of dollars in propaganda and the entire health care system and all the \"experts\" on covid and the poison vaxxes, it's very possible I'm just wrong. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 6 days ago Ya know, I want to see IHateUntruth expand on this as well.

As per other doctors I watch on YouTube etc, they say all cancers thrive on glucose and in all cases getting the body as close to zero sugar as possible is a good thing and aids in prevention, treatment and recovery.

First, you're right (and I did mention this in another post), a full on keto diet where the body is running more on ketone oxidation than fatty acid oxidation would still be a good idea for this cancer. But not just merely reducing glucose intake some. And preferably high MCT. For most keto diets it's still >60% FAO to <40% KO. It is unclear from this user's post whether a high fat diet aggravates the condition he describes, since fats consumed orally don't enter the blood as fat, but as triglycerides... did he mean to say they rely on triglycerides? Because if not, dietary fat would not be feeding fats to prostate, or any other cells. It's the same thing, effectively. If we want to be super technical, cells can't actually absorb triglycerides because they're too big and hydrophobic to diffuse or use FATPs the way free fatty acids do. TGs are packaged as chylomicrons. And the chylomicron is broken down outside the cell by LPL to deliver FFAs across the cell membrane. What we're dealing with is FFAs from lipolysis as well as from chylomicrons from meals and an endocytosed contribution from VLDL too. That's all just a description of the systemic transport mechanisms, not the tissue/cell level metabolic mechanisms. It's all fatty acid metabolism at the cell level. Regardless of how the fats get to the cell - as FFAs, TG-bearing chylomicrons, or VLDL - they become FFAs and then 'fatty acyl-CoA' in the cytoplasm and undergo beta oxidation or are otherwise used in exactly the same way. Fatty acid metabolism is distinct from ketone metabolism, especially in terms of cancer. Fatty acids produce FADH2 when oxidized. FADH2 is responsible for delivering electrons to Complex II of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). This is a low reactive oxygen species (ROS) route. Remember, cancer is vulnerable to oxidative stress from those ROS. High FADH2 = low stress = low vulnerability. Ketones don't produce any FADH2 when oxidized which increases cancer's ROS burden. Further to that effect, ketones are metabolized thru Complex I, which generally yields more ROS. Also, FAO produces over 6x the amount of NADH than the equivalent in KO. NADH is a reducing agent and protects the cancer from oxidative stress, and can also promote glycolysis by modulating the Krebs cycle. It also helps export citrate which if converted to itaconate will further activate HIF. And the exported citrate also promotes cytoplasmic biosynthesis of fats and their uses. The high NADH also reduces the NAD+/NADH ratio, inhibiting sirtuins which are usually a brake on cell proliferation. Another important aspect is that unlike FAO ketone oxidation depletes succinyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle. Succinyl-CoA is important for biosyntheses that cancers rely on to grow and protect themselves. It also helps stabilize and activate the hypoxia sensor HIF which is important to cancer metabolism and signaling (driving glycolysis, etc.) It also helps make heme which cancer uses to drive further cataplerosis. Further, aside from oxidative metabolism, fatty acids are also important building blocks for cell membranes, lipid rafts, lipid droplets (energy stores helping cells survive stress) and a variety of signaling molecules (eicosanoids, glycolipids, sphingolipids, etc.) and post-translational modifications (for example, palmitoylation of Wnt from palmitic acid). Ketones can't do any of that, they can only be burned. And many cancers are deficient in ketone metabolizing enzymes like OXCT1 so they can't even get much energy from them - the body is fed but the cancer is starved. There are a few cancers that thrive on ketones, but those are rare and this is not one of them. I will repeat though that most keto diets are still >60% FAO. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 1 points 6 days ago Thank you, very informative, and good to confirm that a good keto diet in which you're turning lots of fat into ketone bodies is hostile to most cancers.

I consider it far more likely that \"being fat\" aggravates the condition that user describes, rather than \"being in ketosis.\" However, I'm just an autistic retard who outsmarted trillions of dollars in propaganda and the entire health care system and all the \"experts\" on covid and the poison vaxxes, it's very possible I'm just wrong. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 6 days ago Ya know, I want to see IHateUntruth expand on this as well.   I hope he provides a link or something to back it up.   I do not have a medical degree and I dabble in the subject so by no means can I accurately evaluate this. I just googled it and was surprised to see some indication that he may be right.   As per other doctors I watch on YouTube etc, they say all cancers thrive on glucose and in all cases getting the body as close to zero sugar as possible is a good thing and aids in prevention, treatment and recovery. I've been Keto now for almost three years now, off and on.  I have had enormous improvement in my physical health, mental health, energy levels and my cooking skills even dramatically improved.  The keto recipes I've come up with are great! I can't judge though, between what you're saying and what he's saying.  I just noticed that there was some evidence he's right and again, I can't really fully evaluate it.  I'd love to see you and u/IHateUntruth discuss this. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 2 points 6 days ago I have had a similar experience with going on a high fat diet and existing in ketosis. If not doing this causes cancer, and doing this also causes cancer, we're fucked either way which doesn't seem quite right. permalink parent award report block reply view 7 more comments...

First, you're right (and I did mention this in another post), a full on keto diet where the body is running more on ketone oxidation than fatty acid oxidation would still be a good idea for this cancer. But not just merely reducing glucose intake some. And preferably high MCT. For most keto diets it's still >60% FAO to <40% KO. It is unclear from this user's post whether a high fat diet aggravates the condition he describes, since fats consumed orally don't enter the blood as fat, but as triglycerides... did he mean to say they rely on triglycerides? Because if not, dietary fat would not be feeding fats to prostate, or any other cells. It's the same thing, effectively. If we want to be super technical, cells can't actually absorb triglycerides because they're too big and hydrophobic to diffuse or use FATPs the way free fatty acids do. TGs are packaged as chylomicrons. And the chylomicron is broken down outside the cell by LPL to deliver FFAs across the cell membrane. What we're dealing with is FFAs from lipolysis as well as from chylomicrons from meals and an endocytosed contribution from VLDL too. That's all just a description of the systemic transport mechanisms, not the tissue/cell level metabolic mechanisms. It's all fatty acid metabolism at the cell level. Regardless of how the fats get to the cell - as FFAs, TG-bearing chylomicrons, or VLDL - they become FFAs and then 'fatty acyl-CoA' in the cytoplasm and undergo beta oxidation or are otherwise used in exactly the same way. Fatty acid metabolism is distinct from ketone metabolism, especially in terms of cancer. Fatty acids produce FADH2 when oxidized. FADH2 is responsible for delivering electrons to Complex II of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). This is a low reactive oxygen species (ROS) route. Remember, cancer is vulnerable to oxidative stress from those ROS. High FADH2 = low stress = low vulnerability. Ketones don't produce any FADH2 when oxidized which increases cancer's ROS burden. Further to that effect, ketones are metabolized thru Complex I, which generally yields more ROS. Also, FAO produces over 6x the amount of NADH than the equivalent in KO. NADH is a reducing agent and protects the cancer from oxidative stress, and can also promote glycolysis by modulating the Krebs cycle. It also helps export citrate which if converted to itaconate will further activate HIF. And the exported citrate also promotes cytoplasmic biosynthesis of fats and their uses. The high NADH also reduces the NAD+/NADH ratio, inhibiting sirtuins which are usually a brake on cell proliferation. Another important aspect is that unlike FAO ketone oxidation depletes succinyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle. Succinyl-CoA is important for biosyntheses that cancers rely on to grow and protect themselves. It also helps stabilize and activate the hypoxia sensor HIF which is important to cancer metabolism and signaling (driving glycolysis, etc.) It also helps make heme which cancer uses to drive further cataplerosis. Further, aside from oxidative metabolism, fatty acids are also important building blocks for cell membranes, lipid rafts, lipid droplets (energy stores helping cells survive stress) and a variety of signaling molecules (eicosanoids, glycolipids, sphingolipids, etc.) and post-translational modifications (for example, palmitoylation of Wnt from palmitic acid). Ketones can't do any of that, they can only be burned. And many cancers are deficient in ketone metabolizing enzymes like OXCT1 so they can't even get much energy from them - the body is fed but the cancer is starved. There are a few cancers that thrive on ketones, but those are rare and this is not one of them. I will repeat though that most keto diets are still >60% FAO. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 1 points 6 days ago Thank you, very informative, and good to confirm that a good keto diet in which you're turning lots of fat into ketone bodies is hostile to most cancers.
