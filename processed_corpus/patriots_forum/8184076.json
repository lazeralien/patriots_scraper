Traitors to the citizens of this country. Most developer/builders are scum. Look at what they have done with the illegal labor they have no shame in using as slaves.

You set up a neighborhood with an HOA.  Then set the bylaws to collect a fee triple what is typical and two thirds of the fee goes to your Church/community center/Jared Taylor Center for White Excellence.  Whatever you set as the center will filter for the kind of people you get.  If someone else moves in, they're still supporting the cause financially. Though that would be if we had the fair application of the law in America.  DNC pet groups can skirt the laws while enemies of the managerial class get the book thrown at them. permalink award report block reply Awan-CIA-Car-Lot 9 points 21 hours ago Jared Taylor Center for White Excellence Perfect!

Religious organizations can't levy fees and taxes on a private home.   An association fee for a community has to have a service or product rendered.  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. What would happen if they charged a fee to Christians that moved in and so the Christians wanted to have a Christian service at the mosque?  If they're paying a fee, they get to use the facility, right?  If you bar the Christians, then it's religious discrimination. permalink award report block reply BKav 5 points 21 hours ago Let\u2019s be fair.

There\u2019s tons of affordable houses, but they\u2019re all in black areas.  That\u2019s why we have a housing crisis.  When people say the prices of housing is out of reach for the American dream now, they only mean white areas near established suburbs(more population- more demand).

However, after looking at two types of properties to escape Illinois, restricted and unrestricted. We chose the restricted property, which is basically an HOA. There are some very nice unrestricted properties. However, they're either not easily accessible or you have neighbors that collect junk and live in trailers, or have both. For $350/year we get paved access to our property, which is plowed to the county road, and simple property restrictions. There are no Karen's complaining about colors, fencing, or the mailbox. However, the restrictions dictate what minimum size and type of house can be built, setbacks for outbuildings, etc. Basically, not all HOAs are bad. However, living under a Sharia HOA has to be the most restrictive use of an HOA that could ever happen. I couldn't imagine being fined 25 lashes for sleeping through the call to prayer. permalink award report block reply Goozmania 1 points 13 hours ago Glen beck left the blaze and within 2 weeks, the blaze ended all their comedy shows; Alex stein and normal world. permalink award report block reply bananafone 1 points 19 hours ago Why don't Christians do this? permalink award report block reply LolitaExpressPilot 1 points 21 hours ago Say what you will about George Bluth Sr. but he'd never do this. permalink award report block reply BusterHyman99 1 points 22 hours ago It's not illegal so there's nothing we can do.

If this was legal don't you think they would be a religious group that would have made a whole town, or a whites only town.  I mean I would dream of having a traditional Catholic city and let me tell ya, traditional Catholics would flock to such a place.  Mormons (not the mainline LDS Mormons) try to pull these sorts of stunts all the time and eventually they all get shut down. Eventually, there will be some sort of dispute that will trigger a lawsuit. permalink parent award report block reply Get_Off_Big_Tech 4 points 21 hours ago Fees go to bacon cheeseburgers at the church. permalink parent award report block reply UltraFrogMan 1 points 14 hours ago Thought they didnt like usury permalink award report block reply Choomguy 4 points 12 hours ago They don\u2019t, but they still pay it on their loans, kinda like this scam.

There\u2019s tons of affordable houses, but they\u2019re all in black areas.  That\u2019s why we have a housing crisis.  When people say the prices of housing is out of reach for the American dream now, they only mean white areas near established suburbs(more population- more demand).  And it\u2019s mostly liberals complaining, yet refusing to live around the people they support so much. permalink award report block reply\nastralentity 2 points 11 hours ago This is nothing new for us is NY.... we still have that Islamberg near Deposit, just north of where SH-8 and SH-10 meet up with I-86. permalink award report block reply\nSeeker_17 2 points 15 hours ago Illegal. permalink award report block reply\nTacitus1963 2 points 16 hours ago And where is the former jogger-in-chief, Valerie Jarrett, Brennan -all Muslims- in all of this? permalink award report block reply\nbill_in_texas 2 points 20 hours ago Deed restrictions: Prohibited: ~Parking on the lawn ~Dogs ~Pork products and pigs ~Bibles ~American flags ~any flavor of homo ~any flavor of non Muslims Required: ~goats ~suicide vests ~trucks of peace ~guns stored at the masjid permalink award report block reply\nBBvarn 2 points 11 hours ago Time for the Negroes to be bussed in. permalink award report block reply\nViagraFalls 2 points 22 hours ago All of the shitty brown people can simply use all the thugs and criminals to make others not want to live there. White people don\u2019t have enough thugs and criminals, and also, there will be some do-gooder snitches turning in white protectors to the police. permalink award report block reply\nfightfightfightx 2 points 21 hours ago illegal but we arent a nation of laws anymore permalink award report block reply\nHikedelics 2 points 22 hours ago So all we have to do is set up neighborhoods where the fee goes towards never allowing an HOA to form and the rest to Turning Point USA? Or someone like David Duke?

However, after looking at two types of properties to escape Illinois, restricted and unrestricted. We chose the restricted property, which is basically an HOA. There are some very nice unrestricted properties. However, they're either not easily accessible or you have neighbors that collect junk and live in trailers, or have both. For $350/year we get paved access to our property, which is plowed to the county road, and simple property restrictions. There are no Karen's complaining about colors, fencing, or the mailbox. However, the restrictions dictate what minimum size and type of house can be built, setbacks for outbuildings, etc. Basically, not all HOAs are bad. However, living under a Sharia HOA has to be the most restrictive use of an HOA that could ever happen. I couldn't imagine being fined 25 lashes for sleeping through the call to prayer. permalink award report block reply\nGoozmania 1 points 13 hours ago Glen beck left the blaze and within 2 weeks, the blaze ended all their comedy shows; Alex stein and normal world. permalink award report block reply\nbananafone 1 points 19 hours ago Why don't Christians do this? permalink award report block reply\nLolitaExpressPilot 1 points 21 hours ago Say what you will about George Bluth Sr. but he'd never do this. permalink award report block reply\nBusterHyman99 1 points 22 hours ago It's not illegal so there's nothing we can do.

If this was legal don't you think they would be a religious group that would have made a whole town, or a whites only town.  I mean I would dream of having a traditional Catholic city and let me tell ya, traditional Catholics would flock to such a place.
