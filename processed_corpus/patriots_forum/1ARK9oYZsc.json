So expect the downvotes for speaking the truth. You can't just jump into an industry we've outsourced since 1980 or so and automatically be #1 in the world on day 1. permalink parent award report block reply\nno_antifa 4 points 11 hours ago Lazy copy paste from a retard permalink parent award report block reply\nReallyGayMods 1 points 11 hours ago \ud83e\udd23 youre right my bad, that was stupid of me, we definitely need room temperature IQ foreigners from India to do all of that for us.

Not sure why you're worried about H-1B when you're barely qualified to work at McDonald's. permalink parent award report block reply Cacciali_Via 0 points 4 hours ago White kids with engineering degrees are having a hard time finding jobs. Fuck off. permalink parent award report block reply ReallyGayMods 0 points 11 hours ago \"can't just take people off the unemployment line and have them start building missiles and batteries\" Somehow thats an issue, but we can take people from India to do that instead? Explain how that works.

They dont seem to understand that we speak up and make changes within our movement for good. We course correct and argue from time to time.
