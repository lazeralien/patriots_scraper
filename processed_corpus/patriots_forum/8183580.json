TheJakeFroggy 3 points 21 hours ago I'm at the point where even if (and I mean IF ) the Trump administration were to actually go scorched earth and take down deep staters at large, I would still refuse to celebrate. In fact I'd just scream in frustration about it not having been done yesterday. They obviously won't do it, but even if they do, I don't give a fuck. I feel nothing anymore.

People knew it was a sham but no definitive proof. In 1952 Sam Smithwick, former deputy Sheriff of Jim Wells county, said he had information that would prove it was stolen (LBJ was the senate majority whip by then). He for some reason chose right before he could give that info to hang himself in his prison cell (he was in jail for murder). It didn't really gain steam until 1977 after LBJ's death.
