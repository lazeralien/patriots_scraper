That shouldn't disqualify you. Agree with the rest. permalink parent award report block reply Magma_Biscuit -3 points 4 hours ago I claim single and 0 dependents and still have to pay at the end of the year, people getting refund checks are mostly due to \u201ccredits\u201d that they qualify for which means others have to pay for those credits. It is not because you always pay to much. Just remember, if you qualify for credits and get a refund, other tax payers have to pay for those. Screwed up system really. permalink parent award report block reply mathteach314159 3 points 3 hours ago Most employers will put you in a tax bracket that favors paying more taxes than you will owe. So either you or your employer simply chose a tax rate that is lower than your actual tax bracket, and therefore you owe money at the end of the year. Thats all that means and you can\u2019t infer anything about anyone else based off of your individual experience. I get the feeling you are young and inexperienced with the tax cycle. Also, Its ok for the government to incentivize things like having children, being charitable, etc\u2026 permalink parent award report block reply RocksCanOnlyWait 1 points 4 hours ago The income tax paid to the government is based on what you elect to deduct from each paycheck. Most default it to deduct based only on your salary. When you add in other income, such as bank interest, you can owe money. If you didn't account for above standard deductions, then you end up over-paying. The EIC is one of the few handouts on that form. I would be fine with a lower rate and no deductions. permalink parent award report block reply IlhanOmarsFagBrother 1 points 1 hour ago How about if you are in the bottom 50% of earners who don't contribute to federal tax receipts at all anyway, you don't get shit. permalink parent award report block reply Thrilly 9 points 5 hours ago Just give every American a tax credit.

So either you or your employer simply chose a tax rate that is lower than your actual tax bracket, and therefore you owe money at the end of the year. Thats all that means and you can\u2019t infer anything about anyone else based off of your individual experience. I get the feeling you are young and inexperienced with the tax cycle. Also, Its ok for the government to incentivize things like having children, being charitable, etc\u2026 permalink parent award report block reply\nRocksCanOnlyWait 1 points 4 hours ago The income tax paid to the government is based on what you elect to deduct from each paycheck. Most default it to deduct based only on your salary. When you add in other income, such as bank interest, you can owe money. If you didn't account for above standard deductions, then you end up over-paying. The EIC is one of the few handouts on that form. I would be fine with a lower rate and no deductions. permalink parent award report block reply\nIlhanOmarsFagBrother 1 points 1 hour ago How about if you are in the bottom 50% of earners who don't contribute to federal tax receipts at all anyway, you don't get shit. permalink parent award report block reply\nThrilly 9 points 5 hours ago Just give every American a tax credit.

It makes sense to the establishment since they want that money pumped right back  into the economy (read stock market) and not saved or used to clear debt. Who will do that?
