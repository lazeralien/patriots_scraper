HONK HONK permalink award report block reply preferredfault 10 points 5 days ago They didn't \"rule\", they just blocked the court order temporarily. There's still legal fighting to be done. Of course it's obvious as to why Trump shouldn't fund food stamps: He legally can't. It's crazy how courts are telling Trump to pay for something that congress must first fund. But it's not just the Democrats doing this, it's the food companies lobbying like crazy, because without food stamps, they instantly lose a good 20% or more of all their business. That's a huge loss. At the same time, they can't raise prices, they'll be forced to lower them, especially when you consider perishables like milk and eggs and beef, basically anything that would expire in a month or a few months. They'll have to lower prices to keep up sales, and try to make up the difference through volume sales. permalink award report block reply FireTheCannons1776 2 points 4 days ago POTUS has no money.  How can POTUS be responsible to turn on any money, if it's not allocated by congress.  This is the reason that the money isn't flowing.  Those benefits were temporary and expired.  They are not backed by money or law. permalink parent award report block reply FlyCatcher94 2 points 4 days ago Coca-Cola company especially.  They are all in on poison for the poor. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower 5 points 5 days ago Based SCOTUS. Now don't cuck up on the tariffs even though if they nuke them I blame whatever Heritage Foundation retard told Trump that he can do whatever tariffs he wants by declaring a state of emergency or state of war with no precedents from any previous legislation or presidents backing up that claim. All the SCOTUS justices grilled the lawyer for Trump who didn't do a great job arguing for Trump at all, hoping that the LARP from the Heritage Foundation retard was going to win just based on copium. permalink award report block reply zooty 1 points 5 days ago I don't know about this specific case but I have been appalled at the competence we have seen from some of the lawyers in court at the national level.
