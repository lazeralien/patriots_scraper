For example, in the Arizona sector, ICE leadership in Phoenix is loathe to find, arrest and deport any illegals who haven\u2019t committed crimes in the US other than illegal entry. Constantly moaning that it\u2019s wrong to arrest and detain/deport \u201cnon crim\u201d aliens (those whose only crime is illegal entry itself).  This is one big reason deportations are lower than expected. It\u2019s why changes by DHS are needed in regional ICE leadership. permalink award report block reply PlantTrees 1 points 6 hours ago Guess they showed him the error of his ways :D permalink award report block reply\nyukondave 2 points 8 hours ago Now go protest in his home country and see how that goes.
