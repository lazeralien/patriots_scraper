They have 600 k students to do the job. permalink award report block reply rapskull 1 points 4 hours ago Asked Grok if DHS continued working during shutdown. Grok: Yes, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), continued processing H-1B1 petitions during the 2025 U.S. government shutdown. The shutdown lasted from October 1 to November 12, 2025, permalink award report block reply ThisTrainHasNoBrakes 1 points 2 hours ago I am THOROUGHLY against H1Bs.  It\u2019s anti-American shit. One \u201cDevil\u2019s advocate\u201d thing I\u2019ll say though:  I\u2019m also in AI automation and the post is accurate:  so many entry level jobs will be gone. So the thought I have is\u2026it\u2019s going to be these H1Bs that are gone then.  I don\u2019t agree with the policies, but I also have to ask if it serves someone to get into a truck driving career now.  I tell young people repeatedly not to be in these professions.  These jobs literally will not exist soon. So I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a silver lining that people are being steered away from these jobs now.  Not a cope, tired of hearing SAAAAR as much as the next guy. But we have a massive job loss that is coming. permalink award report block reply\nRealassman 2 points 1 hour ago They don\u2019t need H1bs.
