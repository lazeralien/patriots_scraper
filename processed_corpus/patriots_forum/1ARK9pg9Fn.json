A leadership that has an intimate relationship with the struggles of impoverished people. A man that has experienced the world of toil and hardship and has the empathy and compassion for the people still in it. This is akin to President Andrew Jackson. He was the only president to kill the central bank and eliminate our national debt. Because of him, 1776 was extended for another 100 years until the asswipe Woodrow Wilson. Whoever his wife is, is a personal choice, that requires a lot of different influences. Man is not as simple as to just classify them from race, ethnicity, and nationality. Would it have looked better for him to marry a white American super model? Sure. But he met this woman just like any other man and fell in love with her. I could care less that his wife is pajeet. He also met her years before the pajeets started to become a problem. Vance is a VP that I\u2019ve wanted since I was a young teenager, I\u2019ll take what I can get. He could have been another Mike pence who is married to an American white woman. Also, do you see how bad the hoeflation is in America with white women? permalink parent award report block reply CocaineNewsome 2 points 55 minutes ago I like that he understands but that will make it hurt so much worse if he does uniparty stuff anyway. Fuck Ukraine. They are some military industrial complex grifting. We go and save like $1B throwing people off food stamps, maybe we cut 40B from Ukraine.. but those are drops in a bucket. Where is the rest? The real structural stuff. The time for just saying what we wanna hear has run out. That's my gripe. permalink parent award report block reply BigMikesChef 2 points 37 minutes ago They've let us down on everything thus far, why would that change? permalink parent award report block reply BigMikesChef 2 points 38 minutes ago The issue isn't her race. She's a democrat and a pagan. Pretty terrible influence to have in your leader's house. His next greatest influence is Thiel...not good omens. permalink parent award report block reply NonbinaryPotatohead 1 points 29 minutes ago He didn't write his book btw, its manufactured permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -16 points 2 hours ago Racist incel permalink parent award report block reply TPMJB 7 points 2 hours ago Do you think your words have power over us, golem? permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -13 points 1 hour ago Yes you fucking loser. permalink parent award report block reply TPMJB 4 points 1 hour ago I make more than you and your AIPAC/JIDF bucks.

I'm 80% sure we know what we are getting and if anything he is holding back being more MAGA for the sake of appearing less chaotic than Trump when 2028 rolls around. He really seems like someone who after enough beers would be hosting an impromptu episode of InfoWars at the bar. permalink parent award report block reply IvotedforTrumptwice 4 points 1 hour ago If he\u2019s not MAGA, then he\u2019s an incredible actor and has done a great job of covering up and making up his true history. permalink parent award report block reply Imnotnorm 0 points 29 minutes ago Yes those things are true unfortunately.
