Have been from day one.  We are hurting.  We are still significantly financially behind where we were 5 years ago ago.  Number one reason is H1B visa.  My husband had to take  30% pay cut to find a job after he was laid off.

He did some minor reforms that don't really change anything. permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 2 points 2 days ago Why are you lying like a faggot. Go back to Reddit where you belong. permalink parent award report block reply HeavyMetalPatriot 6 points 3 days ago Trump is bizarrely beholden to Silicon Valley. They hate him, yet he does their bidding. But I'm super duper sure JD Pajeet Vance will totally stop the invasion. permalink award report block reply RINOssuck 3 points 2 days ago I have seen this same quote from several different posters. This is MAGA dividing bullshit. permalink award report block reply greatpumpkin 2 points 2 days ago You're not the only one wondering that, friend. permalink award report block reply SanityGumby 2 points 2 days ago I see you are mentally retarded and need to be deported. They are doing something about H1b you fucking mental midget. There are investigations against nearly 200 companies for H1b fraud. They added expenses to reduce h1bs. Next the H1b cap will continue to decline. They are revoking thousands and thousands and thousands of immigration visas. Just because you are low iq doesn\u2019t mean anything isn\u2019t being done and if they did what you\u2019re mental midget negroid iq wanted you would destroy the entire global economy. permalink award report block reply barwhack 1 points 2 days ago Trump isn't MAGA?
