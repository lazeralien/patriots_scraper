Will there be free Healthcare for illegals now? permalink award report block reply SanityGumby 23 points 2 days ago No. Democrats gained literally 0 in this deal. It's the same as the original CR. Anything CNN had in their initial bullet lists of the deal were already going to be happening anyway. There was already going to be negotiation on Obamacare. There already was going to be funding through January for SNAP...because it's in the funding of the original CR. No illegal healthcare. No Obamacare funding beyond what remains with the ending of subsidies. permalink parent award report block reply Zskills 15 points 2 days ago Democrats gained literally 0 in this deal They got a bunch of their deepstate leeches re-hired with back pay permalink parent award report block reply SanityGumby 11 points 2 days ago No, they got nothing. Those people wouldn't have been let go if they just signed the original CR. All they did is not lose.

Democrats will codify it into law once they regain government control in 2028 or 2030 and then republicans will defend it because the democrats are the real racists.  The GOP exists solely to enforce with rigor that which the radical left has perpetrated on our government and culture. permalink parent award report block reply DeportThemAllForever -1 points 2 days ago It\u2019s Biden spend continues, no changes. So Republicans at the end continue Biden budget. permalink parent award report block reply CruzControl 13 points 2 days ago It for real is. They are signing the Red House CR as is.\nThe filibuster heat was getting too hot for them to handle and they found dems that were not up for re-election in 2026. Thune did give them one thing which was a lot less than what we were worrying about. A separate vote on the ACA subsidies in December - will need 51 to pass as it is filibuster proof. Dems are going to try and pin the rise in ACA premiums on the GOP/Trump. permalink award report block reply MehNahMehNah 4 points 2 days ago Is this a scenario where JD may have to come in to cast a deciding vote? Or is it the other house? Obama care needs to be gutted and made pointless. If the US persists in providing some national federally funded 'healthcare' it needs to be tied to reform of all the supporting (or supported) systems. Insurance companies out of control. Big Pharma. Hospital billing and accounting practices. Medical certifications and oversight. permalink parent award report block reply datraceman 7 points 2 days ago The problem is once Obamacare passed they had a small window to get rid of it and fucking John McCain ruined it. Unless Republicans come up with actual legislation to replace Obamacare with something sensible we are stuck with it because once socialism leaks into your government, you can't get rid of it. See all our dumbass welfare policies. Social Security, welfare, SNAP, etc. Once Obamacare wasn't repealed soon after it passed, we were screwed. Now, it's how do you contain it and limit it. permalink parent award report block reply Glory-Unto-God 2 points 2 days ago Gutless permalink parent award report block reply TheThreeSeashells -1 points 2 days ago Unless Republicans come up with actual legislation to replace Obamacare with something sensible Rand Paul handed President Trump a perfect plan in his first term and it was completely ignored.  It doesn't even require them to go through the process of repealing Obamacare.  It simply allows credit unions and other membership organizations to offer healthcare to their members, giving them the ability to negotiate lower rates because they would have numbers on their side. This would offer a more affordable option than Obamacare which in theory could likely choke Obamacare to death over time.  More importantly, it opens healthcare to the free market and creates actual competition.  Not just the \"we're jacking up your rates again and there's nothing you can do about it\" situation we have right now. If only President Trump got over his petty squabbling with Rand, stopped listening to his advisors who have no plan, and just embraced Rand's plan, we would actually have a solution.  The anti-Rand crowd here needs to do the same.  If you want to bitch and moan about his stance on tariffs, fine.  But why throw out a great idea because you disagree on him regarding other issues?  That's moronic.

Mad about the shutdown and now mad about it ending. permalink award report block reply TheThreeSeashells 5 points 2 days ago They were mad about it starting because their controllers told them to be mad.  They're mad about it ending for the same reason and because they're being told they got nothing out of it.  None of them will be able to actually tell you a legitimate reason why they were mad about either one. permalink parent award report block reply newuser8 2 points 2 days ago Firmware OTA updates dictate their every move permalink parent award report block reply Trubs 2 points 2 days ago You'd think they'd be more upset about their mutilated genitalia. permalink parent award report block reply YaharaRiver 0 points 2 days ago It\u2019s funny as hell.

None of them would have been laid off if the CR passed originally. And the only promise is they won't be fired again until after January. A promise. Not law. It was unlikely Trump was going to do mass firings right before Thanksgiving and Christmas. permalink parent award report block reply Diversityhire 4 points 2 days ago Boo, was hoping we make it through the holidays permalink award report block reply pococurante 1 points 2 days ago I regret to inform you that we can't stop winning permalink parent award report block reply clownworld30330 4 points 2 days ago No, it\u2019s the uniparty\u2019s victory.

Immediate end to their federal unemployment checks! AND if an employee is reinstated and receives back pay for the period they were laid off, they are required to repay the unemployment compensation (UC) benefits they received during that same period! Not the \u201cbig win\u201d the dems think.  Now get to work, bitches, there\u2019s two months of pile-up on your desk!! permalink parent award report block reply TheThreeSeashells 1 points 2 days ago there\u2019s two months of pile-up on your desk!! Do you actually think they're going to work their asses off to catch up?  All that means is there will now be a permanent two month delay built-in to whatever it is they do. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 2 days ago If you know anyone on EBT, SNAP or Medicaid who couldn't get their monthly benefits, you should show them that lefty Democrats are protesting their welfare benefits.  Show the that Democrats would rather feed illegals aliens, house illegal aliens and give healthcare to illegal aliens than to them.  Show them how unreliable \"compassionate\" Dems are.  Tell them that Dems buy votes to enrich themselves and their families.  They don't care about impoverished Americans.  They think impoverished Americans are trash. permalink award report block reply ParticleCannon 3 points 2 days ago Protest that its shut down.  Protest that it ends. Do these people have jobs or are they just constant Protest temps? permalink award report block reply preferredfault 3 points 2 days ago It's all pre-planned theater, because Schumer needed a way out while still voting against it. Senator Kennedy predicted weeks ago that this is exactly what was going to happen. Trump should throw a hail mary and veto it anyways then demand even more concessions from Democrats.

Those are over, so time for the government to open and the propaganda machine to kick in. permalink award report block reply\nOmegaBird 1 points 2 days ago Fuck Demoncrats.

They tried to force everyone to have health insurance and wanted to make it illegal to breathe without it. When the government forces you to buy into corporate scams on a large scale that's how you know the US is also a corporation.\nThe new enterprise. \"Annuit Coeptis...Novos Ordo Seclorum.\" Not all is doomed. The faster we can get enough true believing Americans in these seats we can get rid of all this bullshit.

Everyone knows that this type of \"caving\" was done via leadership selecting those that either needed to be seen as compromising -or- those that are so secure that the blowback from their base could be weathered. It's all theater, and frankly the WWF does it better.  (And yes, I know it's the WWE, but fuck forced renaming). permalink award report block reply\nkeeman 0 points 2 days ago Yes.  America loses.
