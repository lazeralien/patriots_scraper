I could not in good conscience support a resolution that creates a self-indulgent legal provision for certain senators to enrich themselves by suing the Justice Department using taxpayer dollars. There is no reason the House should have been forced to eat this garbage to end the Schumer Shutdown. Greg Steube's reasons permalink award report block reply JLoonacy 6 points 12 hours ago These are absolutely valid reasons. The House has \"promised\" (read: offered their word which has absolutely no value) to pass separate legislation after reopening the government that will specifically repeal this portion of the CR.
