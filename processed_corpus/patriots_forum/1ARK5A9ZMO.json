This also ensures SNAP and VA are funded until the end of the year and requires a vote on the ACA stuff before the end of this year. permalink parent award report block reply Coprolite 11 points 3 days ago Keep it shut down. permalink award report block reply Moose_Antlers 7 points 3 days ago If I understand this correctly, it's a clean CR. CR = continuing resolution. The bill authorizes current Biden era spending levels to continue into December to allow more time to negotiate. Speaker Johnson has offered this since September. It's been sitting in the Senate waiting for Schumer to ok it this long. ------ How this will work ------ This will work the same way it does every damn year we do this. Dems are going to hold out until Christmas when everyone's feeling generous and wants to be home with their families. Then Schumer's going to make wild demands and hold the government hostage and tell them they can't celebrate Christmas until they vote. The Republicans will cave and Dems get to play Santa Claus to illegals once again with our money because the GOP is too afraid to FIGHT. If the GOP decides to show some spine, the best we'll get at the end of that stunt is another CR to get us to March, and we'll do the same game of chicken again, this time with tax season looming and businesses screaming demanding certainty in the laws so they can plan their budgets. Then the donors get involved in the pressure campaign. And usually the GOP will cave because they're too afraid to FIGHT. permalink award report block reply victory2024 9 points 3 days ago \"Biden era spending levels\" -- so funding illegals will continue? permalink parent award report block reply KekistanPM 4 points 3 days ago If congressmen and senators didn't get paid during a shutdown, you can be sure the government would be open right now. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous -2 points 3 days ago The GOP isn't afraid. This is the exact result AIPAC wants, because a functional independent USA lead by its own citizens success is dangerous to their designs permalink parent award report block reply Spacemonkey 5 points 3 days ago Just my opinion here but any politician who even suggests legislation that would give illegal aliens anything other than a swift boot up their asses out of our country should immediately be tried for treason and if found guilty carted outside and hanged publicly that goes for Republicans as well as democrats. permalink award report block reply Hanging_Chad 4 points 3 days ago why is this causing crypto to go up? \ud83d\udcc8 permalink award report block reply BreakingCNN 4 points 3 days ago What kind of a tulip bulb is this crypto?

If they can\u2019t get that over the line - how on earth does the senate think it will pass the real spending bills if they even slow the growth of spending (under baseline budgeting even holding spending to the same amount is a massive cut - according to dc retard accounting).

Any school receiving federal money for meals that cannot show that all children come from citizen households by the end of the month stops getting money December 1st. Any bank that cannot show that all account holders have legal status in the US by the end of the month are red-lined and removed from FDIC programs on December 1st. All lenders who cannot prove that a creditor in collection is a US citizen by the end of the month will be barred from seeking relief in federal court. All states that do not provide full SNAP accounting by the end of the month lose all SNAP payments. All states that do not provide full commercial and non-commercial driver's licenses audit by the end of the month lose all federal highway matching funds. Merry Christmas America.

CR = continuing resolution. The bill authorizes current Biden era spending levels to continue into December to allow more time to negotiate. Speaker Johnson has offered this since September. It's been sitting in the Senate waiting for Schumer to ok it this long. ------ How this will work ------ This will work the same way it does every damn year we do this. Dems are going to hold out until Christmas when everyone's feeling generous and wants to be home with their families. Then Schumer's going to make wild demands and hold the government hostage and tell them they can't celebrate Christmas until they vote. The Republicans will cave and Dems get to play Santa Claus to illegals once again with our money because the GOP is too afraid to FIGHT. If the GOP decides to show some spine, the best we'll get at the end of that stunt is another CR to get us to March, and we'll do the same game of chicken again, this time with tax season looming and businesses screaming demanding certainty in the laws so they can plan their budgets. Then the donors get involved in the pressure campaign. And usually the GOP will cave because they're too afraid to FIGHT. permalink award report block reply victory2024 9 points 3 days ago \"Biden era spending levels\" -- so funding illegals will continue? permalink parent award report block reply KekistanPM 4 points 3 days ago If congressmen and senators didn't get paid during a shutdown, you can be sure the government would be open right now. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous -2 points 3 days ago The GOP isn't afraid.
