The difference, which he doesn't appreciate because he is young, is that all of that worked best in a stable high trust society. The off shoring, the financialization/looting, the normalization of physical, mental and moral poisons (drugs, porn, DEI) have all undermined the foundations of a society that could care for itself through churches. I'm not saying it can't be done or shouldn't be done. It's that it's a big problem and will require additional structural changes in the economy/society. permalink award report block reply 19American62Woman 10 points 12 hours ago My daughter and I used to visit different churches.

Sermons are speeches in support of socialism and immigration. They will turn your stomach. The church I grew up in now is Spanish speaking. Only one mass is English, 5 pm on Saturday. The local ecumenical church in my neighborhood supports BLM, trans rights, and public housing zoning changes. When saying \u201cgo back to church\u201d, spend some time finding the right one.
