He, like most boomers, don't really give a fuck that the younger generations can't afford homes or to start families.

The goal is to have appreciating profits in short term as there are quarterly reports. One easy way to get there is to hire H1b. We all cheer when our 401k portfolio shows double digit gains. Can only happen with technology change that replaces workers or getting slave labor. You get AI and H1b replacing workers. My 401 K has healthy gains though. Yaay permalink parent award report block reply Klown_Kutz 10 points 3 hours ago It's not that boomers don't give a fuck.  What we have is what they want.  The whole mindset of that awful generation is that they don't want anyone else to have what they did. permalink parent award report block reply Pissonit 9 points 3 hours ago So your saying a boomer wouldn't want their kids to succeed in life, have a good job, start a family, buy their own home instead of having to live with their parents the rest of their lives....is that what boomers want? permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 12 points 2 hours ago This is correct, but you're off at the end. The vast majority of boomers want their kids to take care of them rather than take care of their kids. They don't want their kids to live with them.  That would mean taking care of them. They simply don't lift a finger to help their kids get ahead. They have no concept of legacy or passing things down to the next generation. They sit in positions at businesses until they are forced out instead of getting out of the way. They spend their money on toys and vacations instead of setting up trust funds. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

It\u2019s the boomer politicians that are greedy and self absorbed. It\u2019s also the location where they are.

That one reporter was front and centre taking pictures of President Trump's head in burst mode and caught the bullet. They wanted images of President Trump's head exploding like Charlie Kirk's neck, broadcast all around the world for everyone to see what happens when you oppose them. And now he's just going to pull the punch? It's simply not a credible version of events. I don't believe President Trump has turned on MAGA. I could believe he's been threatened and somehow brought into submission, but I don't believe it's betrayal. I don't think he would want MAGA to blindly follow him back into the globalist flock, he would want MAGA to stick to its principles and make America great again, with or without him. permalink parent award report block reply load 11 more comments...

When in reality, they are letting them sit empty as justification to bring in H1B workers who work for half the price of Americans. permalink award report block reply bluewhiteandred 2 points 2 hours ago \"scam and scandal\" well, idk if I would describe it like that, but let's break down what's happening these jobs can be done for cheaper by non-Americans. So the companies want to save a buck by either importing cheaper labor or offshoring operations to somewhere else. This is felt to be a win-win for the company that saves costs on labor and for the laborer from another country that makes more money than the would otherwise. It can also be a win for us if it enables us to do other work for higher pay But then some problems come in: if they import the labor like with h1bs, they're also importing those cultures and politics. We're kind of coming to an agreement that doesn't work very well Offshoring the jobs also hasn't necessarily worked since those jobs weren't necessarily replaced with higher paying jobs; greedy corps simply pocketed the money that would have otherwise been paid \"more\" to middle class working Americans Also, you can create this highly dependent global economic situation, where say the third world could grow all our food while the 1st world builds computers and machines to help them grow it. However, if they decided they didn't want to sell us food that we depend on them for (for example), then we would have a national security issue of getting access to food. So, there probably needs to be a balance and backup plans when we offshore jobs (if we're going to do so) if trades don't work out. Alternatively people could be poorer but more self-sufficient and self-sufficient as a country / nation. So Trump is getting lost in some of these economic considerations, either he needs to bring about better jobs for the manufacturing jobs that get outsourced, or to maybe discourage companies from sending jobs overseas at something of a loss to their \"bottom line\" (it will probably cost more in labor) edit: so a \"profits first\" policy, not necessarily a scam or scandal so much as not \"america first\" edit 2: so another way some economic pull could be exerted is by identifying companies that make use of h1bs and organizing boycotts or advertising their company policies for people to make a stir about permalink award report block reply Wiggle-Hard 2 points 1 hour ago Reality time The technology and warehousing industries have seen the most layoffs, largely driven by AI integration, cost-cutting, and shifting consumer demand.

Yet here we are. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 1 points 28 minutes ago I can't imagine thinking \"I'm going to just go easy on the people who tried to have me publicly shot.\" The news all showed up for that speech. That one reporter was front and centre taking pictures of President Trump's head in burst mode and caught the bullet. They wanted images of President Trump's head exploding like Charlie Kirk's neck, broadcast all around the world for everyone to see what happens when you oppose them. And now he's just going to pull the punch? It's simply not a credible version of events. I don't believe President Trump has turned on MAGA. I could believe he's been threatened and somehow brought into submission, but I don't believe it's betrayal. I don't think he would want MAGA to blindly follow him back into the globalist flock, he would want MAGA to stick to its principles and make America great again, with or without him. permalink parent award report block reply\nWexit-Delecto 1 points 28 minutes ago I can't imagine thinking \"I'm going to just go easy on the people who tried to have me publicly shot.\" The news all showed up for that speech.

However, this is maybe 25-30% of the problem. Companies are 100% using jeets to suppress wages.

So the companies want to save a buck by either importing cheaper labor or offshoring operations to somewhere else. This is felt to be a win-win for the company that saves costs on labor and for the laborer from another country that makes more money than the would otherwise. It can also be a win for us if it enables us to do other work for higher pay But then some problems come in: if they import the labor like with h1bs, they're also importing those cultures and politics. We're kind of coming to an agreement that doesn't work very well Offshoring the jobs also hasn't necessarily worked since those jobs weren't necessarily replaced with higher paying jobs; greedy corps simply pocketed the money that would have otherwise been paid \"more\" to middle class working Americans Also, you can create this highly dependent global economic situation, where say the third world could grow all our food while the 1st world builds computers and machines to help them grow it. However, if they decided they didn't want to sell us food that we depend on them for (for example), then we would have a national security issue of getting access to food. So, there probably needs to be a balance and backup plans when we offshore jobs (if we're going to do so) if trades don't work out. Alternatively people could be poorer but more self-sufficient and self-sufficient as a country / nation. So Trump is getting lost in some of these economic considerations, either he needs to bring about better jobs for the manufacturing jobs that get outsourced, or to maybe discourage companies from sending jobs overseas at something of a loss to their \"bottom line\" (it will probably cost more in labor) edit: so a \"profits first\" policy, not necessarily a scam or scandal so much as not \"america first\" edit 2: so another way some economic pull could be exerted is by identifying companies that make use of h1bs and organizing boycotts or advertising their company policies for people to make a stir about permalink award report block reply\nWiggle-Hard 2 points 1 hour ago Reality time The technology and warehousing industries have seen the most layoffs, largely driven by AI integration, cost-cutting, and shifting consumer demand.

For the year 2025, tech firms have announced over 141,000 job cuts.\nWarehousing: This industry had the highest number of layoffs in a single month (October 2025) and has seen a dramatic increase in year-to-date job cuts compared to 2024.\nRetail: This sector is still facing pressure due to shifting consumer habits, rising costs, and ongoing store closures. Year-to-date job cuts are up significantly from the previous year.\nGovernment: This sector has announced the most layoffs year-to-date, exceeding the total for the entire year of 2024.\nServices: The services sector, which includes companies providing support services, has also seen an increase in job cuts compared to 2024.\nDriving factors for layoffs\nAI integration: The adoption of AI is a major factor, as companies restructure to take advantage of new efficiencies.\nCost-cutting and efficiency: Companies are tightening their belts in response to rising costs and softer consumer and corporate spending.\nShifting demand and store closures: The retail sector, in particular, is navigating changing consumer habits, leading to store closures and job cuts. permalink award report block reply\nmohel 2 points 2 hours ago Why is everything, the government does, a scam? permalink award report block reply\nGeneticsGuy 1 points 31 minutes ago Software dev here.
