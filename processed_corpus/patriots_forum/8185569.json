You can't just arrest every brown person you see, the way that Eisenhower did. There are tens of millions of Hispanics that are US citizens today. That was not the case back in the days of Operation Wetback. The best thing we can do is push Trump to arrest CEO's for hiring illegals.

Geeze this is getting bad. permalink award report block reply Repentnow -4 points 6 hours ago Both is the correct answer. The 50 year mortgage hate is retarded. It just adds an additional option. You can still get what ever length mortgage you want. If you take a 50 year mortgage and make the same payment as a 15 year mortgage, you'll be paid off in 15 years with the exact same interest paid. The advantage of the 50yr is your minimum payment is much lower compared to a 15yr, so if you hit a financial snag anywhere during that 15 years, you could drop back to the lower minimum payment for a little while. permalink award report block reply Parhelion12 5 points 6 hours ago Oh cmon. That's just intellectually dishonest. Combing 50 year mtgs with the widespread financial illiteracy is an AUTOMATIC wealth transfer. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 5 hours ago So when the 30 year mortgages were created, a wealth transfer happened? Japan and Switzerland offer 50 year mortgages.  Sweden has no limit and the average is 140 years. Japan has previously offered generational 100 year mortgages. Let me know how they're doing compared to the US. Hint: the problem might be darker and have nothing to do with the mortgage term length. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 5 hours ago If some people are too stupid to understand how mortgage and interest work, then they deserve whatever financial disaster befalls them.

Dave Ramsey has said if you can't obtain a 15 year mortgage go with a 30 and just pay it off in 15 years. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 5 hours ago I know many that have used this. The going strategy was to base it on interest.  High interest, get the higher year mortgage and when interest drops, refi for the 10 or 15 year mortgage. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 1 points 5 hours ago This was very common in the 80s with interest sky high. permalink parent award report block reply berserkerbarrage -7 points 6 hours ago Then  don't take out a 50 year mortgage. They also said that they were working on making 5 and 15 year mortgages more available. Nobody is forcing you to do anything you don't want to, but other people will appreciate the options. We're deporting people as fast as legally possible and at much higher rates than previous administrations (turnaways =/= deportations). If it's not fast enough then maybe you should focus more on electing MAGA candidates to change the law and less on trying to help open borders Democrats win. For the anti-Trump trolls that will inevitably bot the shit out of this thread. permalink award report block reply Mamapedia 6 points 6 hours ago Every person who has legitimate criticisms of Trump's words and actions is not an anti-Trump troll.

You may find that your blinders serve the left very well in the not so distant future. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut -1 points 5 hours ago Complaining about an option you dont have to take while hes trying to do nearly everything else he ran on is not legitimate criticism, sorry if you dont like that. The only, and I mean only, legitimate criticism ive seen of him lately is that the ingrham interview could have been alot better, and he doesnt seem to be dooming like everyone else so hes trying to focus on things hes doing right now. Is he a little out of touch in it, yeah, but if everyone is going to go full chicken little over an interview that wasnt great, MAGA deserves to lose far more than just the midterms. The democrats were loyal to biden for 4 years no matter what he did and he was a literal potato. MAGA is just fickle people who want magic wands to fix everything immediately apparently because the media plays into your attitudes, knowing you'll end up self destructing just like the democrats are doing. Only they'll be able to pull together in elections, because they are at least unified in their hatred of you. So dont forget to adjust your own blinders while acting smug. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... berserkerbarrage -4 points 6 hours ago Where is the legitimate criticism? It's also just a fact that this site is being botted and brigaded by Nick Fuentes trolls. If you can't explain why offering people more mortgage options (on both ends of the spectrum) is a bad thing then it's not a legitimate criticism. If you're blaming Trump for the fact that more people aren't being deported (despite him deporting people as fast as legally possible), that's not legitimate criticism. If you're blaming Trump for high beef prices but you can't say how or why he's responsible for high beef prices, that's not a legitimate criticism. permalink parent award report block reply Mamapedia 1 points 6 hours ago Both exist.  You only appear willing to acknowledge the trolling.  Am I to understand that one must be 100% pro Israel and pro-corporate to be MAGA?  There are pressing domestic issues that should come first, and Trump seems to be otherwise engaged at this point, given what he has said about h1b's and his international focus.  I have to say that the ballroom business and the corporate love fest is awful for optics and the morale of those who are looking to Trump for economic relief, and I'm not talking about welfare recipients, but working people who keep falling farther behind despite their efforts.  If you don't see that and acknowledge the threat that it is, you must live in pretty rarified circumstances.

H1B workers are less than 3% of the tech industry, and a fraction of a percentage of the overall work force. And we've always accepted foreign students, which account for roughly 5% of students.

You can still get what ever length mortgage you want. If you take a 50 year mortgage and make the same payment as a 15 year mortgage, you'll be paid off in 15 years with the exact same interest paid. The advantage of the 50yr is your minimum payment is much lower compared to a 15yr, so if you hit a financial snag anywhere during that 15 years, you could drop back to the lower minimum payment for a little while. permalink award report block reply Parhelion12 5 points 6 hours ago Oh cmon.

Dave Ramsey has said if you can't obtain a 15 year mortgage go with a 30 and just pay it off in 15 years. permalink parent award report block reply FatigueIsReal 3 points 5 hours ago I know many that have used this. The going strategy was to base it on interest.  High interest, get the higher year mortgage and when interest drops, refi for the 10 or 15 year mortgage. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 1 points 5 hours ago This was very common in the 80s with interest sky high. permalink parent award report block reply\nFatigueIsReal 3 points 5 hours ago I know many that have used this.

They also said that they were working on making 5 and 15 year mortgages more available. Nobody is forcing you to do anything you don't want to, but other people will appreciate the options. We're deporting people as fast as legally possible and at much higher rates than previous administrations (turnaways =/= deportations). If it's not fast enough then maybe you should focus more on electing MAGA candidates to change the law and less on trying to help open borders Democrats win. For the anti-Trump trolls that will inevitably bot the shit out of this thread. permalink award report block reply Mamapedia 6 points 6 hours ago Every person who has legitimate criticisms of Trump's words and actions is not an anti-Trump troll.

The democrats were loyal to biden for 4 years no matter what he did and he was a literal potato. MAGA is just fickle people who want magic wands to fix everything immediately apparently because the media plays into your attitudes, knowing you'll end up self destructing just like the democrats are doing.
