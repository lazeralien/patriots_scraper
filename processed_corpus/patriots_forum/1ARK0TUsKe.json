We still managed to have some relatively decent times after that as the various socialist mechanisms were installed over the following several decades and we continued prospering off the previous free society, but it was all over as soon as the Federal Reserve and progressive income tax were imposed. There's a reason both of those are listed in Marx's 10 Core Planks of Communism. They're the foundation for everything else. And that's exactly why those two things should be the first to go. Just rip the foundation out at the roots and the house of cards leftism is built on will crumble. permalink parent award report block reply NoMaskNoMaster 2 points 7 days ago Its strange we dont hear more about the resistance to such a change.

Meanwhile... New York City residents face a multi-layered tax system that includes state, city, and local levies. The city imposes its own income tax on top of New York State taxes, with rates ranging from 3.078% to 3.876% depending on income level and filing status, resulting in combined state and city income tax rates between 7.078% and 14.776% for top earners. New York State itself has nine progressive income tax brackets, from 4% to 10.9%. Sales taxes in New York City are among the highest in the nation, with a total rate of 8.875%, including a 0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District charge.\nProperty taxes in New York City have an average effective rate of 0.91% of property value, though this is due to the taxable value being set at only 6% of market value for most residential properties. The city\u2019s property tax is a major revenue source, projected to generate $24 billion in fiscal year 2017 and continuing to grow due to rising real estate values. Additionally, residents pay a 25.68 cents per gallon gas tax and a $4.35 per pack cigarette excise tax, with an additional $1.50 per pack in New York City. permalink award report block reply tlorsung 1 points 7 days ago Hay Now!  It is possible that Mamdani will be a mayor that helps NYC citizens so much that the quality of life is increased and cost of living decreases!!

The filth and corruption is off the hook bad so I don't blame anyone for holding their nose and running away.. I guess President Trump said he would have run for mayor but he was a bit too busy being President at this time.. permalink parent award report block reply lefty295 1 points 7 days ago A 2015 era Trump without the political baggage of being President would likely have been able to win that three way race imo, with his name recognition and populist policies. Probably not after TDS is all over nyc now. permalink parent award report block reply KungPaoMcChicken 1 points 7 days ago To be honest, I don't think the Mayor can really do much. He can't change taxes, that's a state thing. I doubt he can provide free buses. I think people are worried too much. permalink award report block reply SenorTrumper OP 1 points 7 days ago But-but-but, he promised a ton of free shit! permalink parent award report block reply KungPaoMcChicken 1 points 7 days ago He said he will increase taxes (he can't, that's state) and make buses free (he can't because there is no money to pay for it). The mayor has jack shit power over anything. permalink parent award report block reply SenorTrumper OP 1 points 7 days ago None of that matters! HE PROMISED US! permalink parent award report block reply KungPaoMcChicken 1 points 7 days ago It doesn't matter what he said, he's incapable of delivering. Check it out. The mayor has no control over the state, the state decides taxes. He has no way to generate the revenue. Also, how do the buses operate? Is it privatised? If he's promising to cover the costs, then what's to stop the bus operators deliberately increasing costs because this dude is promising pay. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

Meanwhile... New York City residents face a multi-layered tax system that includes state, city, and local levies. The city imposes its own income tax on top of New York State taxes, with rates ranging from 3.078% to 3.876% depending on income level and filing status, resulting in combined state and city income tax rates between 7.078% and 14.776% for top earners. New York State itself has nine progressive income tax brackets, from 4% to 10.9%. Sales taxes in New York City are among the highest in the nation, with a total rate of 8.875%, including a 0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District charge.\nProperty taxes in New York City have an average effective rate of 0.91% of property value, though this is due to the taxable value being set at only 6% of market value for most residential properties. The city\u2019s property tax is a major revenue source, projected to generate $24 billion in fiscal year 2017 and continuing to grow due to rising real estate values. Additionally, residents pay a 25.68 cents per gallon gas tax and a $4.35 per pack cigarette excise tax, with an additional $1.50 per pack in New York City. permalink award report block reply\ntlorsung 1 points 7 days ago Hay Now!
