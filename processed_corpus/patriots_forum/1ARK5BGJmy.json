If you're a South American drug cartel, you don't need a large presence in Kauai of all places. permalink parent award report block reply boomerbutnotOKBoomer 13 points 3 days ago And you'd be pretty easy to spot. Plus, pretty much everyone is related. I'm related to 1/3 of Kauai and 1/2 of Maui. Not something you'd readily realize if you are going there to hide out. Of interest, about 30 years ago there was a WTO or similar conference in Honolulu. Some troublemakers from Quebec flew in to protest. They thought everyone hated the police because they did. But at that time, a huge percentage of families had at least one law enforcement type in their family. So the dumbasses cooked up this idea they would fill all the fire extinguishers in the convention center with gasoline, and then set small fires all through the center. They backed up their van in the docking area of the Convention center and stole dozens of fire extinguishers. They emptied them and then took them to a nearby gas station. The kids working there were ALL relatives of cops. So they called it in and the jackasses were arrested. permalink parent award report block reply boomerbutnotOKBoomer 6 points 3 days ago OH - one more. Another couple of asswipes from this stellar group decided to go out to the country and buy some pig shit. Their plan was to set it on fire and throw it on the cops and security details of the visiting dignitaries. Only problem is they were chatty cathies. The asswipes, again, believed everyone hates cops like they do. So they go out to the pig farms and try to buy pig shit. Got the shit beat out of them instead. Cops get called and the pig farmers tell them, \"We dunno. Dese bruddas wen come out heah and start fightin' wid each uddah. We stayed out of it. No care if dey kill each uddah.\" It was the stuff of legends for years to come.

That is my ULTRA conservative estimate based on common sense, using my eyes, and using my ears listening to the media tell us we have 12,000,000 illegals since Jimmy Carter was slingin\u2019 peanuts. If there were 12,000,000 illegals in America in 1980, and they are coming in and growing at the same percentage rate as inflation, how many are in America today? Let\u2019s calculate carefully step-by-step. \u2e3b Establish assumptions\n\u2022\tStarting number (1980): 12,000,000\n\u2022\tGrowth rate: same as inflation\n\u2022\tTime span: 1980 \u2192 2025 = 45 years We need an average annual inflation rate over that period. The U.S. inflation rate has varied, but the average CPI inflation from 1980\u20132025 is about 3.2% per year (based on long-term Bureau of Labor Statistics data). \u2e3b Use the compound growth formula N = N_0 \\times (1 + r)^t\nWhere:\n\u2022\tN_0 = 12,000,000\n\u2022\tr = 0.032 (3.2%)\n\u2022\tt = 45 \u2e3b Compute precisely\n(1.032)^{45} = e^{45 \\times \\ln(1.032)} \\approx e^{45 \\times 0.0315} \\approx e^{1.4175} \\approx 4.13\nThen:\n12,000,000 \\times 4.13 = 49,560,000 \u2e3b \u2705 Final Answer:\nIf the number of illegal immigrants grew at the same rate as inflation (\u22483.2% annually),\nthere would be about 50 million in America today (in 2025).
