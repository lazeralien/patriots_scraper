Gnometard 8 points 1 day ago Yep, but we're more focused on what social media tells us to look at... which always seems to align with causing more division and anger among the population. If not for social media, 80% of the country would be united. At the root, most people see the same problems but the influence of social media won't let people recognize that using divisive framing and rhetoric to prevent folks from seeing it. In 2016, before I stopped using everything but the Donald then PDW, I had a 10x gilded comment showing how Bernie Sanders and Trump both had the SAME problems they wanted to address. I broke it down bullet by bullet from each campaign website. Then when Bernie joined the black eye club and the dems screwed Bernie voters with polling places and other similar issues (the same shit they try to do with Republicans or anyone not on the left),  Bernie bros became Trump supporters. It was still a divisive time, but social media wasn't as prominent so there were still a lot of people able to think. Nobody can remember that far back because their attention span has been cut down through years of constant shifting of focus. People supporting the removal of filibuster don't even remember when democrats wanted that not too long ago.... and they can't think ahead to what would happen if it's removed and democrats win more seats (the left votes more than the right, only for Trump does that change) permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 1 points 1 day ago It's not that the left votes more than the right per se.  It's that for nearly a century, the Dem vote was a reliable turnout.  General to General, primary to primary, mid-term to mid-term, the vote numbers for Dem stayed pretty much the same except due to a rise in population.   For almost a century, big turnouts meant the Dems had an advantage because big turnouts meant more uninformed and welfare recipients were voting. For almost a century, Republican voter turnout varied widely.   Here's a startling fact:  If McCain had as many Republican voters turn out as George W Bush did in 2004, McCain would have won.   If Romney had as many Republicans turn out to vote as McCain did, Romney would have won.   Obama is the first president to win re-election with substantially fewer votes than he did when he was first elected.  Also in 2012, down ballot races went badly for Democrats.  That should have been a warning sign for them. In the Trump era, in the movement to reshape the Republican party, the biggest problem we have is Republicans, conservatives, independents and libertarians not showing up at the polls.   For the last couple of elections (looking at what is real 2020 election data, not the fake stuff from the stolen states), high voter turnout for the first time is favoring Republicans and specifically MAGA candidates. The Republican vote, which is the MAGA vote, has become even more unreliable.  If MAGA shows up, MAGA wins but MAGA doesn't always show up to vote.  While GOPe has never focused on Get Out The Vote before, it's very crucial now.  Also because MAGA support is strongest in ex-urban and rural areas, it's hard to mobilize GOTV efforts.   On the flip side, Democrats have started to understand this so you notice, there are no efforts from Democrats to register voters or GOTV efforts anymore.  Democrats are using direct mail and text messages. In the dynamic and changing landscape, Republicans must make a huge effort to get the polls, register voters and GOTV.   TheNews\u2122 isn't going to help because they'd rather ignore upcoming elections now since GOTV doesn't favor the Democrats anymore.   Dem partisans and lefties pretty much always turn out to vote but they can't rely on overwhelming black, Hispanic and welfare recipient votes like they have in the past to carry them over the top. Scott Presler, may God bless that man, has done more for the MAGA movement than most of us admit.  Yes, I know he's gay but God's Mercy is for him as much as it's for each and everyone else who is a sinner, and that's all of us.  I'm going to tell you right now, Scott Presler is showing us the way forward and I hope God has a special place reserved for Scott Presler in Heaven for his efforts. permalink parent award report block reply Scumbag-reddit 5 points 1 day ago You guys know that the Ukraine is the central hub for money laundering and black market activity in all of Europe, made possible by a CIA revolution that installed a hand-picked Zelensky, among other Ukrainian \"leaders\" and that's why they're all getting paid by the US govt permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 1 day ago Trying to read the OP title would give Godzilla a stroke, wtf is he trying to say? permalink parent award report block reply Standingoak 1 points 1 day ago Panama papers show they aren't alone.

It's Mindich, someone with extensive links to Israel. Where he is now, btw. If \"anti-corruption agencies\" are indeed controlled by the US, the greatest ally wouldn't hesitate to extradite someone so obviously corrupt, would they? Oh, and Mindich also conducts business in Russia, which is probably an uncomfortable topic with Diana. Well, folks, it's a big club, and you ain't in it. permalink award report block reply Bullseyed 12 points 1 day ago For some reason Diana doesn't mention this guy is the Minister of Justice for Ukraine and was covering up kickback bribes in the energy sector.

Scott Presler, may God bless that man, has done more for the MAGA movement than most of us admit.  Yes, I know he's gay but God's Mercy is for him as much as it's for each and everyone else who is a sinner, and that's all of us.  I'm going to tell you right now, Scott Presler is showing us the way forward and I hope God has a special place reserved for Scott Presler in Heaven for his efforts. permalink parent award report block reply\nScumbag-reddit 5 points 1 day ago You guys know that the Ukraine is the central hub for money laundering and black market activity in all of Europe, made possible by a CIA revolution that installed a hand-picked Zelensky, among other Ukrainian \"leaders\" and that's why they're all getting paid by the US govt permalink parent award report block reply\nSicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 1 day ago Trying to read the OP title would give Godzilla a stroke, wtf is he trying to say? permalink parent award report block reply\nStandingoak 1 points 1 day ago Panama papers show they aren't alone.

It's Mindich, someone with extensive links to Israel. Where he is now, btw. If \"anti-corruption agencies\" are indeed controlled by the US, the greatest ally wouldn't hesitate to extradite someone so obviously corrupt, would they? Oh, and Mindich also conducts business in Russia, which is probably an uncomfortable topic with Diana. Well, folks, it's a big club, and you ain't in it. permalink award report block reply Bullseyed 12 points 1 day ago For some reason Diana doesn't mention this guy is the Minister of Justice for Ukraine and was covering up kickback bribes in the energy sector.
