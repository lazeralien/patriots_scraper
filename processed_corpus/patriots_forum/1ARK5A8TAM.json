If they want to question you, that means they don't have enough to charge you.  Yet.  Don't give them the ammunition for your firing squad. If you are forced into it, get on video: You are invoking your 5th amendment right to remain silent. You are invoking your 6th amendment right to have an attorney present. You are invoking your 4th amendment right to refuse all searches. Then, SHUT UP ... until your attorney is present. perjury trap Broadly defined, a \u201cperjury trap\u201d occurs when a person commits one of two closely-related \u201cprocess\u201d crimes: perjury or false statement. Perjury is a lie in a legal proceeding while under oath. False statement is a lie in an unsworn statement to a government official, such as an FBI interview. The hazards of speaking to government officials, especially without counsel, and particularly during an impromptu visit from investigators, usually outweigh any possible benefit. In United States v. Brogan, the United States Supreme Court held that even an \u201cexculpatory no,\u201d that is, a simple denial of wrongdoing followed by a prompt termination of a conversation by the defendant, without any affirmative lie, constitutes a prosecutable false statement. permalink award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 2 points 3 days ago Is it shut the fuck up Friday? permalink parent award report block reply Scuffers 6 points 3 days ago anybody got a link to the full interview? permalink award report block reply Filter_Off 3 points 3 days ago https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DDiulHEWW-U permalink parent award report block reply Scuffers 1 points 3 days ago Thanks! permalink parent award report block reply NadlersNads 4 points 3 days ago Anyone in cuffs yet? permalink award report block reply Formerlurker92 1 points 3 days ago Nope permalink parent award report block reply NadlersNads 1 points 3 days ago Demoralizing.
