ACA is the worst law for the middle class in history.

And I didn't qualify for her employers insurance (not that I would have got it as it jumped to nearly $600/month for spousal coverage after the ACA passed) because even after 25 years of being together we were were not officially married, so no insurance qualification through her employer....  ACA subsidies are based on household income not individual income...

Cheapest was like $300 per month!! Wtf. Never went to the doctor and now that\u2019s like a massive amount of my income that I literally couldn\u2019t afford. Ended up taking the fine vs paying because I\u2019d be on the streets. I\u2019ll never forget early Trump days when he said it was cruel to do this to people barely getting by - to fine them.

And prices should be set. No more insurance companies negotiating deals, no more illegals soaking up services for free and causing hospitals to jack up prices. One fee for everyone regardless of how they're paying. I guarantee you too that there would be a ton of charity money and grants out there if we had a system like that. permalink award report block reply zooty 10 points 3 days ago The current style of healthcare insurance comes from a time when companies were limited in the wages they could offer and had to come up with other ways to offer compensation to attract top employees. It's government interference all the way down. permalink parent award report block reply Kolob64 5 points 3 days ago I remember that.  Nixon's wage and price controls.  Not only did we self pay for most things, the doctors wee independent businesses and could say what they believed. permalink parent award report block reply joggin_noggin 2 points 3 days ago Nah, this started under crypto-fascist FDR, who limited direct monetary compensation and created the entire 'benefits' scheme. permalink parent award report block reply Kolob64 2 points 3 days ago I remember my dad telling me about how his grandfather would rant and rave every time FDR came on the radio. permalink parent award report block reply HuggableBear 9 points 3 days ago And prices should be set. NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Have you learned nothing? \"We need government out of <X>, except for this one part where I want it involved.\" NOOOOOO. The government should stay out of it. COMPLETELY. That includes price controls, you idiot. You're asking for Communism from a different direction. Government's only function should be guard rails on the system to prevent fraud. Let the market set prices and the government's only function should be to prevent monopoly. Hospitals and doctors should be competing for your dollars with quality, and higher quality care and service should cost more, just like any other service. permalink parent award report block reply joggin_noggin 4 points 3 days ago Forcing companies to publicly list their prices and not hide them until the bill comes due is not over-burdensome government interference. It does not require the government to dictate the price for goods and services. All it does is remove the option for one healthcare company to screw prospective patients with gotcha fees. permalink parent award report block reply HuggableBear 2 points 2 days ago I apologize, I thought you meant prices should be set for services and be the same everywhere. Yes, prices should be publicly available and the same no matter how they are paid. permalink parent award report block reply AndanteAndante 6 points 3 days ago We had that growing up from my dads job. It was called Major Medical. permalink parent award report block reply Kolob64 4 points 3 days ago I had it until the ACA took over. permalink parent award report block reply Greenhills 11 points 3 days ago The problem is, medical providers sign contracts with insurance companies forbidding them from allowing you to pay cash if you are insured. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried it for this reason. Some wont even allow you to make an appt without proof of insurance. I thought trump signed an executive order Biden never overturned requiring providers and hospitals to provide transparent pricing. What a new law should require providers to show you the cash price for fixed procedures and tests. permalink award report block reply Datamancer 6 points 3 days ago Sounds like grounds for a 'tortious interference with contract' class action suit against all insurance companies in all markets. permalink parent award report block reply remindmelater 11 points 3 days ago Who would have figured that if they added a middleman/middlemen who wants to make a darned good living that the medical bill will be much much higher....? permalink award report block reply BBvarn 10 points 3 days ago Don't bitch to Trump about your healthcare.

When our state finally adopted their rules, every insurance company fled the state and the marketplace was a nightmare.  We dropped it and did self pay with the Medi Share.  Never once used it, but it was in case of an emergency--car accident or cancer or something. Prayed a lot and God is good--didn't have a problem.  Saved us about 9K per year. permalink award report block reply Kolob64 6 points 3 days ago We have been on Medishare for over a decade now, have never used it.  We just pay cash for everything. permalink parent award report block reply South_Florida_Guy 5 points 3 days ago There was nothing wrong with the healthcare insurance market before Obongo came along and ruined it. The only thing that ever needing fixing to make it better was to kick out all of the illegals from the county that used ERs like a McDonald's drive thru which drove up costs of the actual healthcare. Besides that it was perfectly affordable. permalink award report block reply RememberCharlieKirk 5 points 3 days ago Given that the wrongly titled Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, how did Obama ever win his 2012 re-election? Did the true horrors of the Act occur years later? Were the high costs not felt immediately? permalink award report block reply Nameless_Mofo 5 points 3 days ago First of all, he won through voter fraud of course. Second, yes the true horrors (individual mandate and such) kicked in years later, as he was about to leave office. permalink parent award report block reply Kolob64 4 points 3 days ago Romney did the same in Mass which left them with a fiscal nightmare after he left office. permalink parent award report block reply AbrahamLincoln 4 points 3 days ago Romney ran against him and he sucks. permalink parent award report block reply YodaBannon 3 points 3 days ago Obama really milked that shit like he saved the world with this bullshit. permalink award report block reply ThisTrainHasNoBrakes 3 points 3 days ago ACA and insurance are bullshit, but so is this video.

It's the same with prescriptions; when I was younger I drove to a pharmacy 90m away four times a year to pick up a prescription for $100 instead of $800 at the pharmacies in town. That's a broken market if ever there was one. permalink parent award report block reply ThisTrainHasNoBrakes 2 points 3 days ago Oh it\u2019s absolutely a broken market, I build medical systems could teach a whole college course on it. The short version is because there is no real capitalist market because the payments are often divorced from the need for care.  And we are all \u201cforced\u201d into the market by \u201cneeding\u201d insurance.  It\u2019s all a scam. permalink parent award report block reply Wozzing 3 points 3 days ago Healthcare would be a lot cheaper if every American didn\u2019t spend a couple hundred dollars a month for medication just so they can remain fat.  Sure the insurance company pays for it, but that money is coming from somewhere. permalink award report block reply ACActual 3 points 3 days ago Im quitting Insurance permalink award report block reply BasedBoyScout 3 points 3 days ago I liked how it was Obamacare when it was going to let you keep your doctor and lower your premiums. Then it was the Affordable Care Act when all that turned out to not be true. Then it somehow became Trumps fault in 2025 because he won't let Democrats subsidize infinite brown people. permalink award report block reply Psalm-118_24 3 points 3 days ago Insurance companies  and HOSPITALS.  If you're like our state, look around you at hospital expansion.  Our hospitals made a killing during covid, not only of patients but on their finances too.  Also, if all the illegals and freeloaders are removed from taxpayer funded programs, the rest of us will have our costs wgo down because we won't be  paying for the illegals/freeloaders. permalink award report block reply conservativefrank 3 points 3 days ago My insurance was $97 per month with a $2000 deductible and $4000 out of pocket limit before Obamacare. Today, it's $1600 per month with a $5000 deductible and $8000 out of pocket limit. Thanks Obamacare. At least I, a 58 year old single man, have maternity coverage. permalink award report block reply zooty 2 points 3 days ago The doctor will order something you maybe don't need, the insurance company will deny your claim and you'll be stuck with the bills for overpriced insurance and the services you wanted it to cover. permalink award report block reply lul_cheto 2 points 3 days ago A big reason for the discount is because insurance companies drag their feet and require tons of paperwork for doctors to get paid.. so if you pay out of pocket you eliminate the middle man saving the doctors a ton of money.. A friend helps run a company that's makes millions a year just buying debt off of doctors , paying the doctors up front and waiting for the insurance company to pay out years later.. One doctor sold them 6m in debt for 3million.. took 3 years for them to get the money. permalink award report block reply Maganifice7 2 points 3 days ago When they wanted me to pay $500 a month for health insurance, I said no. Still don't have insurance to this day. If it wasn't required for my mortgage or diving, I wouldn't have that either. permalink award report block reply Oodles 2 points 3 days ago This will not change.

And I knew the moment they had a 'mandate' to force everyone into it that it was bullshit. Sorry if you had to for whatever reason, but fuck these communist faggots and all their fucking bullshit. permalink award report block reply presticus 1 points 3 days ago Before Obamacare i was paying about $50 a month for a catastrophic plan that had $1000 deductible, and a cost share after deductible where i only paid 20% upto a cap i forget after which the insurance paid 100%. After Obamacare the insurance company ended that plan and i went on the State exchange created by the ACA. I was paying $140ish a month for a plan that covered more stuff upfront but ultimately i would pay more out of pocket in the event if an emergency. By the time i found a job 4 years ago that offered health insurance i was paying $220 a month for plan on the exchange that was worse then the one i was forced to get due to Obamacare. Because of rising insurance costs last year my employer had to switch from a plan where they covered 100% of the monthly premium to a different plan where the employee has to pay 10% of the monthly and the out of pocket deductible doubled. permalink award report block reply Stlpoolguy 1 points 3 days ago There's always been a huge cash discount.

After Obamacare the insurance company ended that plan and i went on the State exchange created by the ACA. I was paying $140ish a month for a plan that covered more stuff upfront but ultimately i would pay more out of pocket in the event if an emergency. By the time i found a job 4 years ago that offered health insurance i was paying $220 a month for plan on the exchange that was worse then the one i was forced to get due to Obamacare. Because of rising insurance costs last year my employer had to switch from a plan where they covered 100% of the monthly premium to a different plan where the employee has to pay 10% of the monthly and the out of pocket deductible doubled. permalink award report block reply\nStlpoolguy 1 points 3 days ago There's always been a huge cash discount.
