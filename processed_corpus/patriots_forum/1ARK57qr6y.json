Continuously actually means continuously. You all do realize how lazy politicos actually are, correct?\n6 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save RealmanPwns 10 points 4 days ago Republicans have already started the process. It requires these steps which Republicans have already done step 1 on Nov. 7th. Start with the Motion and Prolong the Legislative Day: Thune moves to proceed to the bill. The Senate recesses (instead of adjourning) during breaks, keeping everything on the same legislative day. This prevents the \"speech clock\" from resetting\u2014Rule XIX limits each senator to two speeches per legislative day on the same question (e.g., the motion to proceed).\nEnforce Speaking Limits: Republicans stay mostly silent but raise points of order if Democrats go off-topic (debate must be germane for the first three hours daily). Violators must yield the floor, counting as one speech used. Any Democratic motions to delay (e.g., quorum calls) get tabled by simple majority vote (51-49 or whatever the tally is), blocking resets. Appeals of rulings? Also tabled by simple majority.\nDaily Cloture Filings to Accelerate Exhaustion: Republicans file cloture (to end debate) on the motion each day. When it \"ripens\" (after ~30 hours), it forces anyone speaking to yield, using up a speech. If cloture fails (as expected without 60 votes), Democrats must immediately use their second speech to keep filibustering\u2014limiting them to ~5-10 hours total per senator before exhaustion.\nEndgame: Simple Majority Vote Once Speeches Run Out: With ~10-15 Democrats committed to filibustering, they'd burn through speeches in 50-100 hours (spread over calendar days but one legislative day). At that point, the presiding officer calls the question\u2014no more debate\u2014and Republicans pass the motion to proceed by simple majority (no 60-vote threshold needed for this step). permalink award report block reply dataonly OP 8 points 4 days ago Thanks for the details.

Their moral turpitude could be seen as another aspect of their traitorous psyches. The bastards, along with the Dems (all of whom are C.I.A. assets) are effectively rendering Trump a lame duck President. permalink parent award report block reply 2016TrumpMAGA 2 points 4 days ago Yes, I knew that. What we call the 'filibuster' is not a filibuster, it is the threat of a filibuster. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 4 days ago Yes but the virtual filibuster provides cover for RINOs.
