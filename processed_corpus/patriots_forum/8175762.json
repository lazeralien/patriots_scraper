Imagine admitting that the left's accusations that MAGA hate women and browns are true. I'm starting to think it's true that there's a coordinated and intentional subversion campaign being waged against us which aims to make MAGA lose the midterms by turning away all the normies that helped us win 2024 by portraying us as everything that the left says we are.

I do believe the rest of the woman haters are exactly that, women haters. permalink parent award report block reply therealrivensky 4 points 4 days ago The only way to stop Trump is through a massively coordinated demoralization campaign that targets his base. It's clever because it does 2 things: 1. Makes sure that MAGA loses every election that doesn't have Trump's name on the ballot. 2. Makes sure that MAGA never fixes our elections so that every win we've had thus far was ultimately for nothing. And these people have basically been appointed to do just that. They are overtly helping the left in stalling MAGA, but they are doing this in a way that the left never could. Because the left can't make us look racist or misogynistic anymore to normies no matter how hard they or the fake news keep lying about it, but these people actually can. They can because we tolerate them in our base even as they go around whining nonstop about women and browns. What we need to understand is that most of these people just don't vote so we don't need them to win any election either. And that's because these people don't really care about winning any election, just about being proven right. You'll notice that all of them will eventually tell you that elections are rigged and pointless, if you listen to their whining long enough. Because that's the end goal, if MAGA doesn't vote, how can MAGA win? So yeah, these are low energy losers who should have never been allowed on this site.
