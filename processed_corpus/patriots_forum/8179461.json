I was ambivalent until I found out 1/3 of gen z got murdered in the womb simply because of lifestyle reasons. This accounts for over 15 million abortions for that generation. It\u2019s literally more murder than all wars and homicides in us history. If only white men voted this country would have a 2/3 super majority in both houses and the presidency. If we got 10% more of the white woman vote we\u2019d do the same thing. permalink parent award report block reply ImYourHuckleberry24 23 points 3 days ago Yep. Every female I know of personally that aborted their innocent unborn baby, did it due to inconvenience. Imagine that. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 38 points 3 days ago Had an ex dump me for some dr. A year later she texts me to tell me he dumped her because she was pregnant with my kid. She didn\u2019t even bother to tell me before she got an abortion. Insanely enough she wanted to get back together. Spent years texting me every six months or so. These hoes are mercenary. permalink parent award report block reply 45ichooseu 16 points 3 days ago Or she was pregnant with his kid and bounced. I've also seen the baby trap technique. I've seen this countless times with male friends. I was pretty good with women and even I frequently found myself up against women with commitment issues, leaving due to \"boredom/it's not a good time/too busy with school or work/needed to pursue career\", or simply found someone they thought was an upgrade. I've seen them voraciously go through friend groups or even family of their ex, permanently harming other relationships in the process. Women largely do whatever they want, can justify any behavior no matter how atrocious, absolutely can't consider others unless it also benefits them, and develop entitlement over the most absurd things simply because it feels good to them. Honestly, when Socrates wrote \"a woman's oath, I inscribe on water\", I totally get it. I understand every warning in The Book of Proverbs and elsewhere in the Bible. The Bible especially is 100% spot on regarding female behavior. I feel for you dude. I get it completely, been there many times. On the upside, men under 40 are going to be the biggest punishment to women moving forward. We've seen what makes them laugh, their tears are going to fall on deaf ears and once a cohesive male political block forms, women are going to get checked hard. In five years, I've seen \"repeal the 19th\" go from fringe MGTOW dudes to being spoken openly on the right as a discussion point. How long till it's a mainstream idea? permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... ImYourHuckleberry24 14 points 3 days ago I'm so sorry. She killed your child.

Too many people don\u2019t seem to understand that and act like repealing the 19th would be as easy as Trump signing an EO declaring it null and void. It only takes 13 states to stop a new amendment. If we had the votes to repeal the 19th we would also have the votes to do anything else we want and the conversation would be moot. permalink parent award report block reply WoeToYou 11 points 3 days ago It might take 100 years to get there but don\u2019t stop talking about it. Make it mainstream. permalink parent award report block reply goldkeyboardwarrior 2 points 3 days ago You can literally count on one hand the number of countries in the world that don\u2019t allow women to vote and almost all of them are third world countries (technically Vatican City doesn\u2019t let women vote but they\u2019re about the size of a football stadium). I don\u2019t see the US rushing to be the first superpower to ban women from voting in modern day. And one thing people don\u2019t realize about the 19th is it didn\u2019t explicitly allow women to vote but it banned states from banning women to vote. Several states already allowed women to vote so a repeal that does what people pushing for it want would have to have an explicit ban on women voting baked into it. Otherwise states would still be allowed to let women vote. permalink parent award report block reply view 8 more comments... iamherefortheluls 1 points 2 days ago the cultural push must begin now if that is ever to happen.

I don\u2019t see the US rushing to be the first superpower to ban women from voting in modern day. And one thing people don\u2019t realize about the 19th is it didn\u2019t explicitly allow women to vote but it banned states from banning women to vote. Several states already allowed women to vote so a repeal that does what people pushing for it want would have to have an explicit ban on women voting baked into it. Otherwise states would still be allowed to let women vote. permalink parent award report block reply view 8 more comments... iamherefortheluls 1 points 2 days ago the cultural push must begin now if that is ever to happen.

Excellent. permalink award report block reply\nNellie_the_Beaut 2 points 3 days ago I\u2019ve watched Carl Higbie a few times and he\u2019s pretty great.  Well spoken, spot on and doesn\u2019t pull any punches.  Refreshing if you\u2019re in the mood for a traditional evening news program that doesn\u2019t suck. permalink award report block reply\nboomerbutnotOKBoomer 2 points 2 days ago So glad he is saying it. Can't tell you how many of these arguments I've had with libtard women, including family. One sister is shocked -- SHOCKED I TELL YOU! - that I have guns. That i'm proud I have guns. That I make no bones about having guns, having self-defense classes under my belt, have pulled a gun on a guy who was trying to take me to his truck. AAAAARRRRRRGHGHGHGH!! Oh no! Don't defend yourself!! GAAAAAAAH permalink award report block reply\nObambi 2 points 3 days ago Even Melania was sending letters to Putin to stop instead of the midget J. Lost respect for her for that a bit. She got emotional like all broads tend to do when it comes to serious shit. permalink award report block reply\nsolarsavior 2 points 3 days ago IMO, this is why they voted for him.

Most of its citizens are pampered, weak and weak minded. Yes, even the \"tough streets\" NYC tough guys and gang affiliated are weaklings.

Somewhere along the way our men fucked up. In a more sane time most of these women would've been normal, just remember that. The way they are turning out is a failure on our part (and to some extent likely an intentional attack by foreign entities). I often notice that the women that turn out the worst had an awful or missing relationship with their father, it's a common theme. How many problems in this world can be traced back to a drought of quality, present fathers I wonder? Probably quite a lot. permalink parent award report block reply x79q3pb 2 points 2 days ago How many of those fathers were ousted by an overly emotional female and nothing to do with their parenting skills? permalink parent award report block reply\nOleander 2 points 3 days ago Who gave them the right to vote?
