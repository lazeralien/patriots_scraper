Sons cleave more to their fathers, so I'm sure he's in no rush to recant his statements. Still, actions speak louder than words, and the next generation's already being primed to enter the halls of power; he's one to watch to see if he's legit, or just another psyop. permalink award report block reply vongregormench 4 points 2 days ago First off, why do republicans think this is a bad position, and second, she\u2019s not responsible for her adult son\u2019s opinions.

And his \"summer Chad heartthrob\" looks would help marketing maga to young girls. His parents were both political figures maybe he is setting up a potential future and is laying groundwork.  Then again maybe he is a secret deep state asset. We seem cool with Sidney Sweeny but besides shooting some guns she hasn't said much, she wears a star of David necklace (but is apparently not jewish) but who knows what her deal is but when she doesn't answer a question on a GQ interview we are all gushing like simps - \"ohhhh so brave,  she just looked at that bitch and didn't give her what she wanted... how cool...\"   calm down boys. She hasn't said shit, but this kid with two politician parents says a ton yet we are giving him side eye. Sorry... just struck a nerve.

Sons cleave more to their fathers, so I'm sure he's in no rush to recant his statements. Still, actions speak louder than words, and the next generation's already being primed to enter the halls of power; he's one to watch to see if he's legit, or just another psyop. permalink award report block reply\nvongregormench 4 points 2 days ago First off, why do republicans think this is a bad position, and second, she\u2019s not responsible for her adult son\u2019s opinions.

Is it like how every male singer women liked back in school was \"probably gay\" ... im just saying it would be great if what he is saying is true. And his \"summer Chad heartthrob\" looks would help marketing maga to young girls. His parents were both political figures maybe he is setting up a potential future and is laying groundwork.  Then again maybe he is a secret deep state asset. We seem cool with Sidney Sweeny but besides shooting some guns she hasn't said much, she wears a star of David necklace (but is apparently not jewish) but who knows what her deal is but when she doesn't answer a question on a GQ interview we are all gushing like simps - \"ohhhh so brave,  she just looked at that bitch and didn't give her what she wanted... how cool...\"   calm down boys. She hasn't said shit, but this kid with two politician parents says a ton yet we are giving him side eye. Sorry... just struck a nerve. People don't know how hard it is to be an extremely attractive guy.  [Sniffles...]  it's just hard... we get so much hate from fat dorks and just generic ugly people. permalink award report block reply\nguywholikesDjtof2024 2 points 1 day ago Barron Trump v2! permalink award report block reply\nGrizzlyT55 2 points 2 days ago I wonder what his screen name is on pdw? permalink award report block reply\nEastTexasMadLad 2 points 2 days ago Sounds like a smart man to me permalink award report block reply\nGreyKnight 2 points 2 days ago Why are we \u201cgiving aid\u201d by which I mean theft of our money that was traced for the sole purpose that it could be given away simply so some people could skim off the top\u2026? permalink award report block reply\nStanwyk74 2 points 2 days ago The daughter looks like winnie cooper permalink award report block reply Krampus5150 2 points 2 days ago I had to scroll back up and look haha.
