We know the answer. This is no different that government bailouts of banks, insurance companies and other \"too big to fail\" big businesses. Economically, this is commonly described as \"privatizing the profits\" and \"socializing the losses\". Politically, this is \"legalizing the crimes\" and \"socializing the restitution\". Collectively, the \"too big to fail\" club includes \"too important to prosecute\" apparatchiks at all levels of government. These people all have \"qualified immunity\" from prosecution for their criminal acts. The sad thing is that most people are unaware of just how communistic this all is. permalink award report block reply\nHantif 5 points 10 hours ago Now disbar and ban the judge and lawyers involved.
