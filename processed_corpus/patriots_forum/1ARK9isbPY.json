It\u2019s just dwarfed by the public funding. You could probably justify some of the spending by public funds but how much? permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 2 points 2 days ago 15% of the total if not critical to National Security. 85% of total if critical to National Security. Food Military Medical Energy Education Are the only 5 that are critical to National Security. Even then they actually have to relate to National Security Which for food and military is quite obvious, Medical is a little bit more nuanced, and Education has to be specific which would be much less critical compared to the other 4, but in total as a country is directly related. Industry and other aspects are not exactly up there, but the major difference is that they are much more in the private sector than these 5. Now here is the funny part about it is that any one of these can change depending on the country and their most critical elements that are vital to their nation. What I described is America because Education is a national security factor in enemies using colleges and schools to brainwash children to their ideology. I would talk about energy, but I tend to be long winded whenever I start going into details. So to put simply everything else runs on energy therefore Energy is Critical. permalink parent award report block reply DebunkTheLeft 8 points 2 days ago All these science niggaz are total grifters.

It's a complete waste of time to spend your life writing papers that only 5 people might ever read or understand or appreciate.  It also means that, if everyone is in their own narrow specialty, it's impossible to tell if someone else is really good or just faking it.

They judge academics on paper numbers, not quality.  So people team to inflate their numbers. permalink parent award report block reply footinmouth 4 points 1 day ago Self citations do not count. But there are labs that will cite other labs papers all the time. permalink parent award report block reply fskfsk 12 points 2 days ago Problem #1: The measure of \"how good an academic you are\" is number of papers.  Papers went from \"this is how scientists communicate with each other\" to \"this is how you get and keep your career\". Problem #2: The way publications and hiring works is \"peer review\".  This means political censorship and favoritism enter the picture.  \"I don't like X, so I won't publish his paper, and I won't vote to hire him or give him tenure.\" Problem #3: If a scientist wanted to go and check already-published papers to see if they're valid, or present them in a more understandable format, that's a \"waste of time\" and he would not get hired or promoted. permalink award report block reply TPMJB 10 points 2 days ago China steals all our pharma insider information anyway.

I respond with \u201c98% of scientists agree\u2026 with whomever funded their research\u201d. permalink parent award report block reply Moose_Antlers 6 points 2 days ago So much of medical research is low-quality slop. 85% of it is not reproducible, even the \"landmark\" studies. Why? They've turned universities into grant farms. The real scientists are told they have to spend their time teaching students instead of doing lab work, and the time they do get in the lab, they're going to spend 1/3 of it writing grants and begging for money to pay for the privilege of being employed at that university. It's such a scam. They don't hire professors who want to teach and are good at teaching to teach. They don't hire scientists who are good a research to do that. They hire people and force them to do both, and pay their own way. And that's before I start talking about computer modeling and the fraud that is \"climate science.\" If we wanted to spend a lot of money to build knowledge as a society, this system would be the last way you'd design to do it - and yet, here we are. I'd love love love to do research full-time, but there's no way in hell I'd step into that rat race. permalink award report block reply 10MeV 6 points 2 days ago I saw this first hand even back in the early 90s.  We were working with an NSF \u201cCenter\u201dat a major state university.  One of the profs was despairing of getting tenure because he wasn\u2019t pulling in enough grants. It was very clear that \u201cpublish or perish\u201d was very real indeed. permalink award report block reply Light_HIV_Effect 5 points 2 days ago It's all done for grant money, and has little to do with actually science or innovation. permalink award report block reply vongregormench 4 points 2 days ago Is this counting phd thesis? permalink award report block reply patrioticwinning3 6 points 2 days ago Yes, all PHD a lot of Master's and many professional degrees (eg law degrees) require the candidate to be published.

They judge academics on paper numbers, not quality.  So people team to inflate their numbers. permalink parent award report block reply footinmouth 4 points 1 day ago Self citations do not count.

Papers went from \"this is how scientists communicate with each other\" to \"this is how you get and keep your career\". Problem #2: The way publications and hiring works is \"peer review\".  This means political censorship and favoritism enter the picture.  \"I don't like X, so I won't publish his paper, and I won't vote to hire him or give him tenure.\" Problem #3: If a scientist wanted to go and check already-published papers to see if they're valid, or present them in a more understandable format, that's a \"waste of time\" and he would not get hired or promoted. permalink award report block reply\nTPMJB 10 points 2 days ago China steals all our pharma insider information anyway.

Why? They've turned universities into grant farms. The real scientists are told they have to spend their time teaching students instead of doing lab work, and the time they do get in the lab, they're going to spend 1/3 of it writing grants and begging for money to pay for the privilege of being employed at that university. It's such a scam. They don't hire professors who want to teach and are good at teaching to teach. They don't hire scientists who are good a research to do that. They hire people and force them to do both, and pay their own way. And that's before I start talking about computer modeling and the fraud that is \"climate science.\" If we wanted to spend a lot of money to build knowledge as a society, this system would be the last way you'd design to do it - and yet, here we are. I'd love love love to do research full-time, but there's no way in hell I'd step into that rat race. permalink award report block reply\n10MeV 6 points 2 days ago I saw this first hand even back in the early 90s.
