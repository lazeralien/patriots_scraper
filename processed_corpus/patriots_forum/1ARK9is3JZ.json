It will take some time for the prices to realistically come down permalink parent award report block reply ianpatrick1966 2 points 1 day ago Are we?  We need to cross the rubicon and water the tree of liberty.  We are not closer to that as so many hopium huffing retards are still \u201ctrusting the plan\u201d Atlas needs to shrug permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 2 points 2 days ago It's not happening, especially not after AI has been unleashed. Nothing stopping the detractors from saying their names were falsely put on that list. Musk also screwed the pooch by claiming on X that Trump is on the files himself. That was completely unhinged and only has made your side look legit insane. A governed ppl cannot be on constant anxiety, even when they win. If the economy doesn't get better and legal immigration halted to a trickle and illegal immigrants aren't sorted, there is no way the GOP is winning in 2026 and absolutely no way in 2028. At this current rate, I don't even see an election in 2028. permalink parent award report block reply Ch3f4554551n 2 points 2 days ago Trump is absolutely involved. Virginia Giuffre worked for him at Mar a Lago, and Trump is Roy Cohn's protege. He has had intimate knowledge of the Kompromat operation the entire time, and just plays dumb about Mossad's involvement. All of this is openly documented - I recommend Whitney Webb's book on the subject. AI is a moot point when travel logs and calendars are factored in. There is enough evidence to put Prince Andy away for life, but no one will take action on any of it, because all the Kompromat was commissioned by the CIA and Mossad. This is how the world's governments operate. Trump told us all he would end it to get elected, then simply assumed power to take the ring of sauron himself. He hoodwinked all of us, and now merely trickles out enough red meat to satiate the base. Nothing has changed. permalink parent award report block reply I_Am_John_Galt 31 points 2 days ago Between him and Bongino, who were two of the most vocal people on the subject before joining the admin, I'm really struggling to figure out how they haven't driven this to ground yet.  Yeah...I know...I'll be quiet now. permalink award report block reply 5DchessWatch OP 18 points 2 days ago They both wrote books about spygate.  Bonvaginos was called spygate.  I think Kash's was a kids book.  Oh wait he wrote government gangsters. They get in and immediately do nothing.  They are like the 2 dogs barking at each other thru the fence, until an owner opens the fence door and they stop barking and sit down staring at each other.  Owner shuts gate.  Barking resumes This describes the totality of their service permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 12 points 2 days ago Grifters, grift. For others its prestige. Thats why Bondi blows my mind. She worked all her adult life to get to this point. AG is top of her profession. Then for now 10 months does jack.

Sometimes later that night at their house. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 3 points 2 days ago The only answer that makes sense to me is once they took office, somebody essentially threatened their lives or their families lives, if they went after certain individuals. There's really no other good explanation. Then usually the truth comes out years or decades later when someone finally spills the beans to the public or the conspiracy folks figure it out permalink parent award report block reply RedCalifornia 1 points 2 days ago Remember that book deals are also how the left pays off its own. permalink parent award report block reply Psarg 2 points 2 days ago I think they're worried about nuclear Armageddon. permalink parent award report block reply FuckCommies 24 points 2 days ago Pussy is the downfall of every ugly dude with power and influence.

She's the beard or worse. permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch OP 2 points 2 days ago Kash isn't ugly.  But he talks a bit like a nerd.  One notch above Shapiro tier nasality.  And sniffs WAY too much during interviews.  My impression is he's a cokehead.  But other than sniff doesn't act like one.  Sorry kash.  Maybe he's got a medical problem or is addicted to some shit snorty drug that will give him glaucoma, like Flonase. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 6 points 2 days ago His official photo looks like he's on crack tbh permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch OP 2 points 1 day ago People have this idea that he has a glass eye that goes off looking the wrong direction.

Seems to be an Israeli cock sucker! permalink award report block reply Hyperlight381 10 points 2 days ago I was such a big advocate of his originally. The giant sized crow i have to eat is substantial. He was compromised from the start which is why he was allowed to take the position permalink award report block reply Metal4Freedom 2 points 2 days ago Thanksgiving is coming. It can't taste worse than turkey. Just slather it with enough gravy and nobody will notice. permalink parent award report block reply Ralphusthegreatus 9 points 2 days ago Is there really people here who think anything is going to happen? permalink award report block reply DanIsSwell 4 points 2 days ago I know this is the off limits question; but is anyone starting to wonder about the validity of Trump himself? permalink parent award report block reply IPMang 5 points 2 days ago I was just thinking about that... But getting shot in the ear really makes it hard to believe. It's almost like we'd need to believe that was faked if we're to believe Trump isn't legit. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 3 points 2 days ago He was already President for 4 years. If you haven't learned to trust Trump (which is the nice thing about his Presidency... you know he has competent people working for him) then you haven't learned anything. It's much worse living with a Dem POTUS and hearing shitty news every day like record numbers of illegals crossing the border (over 3 MILLION in 2023 alone, more than an entire army). Meanwhile the Trump admin has released ZERO illegal aliens inside the US for the last 6 month, a historically low number. Biden was releasing them on parole and flying/bussing them across the country on taxpayers' dime permalink parent award report block reply JoinTheDiscussion 1 points 2 days ago That was enough to make him compromised and then fill his admin with do-nothings permalink parent award report block reply DanIsSwell 1 points 1 day ago That\u2019s true, and that assassination attempt is always the thing that wrangles me back in. It\u2019s just hard to understand a lot of what he does and doesn\u2019t do. I can\u2019t blame it on ignorance or stupidity, because Trump is not those things. permalink parent award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 4 points 2 days ago Nah dude this is a forum for Trump supporters, speaking badly about Trump breaks rule #1. And keep this in mind, so far Comey, Bolton and Letitia James have been indicted by a federal grand jury, and Schiff and Brennan are coming up. I think Trump's DOJ has made a good start at going against these evil plotters permalink parent award report block reply Txiribiton 2 points 2 days ago Obviously, you only have to value actions. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro -3 points 2 days ago Look, Trump can only go so far. You'll are expecting miracles. The man is on his last few years on this Earth and has been fighting on your side and taken so much shit as it is. If this is the way you'll treat the man, with this much disdain, do you honestly think anyone will ever again, from your side, want to take the reigns of the GOP leadership?? Even Vance, a literal war veteran and a guy who worked his way from poverty and married a Hindu woman, whilst being a nominal Christian and became a convert to Catholicism gets flak from you pissants for being married to a Hindu woman. Your current First Lady has done nude photo ops when she was young and she is celebrated but a smart, educated, American born, Indian woman who married her college sweetheart gets shit upon? And that too by the side that is supposedly her husband's ally?? If this is the way you'll treat your own, even your own will walk away. You'll will find yourselves with fewer and fewer friends and even more scattered and destroyed. It is embarrassing to watch on the world stage and you'll cannot continue this behaviour and think this is a winning strategy. permalink parent award report block reply JoinTheDiscussion 1 points 2 days ago Bondi, Kash, Bongino.. He's NOT by himself but is it a wonder that he's surrounded himself with do-nothings ONCE AGAIN.. permalink parent award report block reply Cacciali_Via 1 points 2 days ago Your party lost to Trump twice. What do you know about winning strategies? There is nothing wrong with not normalizing race mixing. I've not seen anyone say personal things about Vance's wife. People just wish he had more wisdom in his youth to go along with his brains. permalink parent award report block reply Ralphusthegreatus 1 points 1 day ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply HazelHen 9 points 2 days ago Epstein files permalink award report block reply SpellingContable 8 points 2 days ago I predict Kash and Bongino doing another 'Freakout Vid\" interview together. I reckon just before they went on air last time they were sent a vid of a person who resembles one of their loved ones being chopped up alive, with the vid title 'Guess Whos Next' permalink award report block reply UCantStumpTheTrump 8 points 2 days ago Nah someone from the intel community (including foreign agencies) probably credibly threatened them and their families with death if they went after certain individuals or organizations. hence the look of terror on their faces. someone got to them early on and neutralized them. Trump needs to realize this and tell them to get with the program or get lost. Put in some dude with nothing to lose who will make the right decisions permalink parent award report block reply SpellingContable 5 points 2 days ago Yeah, I previously said they sent a photo of an agency assassin at their kids school at pickup time, or some similar interaction. But now I like the theory \"Hey, this woman looks like your wife. Watch me chop her up.\"  video theory. Or they were in Dans home videoing his wife while she slept. permalink parent award report block reply JoeFromHR 7 points 2 days ago No, his big test was how he handled the Epstein case. He not only failed, he betrayed everyone. permalink award report block reply Liberalism_is_mental 7 points 2 days ago The fact that she wasn't immediately arrested and questioned shows that we're back to the deepstate in charge.  Even if they arrested her, questioned her and then cleared her name, would show they're serious about it.  Total crickets is a very bad and telling sign. permalink award report block reply TrumpAndGodWin 5 points 2 days ago Apparently she or Zhe is in a CIA safe house. alexjonesapp dot com permalink parent award report block reply Cacciali_Via 1 points 2 days ago Why do you think she isn't a cooperating witness? permalink parent award report block reply learntocode 6 points 2 days ago I can think of a bunch of other shit.

Sure, there will be some arrests but none of it related to what needs to be done.  The political criminals are fully in control. permalink award report block reply orange_kek_great 4 points 2 days ago He won't do shit. permalink award report block reply Justjayce 3 points 2 days ago From burn bag to toilet paper I bet permalink award report block reply raptoris2 3 points 2 days ago Kash and Bondi need to be replaced. permalink award report block reply Obambi 3 points 2 days ago The problem with Trump rich inner circle people is that they\u2019re loyal to Israel first and that fucks up MAGA for the middle income folks and why we see this giant let down. They don\u2019t see it because they\u2019re in this bubble. They don\u2019t go to the grocery store or struggle with constant bills. permalink award report block reply Melodicgrog 3 points 2 days ago He\u2019s failed every other test, but this OSS the big one I guess permalink award report block reply IPMang 2 points 2 days ago Has Trump spoken about this case at all or recently?

Appoint Matt Geatz as interim AG and let him pick the FBI director. permalink award report block reply Steve56775 1 points 1 day ago Trump has wasted a fourth of his presidency on these two traitors.

Under 18 criminal offences go to the antifa equivalent attorney general and over 18 crimes go to the federal state attorney. Again, DC is fucking weird and people shouldn't be living there.

There is enough evidence to put Prince Andy away for life, but no one will take action on any of it, because all the Kompromat was commissioned by the CIA and Mossad. This is how the world's governments operate. Trump told us all he would end it to get elected, then simply assumed power to take the ring of sauron himself.

You'll are expecting miracles. The man is on his last few years on this Earth and has been fighting on your side and taken so much shit as it is. If this is the way you'll treat the man, with this much disdain, do you honestly think anyone will ever again, from your side, want to take the reigns of the GOP leadership?? Even Vance, a literal war veteran and a guy who worked his way from poverty and married a Hindu woman, whilst being a nominal Christian and became a convert to Catholicism gets flak from you pissants for being married to a Hindu woman. Your current First Lady has done nude photo ops when she was young and she is celebrated but a smart, educated, American born, Indian woman who married her college sweetheart gets shit upon? And that too by the side that is supposedly her husband's ally?? If this is the way you'll treat your own, even your own will walk away.
