Of course, the hindu supremacists are not being specific with their attacks, they do hate everyone.  A billion immoral people who think you are dirt, and should be scammed, mocked and destroyed. They can do what they want in their hole back there, but when they invade the West with their lawyers and Caste System they implement everything here. Only hire each other, only sell to each other, and of course will find any way to get into power.  They also enjoy killing their female babies, so your neighborhoods will suddenly have a lot of male India people. The peer-reviewed study found that Indian-born women in Ontario were significantly more likely than Canadian-born women to give birth to boys As they control Silicon Valley, so much of what they do will stay hidden. A 50-year-old man in northern India was killed in a mob lynching on Monday night allegedly over rumours that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. The northeastern Indian state of Manipur remains in a tense state of unease weeks after a devastating spate of violence led to the death of at least 73 individuals, most of them Christians, and the burning, damage or destruction of nearly 400 churches. US culture breeds 'laziness' and 'mediocrity', says Vivek Ramaswamy Over 20 Indian-origin persons have been sentenced up to 20 years in prison in the U.S. for their involvement in a multimillion-dollar India-based call center scam which defrauded thousands Sugar Land-area Hindu temple now home to third largest statue in the U.S. permalink award report block reply HOSEQ 3 points 3 days ago Call them exactly what they are:: MUSLIMS.... permalink parent award report block reply PegasoSeiya 4 points 3 days ago Nah Hindus hate Muslims and Muslim hate Hindus.

India IS Muslim, it may also have Christianity, and Buddism, but the entire \"\"Hindu\"\"Religion is 100% Completely gone, only the name remains.... permalink parent award report block reply keeman 2 points 4 days ago So deport the problematic Indians in Silicon Valley and then we have no more interest in this shit.  That is a good outcome for me.  Not only do I not care who controls India, but the Constitution does not authorize the fedgov to do anything about it.

That is protestant stuff. permalink parent award report block reply guywholikesDjtof2024 2 points 3 days ago No, Matthew 24:40 . But it's very good to see you know catholicism is compromise and addition, not consistent Christian tradition. permalink parent award report block reply America1stAndOnly 0 points 3 days ago No, that's talking about the return of Christ and how not everyone will pass judgment and make it to Heaven. It is not the Catholic's rapture in which they claim all the true believers will just vanish in a puff of smoke one day. But thank you for pointing me to one of the verse's that led to this kind of thinking. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

The world is too complex for you to definitely claim \"NO\". The best you can do and still be not Christian, is to be agnostic on whether God answers prayers or not. Try Deism.

Biblical Christianity is true, and provides anti communist beliefs. Their beliefs were downstream fron atheism. The strong survive in Darwinism/atheism. The Shadows and Evil Vorlons (they became evil later on) were strong. They lacked morality, and yet were fit as a fiddle. So much for \"the golden rule\" keeping them in check.

What commands does athiesm give people? over whos flavor of Chistianity was the best was turning the other cheek. Breaking news: people rebel against the Bible. You're proving my belief that people should be BIBLICAL Christians instead of inconsistent ones. How about all those proto-protestants who were either killed, exiled or excommunicated because they questioned the divinity of Christ. Catholics believe in purgatory, which is nowhere in the Bible. The catholics did what they did because they rebelled. If they obeyed God they would not do that. Atheists always get confused between unBiblical catholicism and Biblical Christianity. Not surprising, given they lack knowledge. How about the Slavs that were forced to convert by the sword. By the islamic sword? That sure waa turning the other cheek. I could do this all day. Your hands are bloody and you refuse to admit that its not innocent as you make it out to be. Rebellion against God is bad no matter who does it.
