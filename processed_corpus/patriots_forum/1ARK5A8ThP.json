Meanwhile instead of fixing old stuff, we are building new stuff by knocking down trees so reach people can get away from the problem areas. permalink parent award report block reply BigMikesSwingingCock 1 points 3 days ago Our interstates are a complete disaster; a state of disrepair. Everywhere you drive, there's more potholes than you can shake a stick at, so it's not just on a federal level, it's also state and county. Public transportation is a clown show, it's basically a lawless zoo. Not to mention that any projects that receive funding end up having all the funds embezzled, and projects scrapped.

I sold my starter home after 12 years (refinanced once) and it\u2019s been 13 years in the current one. You\u2019re not committed to that full mortgage timeframe, it\u2019s not a sentence. Only in rare circumstances should someone target their first home as their last home. Sometimes it works out, but most of the time you learn what you like/don\u2019t like in the first home. If you\u2019ve lived under your means and saved you\u2019ll have the option of renting the first one out when you buy your 2nd and the proceeds from that will help to pay it off early. permalink parent award report block reply daty_dato 2 points 3 days ago and they don't understand inflation.

The simple money devaluation will make that mortgage better then a 30 year. Top of my head 10% better. You can always pay it faster or invest with historically better returns. It all depends on the interest rate. And you have a home now. If that's the main driver. We need other reforms that would be better but just as unlikely.. permalink parent award report block reply\ndaty_dato 2 points 3 days ago and they don't understand inflation.
