{"id": "1ARK9nNhv3", "contents": "80 Anyone else feel like nothing is being accomplished or followed thru? posted 10 hours ago by UH60MAGA 27 comments award share report block So far just feel like we have more setbacks than any gains. -Antifa declared domestic terrorist yet no arrests -Deportations are going slow and not at a pace that is noticeable. -Bringing in H1B people instead of helping citizens/pushing trade schools -600k Chinese students? Was this something from the talks with winnie the pooh last week? -Whatever happened to those talks of the Doge check talks? Or the audit of Fort Knox? -no arrests of the deep state for their roles in J6 Sure we have had some wins, but they have felt minor when the big stuff people voted for seems to have been backburnered or ignored. Did the deep state get to Trump? Or is he making the same mistake as last term and surronding himself with people who are sabotaging him?\n27 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Around the Web 1 Simple Hack to Cut Your Electric Bill (Try Tonight) GadgetCyno SHILL_DETECTOR 10 points 10 hours ago i dont think he has the guts to do what needs to be done permalink award report block reply Be_The_Change 2 points 10 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink parent award report block reply hilboggins 7 points 9 hours ago Almost feels like they replaced trump with a reptilian clone permalink award report block reply PresElectKekPede 7 points 9 hours ago Trump is a living paradox in that he cares so much about what people think of him that he ran for President but that same obsession is preventing him from doing the things that made us vote for him. permalink award report block reply BannedAccount 5 points 8 hours ago His ego and legacy are more important to him than the American people with the irony being that actually helping Americans would hand him the legacy of being the greatest American in our history on par with the likes of George Washington. permalink parent award report block reply PresElectKekPede 1 points 6 hours ago I fully agree. permalink parent award report block reply DarthEP 3 points 9 hours ago Weird. permalink parent award report block reply someguy7738 6 points 9 hours ago And absolutely nothing done about election fraud, at all.
