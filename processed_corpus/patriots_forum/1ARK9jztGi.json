There was an imbalance this first year with too much focus on peace outside the home and not enough in our own country.  That came with a sacrifice and happens when workaholics make their jobs more important than time with their family.  I believe President Trump is going through a transition of grounding back to America First, actually in the role for the first time since inauguration.  That said, children of neglect learn to cope without the parent neglecting them.  They say they don't need them, and the more that happens, the more independent they become, the coping is the fact that the neglect makes it harder to ask for what they need in healthy ways.  Example:  Trump needs to XXX, rather than asking healthy...I need your help Mr. President, as Dilbert did recently when asking for his cancer treatment approval. permalink parent award report block reply KekistaniMemeLord 1 points 1 day ago PW has been infested with these low energy faggots and shills for a long time and its starting to bubble over.

People's attention is too scattered now, so they focus on TV for the boomers and podcasts with high female audiences and manufacture the drama for the lib narrative. This naturally creates a counter-drama in other spaces like Twitter, and oh, by the way - they actually did drag a lot of people along for the ride this time to amp it all up by forcing a lot of $ to stop for a month. So, they did get people talking, but still weren't able to move the needle in public opinion. permalink parent award report block reply Trump43v3r 1 points 1 day ago Insightful response, I\u2019ll keep my mind open.

Are you guys new around here? Do you understand what just happened to the Dems? You can't out of one side of your mouth say the Dems want to put Trump in jail or flat out assassinate him and then out of the other side of your mouth say they were all in on it. It just doesn't match reality. I remember the days when Tom Daschle would drive up to the Reagan White House in a hearse to pick up the Presidents budget as a symbolic gesture that it will be dead on arrival. No, the Democrats discovered this one time that they lose when Republicans grow a spine. Anyone who has been following politics for more than a week knows the Democrats did not want to learn that lesson. They much prefer it when they smack the Republicans in the head, the Republican cowers in fear and the Dems do whatever they want. Being told no for 39 days was definitely not in their playbook. Yesterday the Democrat armor cracked....we need to remember that. permalink award report block reply DatTrumpDoh 7 points 1 day ago Most of this site has been infiltrated by bots who just signal against whatever wins the right gets in order to demoralize. permalink parent award report block reply PROCIsAsshoe 3 points 19 hours ago and they all post their whiny bitchy takes within a few minutes of the post. not real people to be so 'on top' of things. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 4 points 1 day ago I will present something of a case. Firstly Trump isn't perfect; I think part of the problem is generally frustration on both sides. The whiners are frustrated because they see legit issues of the agenda discarded or seemingly ignored. Once Trump took power suddenly he didn't care about Epstien; other issues he has tried to generally gaslight the public on and so; the whiners whine. They are the canaries in the coal mine and its frustrating to tell the kid to stop touching the hot stove and burning himself and yet he insists its fine. On the flip side the cheerleaders are believing that any claim to the counter of Trumps spin is somehow an attempt to undermine the administration - they hate when something a legit win is spun as a loss (deportation numbers for example). They cannot see anyway to get the whiners to see things how they see them. Both sides have legit concerns; but as far as impact - the whiners arguments only work if you follow up on them and can verify the facts. If you see someone whine; in a few cases you can verify that the whine is something that is actually happening - regardless of what the admin is saying. No one things 50 year mortgages to flood the market with more debt and jacking up the price of housing is a good idea - the fact Trump is in real-estate means I have to assume he knows some basic economic facts about how housing prices are. I won't rant about the constant deflection of the job market claims. If the whiners are ignored and the gaslighting is welcomed - then MAGA will be having a party in the big tent while the democrats set fire to it outside - the whiners are warning you of the enemy movements and the gaps in the defenses and positive thinking or not having a solution is not going to improve that situation. Its hard because frankly everyone is moving toward the \"I don't want to hear it\" mindset and its unhealthy for MAGA if its serious about actually fixing the USA. The shutdown is a prime example. I don't think the democrats lost this one; end of the day most public sentiment was that republicans are in charge and thus are responsible. There was no way the shutdown was going to last through thanksgiving - US folks going hungry and folks working for free and generally no air travel would have spelled a political nightmare for the republicans and democrats alike as anger would hit a critical point. The democrats can play this off as folding as a act of compassion; the \"pain\" of the shutdown that was caused had the admin making an active effort to worsen it while the democrats merely sat back and let it burn. \"We care about jobs\"+\"We are going to lay-off public servants\" is a message that is hypocritical and most common folk probably understand that. \"We don't want folk going hungry\"+ making an appeal to avoid having to find a way to pay out stuff like SNAP is of the same vein. Those were actions taken by the admin during the shutdown and for better or worse; the public see's the admin lying when they act like they didn't want it. The democrats won the optics with the common man; some of their more hardcore supporters are pissed because they \"folded\" but that only matters if your not thinking tactics. As it stands the democrats just set up a timebomb. They will be able to get their Epstien vote in time for Christmas when families are going to gather and talk to each other to move issues by word of mouth. If Thune doesn't hold the ACA vote by mid december then the democrats will be able to again point out \"We tried good faith...the republicans broke the trust\" which would be a true statement and generally if they break the trust it will worsen politics. If the vote passes and Trump veto's it \"You all get higher healthcare costs for Christmas\" the ad writes itself. If they vote no then the ad will be similar. Regardless in January they will shutdown the government again and let it ride out longer so that it will be fresh in folks minds for the mid-terms. Thats the tactic; the democrats are setting the republicans up and folks are dancing in the street because they \"pwned\" the dems; but celebrating has been a weakness of MAGA for awhile as its developing a bad habit of denying reality for optics. permalink parent award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 2 points 1 day ago So, let me break this down. The 39 day humiliation of the Democrats doesn't matter because at the end of the day, they will pwn the GOP? Tell me how that makes sense considering for the 45 years I have been into politics, the Democrats take great pride in beating GOP ass with great regularity. Why go through the whole Kabuki theater when you can just bitch slap your opponent and get them back in line and why would Democrats allow this humiliation? Sorry Fren, knowing Democrats as I do they would never allow this to happen. They hate us too much to play fuck fuck games like that. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 1 day ago Totally fair. The 39 days pushed the fear into public light; up until that point most economic concerns were fringe and no one was considering it - those that could afford stuff continued to do so; suddenly you had threats of food riots and suddenly the planes were not all running; the common folk couldn't ignore it anymore and since the republicans had already declared victory and being in control; regardless of the fact the dems triggered the shutdown; in Trumps own words its the presidents fault. Reality is that the democrats really do have very little power; they are essentially an air-bubble in the circulatory system of the admin; the shutdown was a very mild stroke. The democrats don't need to \"look good\" as they are largely out of the public limelight - the news is pretty much wall to wall republicans right now. That means the democrats got the advantage of not needing to \"do\" anything; they merely need to high light when those republicans fuck up and make a potential republican failing snowball into something worse. What your seeing now I am convinced is a retreat to draw republicans into a killbox. If the republicans take the bait its going to be even worse; but regardless the republicans have no choice now but to persue. If Trump vetos the ACA..dems get credit; if ACA passes; dems get credit; if the ACA dies on the floor republicans get the blame in time for Christmas and come january your right back in a fresh shutdown that will run a month or two so its in folks minds when the midterm discussions start. I hope your right; but there is no logic to the democrats suddenly permitting the lights going back on to get the stuff they had already been offered; the fillibuster threat was not big enough as even the republicans don't got a stomach for it and the optics about SNAP already being the admins fault was laid out. I would not underestimate the democrats on this..2+2 is equalling up to 5 and so something is missing here. permalink parent award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 1 points 1 day ago I am most certainly not underestimating the Democrats which is why I am wondering how you came up with this theory. Since the 1970's, the Democrats haven't had to do a thing to get their way. It was always... Step 1. Decide they want something Step 2. Anticipate GOP resistance and bitch slap them Step 3. Have the Big 3, The NY Times and Washington Post all do \"hard hitting expose's\" on Republican cruelty and inability to be bi-partisan Step 4. Watch GOP surrender so as to look bi-partisan Step 5. Get what they want and give the GOP the finger as they win again. There was no need to do this 39 day Kabuki Theater thing, they have the GOP in a pillbox whenever they want them. They did not have to humiliate themselves to get this. No sir, this is a legitimate loss by the Dems and to give them credit for anything else is a grave disservice. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

Even if it\u2019s not as deep as \u201cdeep state honeypot/containment\u201d - like even if we just accept at face value that this is an open discussion forum - there\u2019s a lot of morons who can\u2019t think for themselves. They can\u2019t analyze what\u2019s happening and change their opinion. Cock gobbling, ball jugglers. Fuck the government. permalink parent award report block reply KekistaniMemeLord 0 points 1 day ago Neither of you spoke the truth lmfao.

All the chaos with Trump and his persecution by deep state. Show? Theater? If he was truly in on it, why raid his home? It makes me wonder if deep state, with all their ways, has some sort of nuclear scenario that Trump is treading around. permalink parent award report block reply KekistaniMemeLord 0 points 1 day ago The reason Trump is so popular and that MAGA/America First has become a juggernaut is precisely because Trump ISN'T one of them.

People's attention is too scattered now, so they focus on TV for the boomers and podcasts with high female audiences and manufacture the drama for the lib narrative. This naturally creates a counter-drama in other spaces like Twitter, and oh, by the way - they actually did drag a lot of people along for the ride this time to amp it all up by forcing a lot of $ to stop for a month. So, they did get people talking, but still weren't able to move the needle in public opinion. permalink parent award report block reply Trump43v3r 1 points 1 day ago Insightful response, I\u2019ll keep my mind open.

You can't out of one side of your mouth say the Dems want to put Trump in jail or flat out assassinate him and then out of the other side of your mouth say they were all in on it. It just doesn't match reality. I remember the days when Tom Daschle would drive up to the Reagan White House in a hearse to pick up the Presidents budget as a symbolic gesture that it will be dead on arrival. No, the Democrats discovered this one time that they lose when Republicans grow a spine. Anyone who has been following politics for more than a week knows the Democrats did not want to learn that lesson. They much prefer it when they smack the Republicans in the head, the Republican cowers in fear and the Dems do whatever they want. Being told no for 39 days was definitely not in their playbook.

Firstly Trump isn't perfect; I think part of the problem is generally frustration on both sides. The whiners are frustrated because they see legit issues of the agenda discarded or seemingly ignored. Once Trump took power suddenly he didn't care about Epstien; other issues he has tried to generally gaslight the public on and so; the whiners whine. They are the canaries in the coal mine and its frustrating to tell the kid to stop touching the hot stove and burning himself and yet he insists its fine. On the flip side the cheerleaders are believing that any claim to the counter of Trumps spin is somehow an attempt to undermine the administration - they hate when something a legit win is spun as a loss (deportation numbers for example). They cannot see anyway to get the whiners to see things how they see them. Both sides have legit concerns; but as far as impact - the whiners arguments only work if you follow up on them and can verify the facts. If you see someone whine; in a few cases you can verify that the whine is something that is actually happening - regardless of what the admin is saying. No one things 50 year mortgages to flood the market with more debt and jacking up the price of housing is a good idea - the fact Trump is in real-estate means I have to assume he knows some basic economic facts about how housing prices are. I won't rant about the constant deflection of the job market claims. If the whiners are ignored and the gaslighting is welcomed - then MAGA will be having a party in the big tent while the democrats set fire to it outside - the whiners are warning you of the enemy movements and the gaps in the defenses and positive thinking or not having a solution is not going to improve that situation. Its hard because frankly everyone is moving toward the \"I don't want to hear it\" mindset and its unhealthy for MAGA if its serious about actually fixing the USA. The shutdown is a prime example. I don't think the democrats lost this one; end of the day most public sentiment was that republicans are in charge and thus are responsible. There was no way the shutdown was going to last through thanksgiving - US folks going hungry and folks working for free and generally no air travel would have spelled a political nightmare for the republicans and democrats alike as anger would hit a critical point. The democrats can play this off as folding as a act of compassion; the \"pain\" of the shutdown that was caused had the admin making an active effort to worsen it while the democrats merely sat back and let it burn. \"We care about jobs\"+\"We are going to lay-off public servants\" is a message that is hypocritical and most common folk probably understand that. \"We don't want folk going hungry\"+ making an appeal to avoid having to find a way to pay out stuff like SNAP is of the same vein. Those were actions taken by the admin during the shutdown and for better or worse; the public see's the admin lying when they act like they didn't want it. The democrats won the optics with the common man; some of their more hardcore supporters are pissed because they \"folded\" but that only matters if your not thinking tactics. As it stands the democrats just set up a timebomb. They will be able to get their Epstien vote in time for Christmas when families are going to gather and talk to each other to move issues by word of mouth. If Thune doesn't hold the ACA vote by mid december then the democrats will be able to again point out \"We tried good faith...the republicans broke the trust\" which would be a true statement and generally if they break the trust it will worsen politics. If the vote passes and Trump veto's it \"You all get higher healthcare costs for Christmas\" the ad writes itself. If they vote no then the ad will be similar. Regardless in January they will shutdown the government again and let it ride out longer so that it will be fresh in folks minds for the mid-terms. Thats the tactic; the democrats are setting the republicans up and folks are dancing in the street because they \"pwned\" the dems; but celebrating has been a weakness of MAGA for awhile as its developing a bad habit of denying reality for optics. permalink parent award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 2 points 1 day ago So, let me break this down. The 39 day humiliation of the Democrats doesn't matter because at the end of the day, they will pwn the GOP? Tell me how that makes sense considering for the 45 years I have been into politics, the Democrats take great pride in beating GOP ass with great regularity. Why go through the whole Kabuki theater when you can just bitch slap your opponent and get them back in line and why would Democrats allow this humiliation? Sorry Fren, knowing Democrats as I do they would never allow this to happen. They hate us too much to play fuck fuck games like that. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 1 day ago Totally fair. The 39 days pushed the fear into public light; up until that point most economic concerns were fringe and no one was considering it - those that could afford stuff continued to do so; suddenly you had threats of food riots and suddenly the planes were not all running; the common folk couldn't ignore it anymore and since the republicans had already declared victory and being in control; regardless of the fact the dems triggered the shutdown; in Trumps own words its the presidents fault. Reality is that the democrats really do have very little power; they are essentially an air-bubble in the circulatory system of the admin; the shutdown was a very mild stroke. The democrats don't need to \"look good\" as they are largely out of the public limelight - the news is pretty much wall to wall republicans right now. That means the democrats got the advantage of not needing to \"do\" anything; they merely need to high light when those republicans fuck up and make a potential republican failing snowball into something worse. What your seeing now I am convinced is a retreat to draw republicans into a killbox. If the republicans take the bait its going to be even worse; but regardless the republicans have no choice now but to persue. If Trump vetos the ACA..dems get credit; if ACA passes; dems get credit; if the ACA dies on the floor republicans get the blame in time for Christmas and come january your right back in a fresh shutdown that will run a month or two so its in folks minds when the midterm discussions start. I hope your right; but there is no logic to the democrats suddenly permitting the lights going back on to get the stuff they had already been offered; the fillibuster threat was not big enough as even the republicans don't got a stomach for it and the optics about SNAP already being the admins fault was laid out. I would not underestimate the democrats on this..2+2 is equalling up to 5 and so something is missing here. permalink parent award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 1 points 1 day ago I am most certainly not underestimating the Democrats which is why I am wondering how you came up with this theory. Since the 1970's, the Democrats haven't had to do a thing to get their way. It was always... Step 1. Decide they want something Step 2. Anticipate GOP resistance and bitch slap them Step 3. Have the Big 3, The NY Times and Washington Post all do \"hard hitting expose's\" on Republican cruelty and inability to be bi-partisan Step 4. Watch GOP surrender so as to look bi-partisan Step 5. Get what they want and give the GOP the finger as they win again. There was no need to do this 39 day Kabuki Theater thing, they have the GOP in a pillbox whenever they want them. They did not have to humiliate themselves to get this. No sir, this is a legitimate loss by the Dems and to give them credit for anything else is a grave disservice. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...

I won't rant about the constant deflection of the job market claims. If the whiners are ignored and the gaslighting is welcomed - then MAGA will be having a party in the big tent while the democrats set fire to it outside - the whiners are warning you of the enemy movements and the gaps in the defenses and positive thinking or not having a solution is not going to improve that situation. Its hard because frankly everyone is moving toward the \"I don't want to hear it\" mindset and its unhealthy for MAGA if its serious about actually fixing the USA. The shutdown is a prime example. I don't think the democrats lost this one; end of the day most public sentiment was that republicans are in charge and thus are responsible. There was no way the shutdown was going to last through thanksgiving - US folks going hungry and folks working for free and generally no air travel would have spelled a political nightmare for the republicans and democrats alike as anger would hit a critical point. The democrats can play this off as folding as a act of compassion; the \"pain\" of the shutdown that was caused had the admin making an active effort to worsen it while the democrats merely sat back and let it burn. \"We care about jobs\"+\"We are going to lay-off public servants\" is a message that is hypocritical and most common folk probably understand that. \"We don't want folk going hungry\"+ making an appeal to avoid having to find a way to pay out stuff like SNAP is of the same vein. Those were actions taken by the admin during the shutdown and for better or worse; the public see's the admin lying when they act like they didn't want it. The democrats won the optics with the common man; some of their more hardcore supporters are pissed because they \"folded\" but that only matters if your not thinking tactics. As it stands the democrats just set up a timebomb. They will be able to get their Epstien vote in time for Christmas when families are going to gather and talk to each other to move issues by word of mouth. If Thune doesn't hold the ACA vote by mid december then the democrats will be able to again point out \"We tried good faith...the republicans broke the trust\" which would be a true statement and generally if they break the trust it will worsen politics. If the vote passes and Trump veto's it \"You all get higher healthcare costs for Christmas\" the ad writes itself. If they vote no then the ad will be similar. Regardless in January they will shutdown the government again and let it ride out longer so that it will be fresh in folks minds for the mid-terms. Thats the tactic; the democrats are setting the republicans up and folks are dancing in the street because they \"pwned\" the dems; but celebrating has been a weakness of MAGA for awhile as its developing a bad habit of denying reality for optics. permalink parent award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 2 points 1 day ago So, let me break this down. The 39 day humiliation of the Democrats doesn't matter because at the end of the day, they will pwn the GOP? Tell me how that makes sense considering for the 45 years I have been into politics, the Democrats take great pride in beating GOP ass with great regularity. Why go through the whole Kabuki theater when you can just bitch slap your opponent and get them back in line and why would Democrats allow this humiliation? Sorry Fren, knowing Democrats as I do they would never allow this to happen. They hate us too much to play fuck fuck games like that. permalink parent award report block reply Klaus73 1 points 1 day ago Totally fair. The 39 days pushed the fear into public light; up until that point most economic concerns were fringe and no one was considering it - those that could afford stuff continued to do so; suddenly you had threats of food riots and suddenly the planes were not all running; the common folk couldn't ignore it anymore and since the republicans had already declared victory and being in control; regardless of the fact the dems triggered the shutdown; in Trumps own words its the presidents fault. Reality is that the democrats really do have very little power; they are essentially an air-bubble in the circulatory system of the admin; the shutdown was a very mild stroke. The democrats don't need to \"look good\" as they are largely out of the public limelight - the news is pretty much wall to wall republicans right now. That means the democrats got the advantage of not needing to \"do\" anything; they merely need to high light when those republicans fuck up and make a potential republican failing snowball into something worse. What your seeing now I am convinced is a retreat to draw republicans into a killbox. If the republicans take the bait its going to be even worse; but regardless the republicans have no choice now but to persue. If Trump vetos the ACA..dems get credit; if ACA passes; dems get credit; if the ACA dies on the floor republicans get the blame in time for Christmas and come january your right back in a fresh shutdown that will run a month or two so its in folks minds when the midterm discussions start. I hope your right; but there is no logic to the democrats suddenly permitting the lights going back on to get the stuff they had already been offered; the fillibuster threat was not big enough as even the republicans don't got a stomach for it and the optics about SNAP already being the admins fault was laid out. I would not underestimate the democrats on this..2+2 is equalling up to 5 and so something is missing here. permalink parent award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 1 points 1 day ago I am most certainly not underestimating the Democrats which is why I am wondering how you came up with this theory. Since the 1970's, the Democrats haven't had to do a thing to get their way. It was always... Step 1. Decide they want something Step 2. Anticipate GOP resistance and bitch slap them Step 3. Have the Big 3, The NY Times and Washington Post all do \"hard hitting expose's\" on Republican cruelty and inability to be bi-partisan Step 4. Watch GOP surrender so as to look bi-partisan Step 5. Get what they want and give the GOP the finger as they win again. There was no need to do this 39 day Kabuki Theater thing, they have the GOP in a pillbox whenever they want them. They did not have to humiliate themselves to get this. No sir, this is a legitimate loss by the Dems and to give them credit for anything else is a grave disservice. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...\nConsrvspkgNJ 2 points 1 day ago So, let me break this down.

All the chaos with Trump and his persecution by deep state. Show? Theater? If he was truly in on it, why raid his home? It makes me wonder if deep state, with all their ways, has some sort of nuclear scenario that Trump is treading around. permalink parent award report block reply KekistaniMemeLord 0 points 1 day ago The reason Trump is so popular and that MAGA/America First has become a juggernaut is precisely because Trump ISN'T one of them.

Notice how everything is permitted here except noticing that everyone in government is on the same team and who controls that team. permalink parent award report block reply kyle6969 1 points 1 day ago For sure - who gives a fuck about downvotes. Learned long ago not to care about that. Even if it\u2019s not as deep as \u201cdeep state honeypot/containment\u201d - like even if we just accept at face value that this is an open discussion forum - there\u2019s a lot of morons who can\u2019t think for themselves.

They will do the same for the midterms. permalink award report block reply\nCalumet57 1 points 1 day ago here come the socialists permalink award report block reply\nJoinTheDiscussion 1 points 15 hours ago Schumer caved just in time so the Republicans couldn't invoke the filibuster..
