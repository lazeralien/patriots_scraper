Be it israel for not spewing their propaganda to the DS who were scared of Kirks message 3 wks before his death where he said at a TPUSA event that he'd run a nationwide campaign to primary RINOs. They knew damn good and well if someone as powerful as him were serious their entire house of cards would be wrecked for good. I think it has a lot to do with his message 3 wks before his death, and thats why the FBI is doing FBI things and covering it up. I truly believe this. permalink parent award report block reply view 10 more comments... deleted 14 points 5 days ago view 5 more comments...

She's been bat shit crazy for years already, but this one takes the cake. I hope TPUSA and Charlie Kirks widow sue the shit out of her over these claims.  Either she has to produce something legitimate and substantial to back up her crazy ass claims or she doesn't and TPUSA and the Kirk family take every penny she has and she shuts up once for all about it. Either way, all this conspiracy bullshit over Charlie Kirk's assassination is settled. permalink parent award report block reply view 7 more comments... load 13 more comments...

And it wouldn't surprise me if Bitcoin also was. permalink parent award report block reply IHaveABetterSolution 7 points 5 days ago The internet was solid through the most of the 2000's. The female user demographic started blooming and everything went downhill from there. Reddit didn't used to be 120% fake and gay. Agreed social media started fucking with things, and providing a driver for female adoption. But old school gen 1 & 2 forums with 95% - +99% anonymous male userbases, much like this one, were and still are one of the last bastions. permalink parent award report block reply Grindelwald 2 points 5 days ago Agree.  I was involved in a few at the start and noticed that a good majority of second level domain names were porn at the beginning.  A lot of hoarding of names without being used.  There was a secondary market for popular names.  But it was the Wild West for schemers. permalink parent award report block reply BadManOrange 1 points 5 days ago In the old days, the furthest girls got on the Internet was AOL. The real internet was for nerdy guys doing silly shit. Sad that those days are gone. permalink parent award report block reply ScarlettOMaga 1 points 5 days ago I agree with what you're implying, BUT, before 911 we did hear of Saddam and how bad he was, and those of us who are older, we were aware of the Iran issues decades ago. Neither was a huge deal that was talked about much anymore. So, overall, I agree and it's disgusting. Oh and Jews? Nothing talked about other than the holocaust occasionally or movies or mutual jokes. permalink parent award report block reply HumblePepe 11 points 5 days ago I'm convinced we are in the period of the last generation to support Israel with the boomers finally making their exit. permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 4 points 5 days ago Demographics is destiny and it seems the younger generations are all in with the America first mindset. permalink parent award report block reply rebuildingMyself 3 points 5 days ago Or America Last mindset depending on which side of Karl Marx were talking about, but that side is no fan of Israel either (because they prefer their Muslim overlords instead) permalink parent award report block reply GA_Logic 2 points 5 days ago Well the zionists use Muslims as useful idiots in creating the worst case scenario and then offering a better choice which is still a false choice because you are surrendering your sovereignty either way to Muslims or Zionists that do not respect Western values.  The globohomos fund and create the problem ala UK and Europe Islamification and then offer the solution with is full on techno authoritarianism eg digital ID to solve the problem. When it is not about choice A or B but there is also a choice C, D, E, F, etc. permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 1 points 5 days ago Lol... its not the America First mindset. The newcomers have merely learnt to pivot America to their own countries now. They will absolutely pivot them towards South Asia. It was an Indian banker that was funding the British Empire at its height. These relationships haven't dissapeared. They've merely moved and it seems they harnessing these powers again. permalink parent award report block reply ScarlettOMaga 2 points 5 days ago I think so too. And even with Gen X, many of us are sick of the Israel nonsense. I'm not sure on the percentages, but everyone I know in my generation of X is fed up as well. The Silent Generation is on its way out (my parents) and they are mostly supportive of Israel, but at least my mother sees the issues. I think they are more based than Boomers. Edit: clarity I hope permalink parent award report block reply Electrify928 2 points 5 days ago Lot's of MAGA also are tired of people's obsession with Isreal and Jewish people too. Like the lefts obsession with race and gender. If you cant see the parallels then you just might be radicalized too sadly. permalink parent award report block reply Lol_Garrus 1 points 5 days ago Well, that's resentment building. I personally don't care about Jews or Israel one way or another. The \"REEEEEEE, IT'S TEH JOOOS!\" crowd is fringe. The mainstream, especially in the GOP, is that Israel is our greatest ally and they must be supported, criticism of this is anti-semitism! (Which is actually more in line with how radical left lovbies like BLM operate) It's that action that builds resentment. Tucker Carlson for example hasn't said anything about hating jews, just calling out factual patterns. Calling out patterns is deemed anti-semitic, including Israel's significant emphasis in our politics. Right now, many right wing youth are asking, \"Why is Israel so dominant in our politics and why do they get so much money?\" in good faith I will add. But the more the MIGA crowd and Jews on Twitter bash them, and their voices, for asking those questions; that will turn the \"Why is this?\" into \"Fuck you!\" permalink parent award report block reply Neo2025 OP -51 points 5 days ago Nope. It's actually the \"Israel is behind EVERYTHING\" crowd, which has lost any credibility, or support. permalink parent award report block reply CandyBarr 25 points 5 days ago So tell me something Israel is not behind. Lets start with what they are\nPorn, trannies,LGBT, immigration, feminism, usury. I agree they are not behind EVERYTHING but you'd have to be really dumb or disingenuous to realize they are not behind most of our biggest complaints That's the problem with ziodiggers.

Whew doggie you are a right wing militant you don't even know it yet. Masonry was started in part so Jewish people could worship in England when their practices were banned multiple times.

Just go to bitchute.com and watch some videos.  You'll get the truth there. Search Erika Kirk, her missionary Romanian Angels, both of her parents who worked for the goverment and especially her mother with ties to Israel working on defense systems for the Iron Dome, Charlie's Isreali security team, the one on the team who pushed a remote trigger on his arm, the stand down of EMS, Charlie's text messages, etc.  Pro-Zionists are trying to silence Candace and Tucker because they are trying to get truth out.  Some have recipts because they know people directly involved such as whitehat donors, so believe them. There's also a whistleblower from TPUSA who is speaking out.  It might open your eyes as to why Israel killed him.  Don't let people gaslight you on this site.  You know what you saw and what you've been seeing ... and if your gut is telling you something doesn't seem right, that's because it isn't.

Cool story faggot. permalink parent award report block reply Spawnlingman 8 points 5 days ago Posting on this site that TPUSA\\Isreal took out Charlie Kirk will get it removed as quickly as posting that you're MAGA on Reddit.  Maybe a little faster honestly.    It's been almost entirely snuffed out here, expertly.    Why this is stickied this morning makes me think something is about to turn. permalink award report block reply PeeOnPelosi 7 points 5 days ago Fuck Israel and all jews permalink award report block reply Roadpower 7 points 5 days ago The claimed details of murder of Charlie Kirk do not add up. In fact numerous details outright defy reality just like we saw with 9/11. If people choose to allow themselves to be gas-lit then that is on them. I for one call bullshit on official narratives that don't comport with physics or basic investigative standards. permalink award report block reply loveshock 7 points 5 days ago Nothing wrong with noticing. Why can't half our leaders say on record that they are for Americans before Israel?  Why do NYC mayoral candidates run on claims of going to Israel after getting elected instead of doing things in NYC for their voters?  Why is there 7 Israel flags behind a Texas Governor speaking to the press?  Why is anyone who points this stuff out is attacked and ridiculed and flamed? What if some of Charlie's closest \"friends\" were in on it?  What it it wasn't actually a dumb faggy college kid who took the shot and the FBI obviously created a nonsensical fake story about and it was done by someone else?  Wouldn't you want to know what actually happened?  Do you actually care???  Wouldn't Charlie want the truth exposed? permalink award report block reply gustodog 7 points 5 days ago Reminder that Israel Firsters used to be Never Trump-ers. The fact that scum like you are trying to smear her for asking valid questions about the murder of her friend, and pointing out lies, shows that she's over the target. There is so much that's suspicious about Kirk's assassination. Given the way Israel and the FBI operate, and given that Kirk had stopped obeying Zionist donors, it's entirely possible they orchestrated it and are trying to cover it up. permalink award report block reply stillbringingitback 6 points 5 days ago Turns out there\u2019s a lot to hate about Jews and that\u2019s just that.  Whether or not Candace is right, I guess time will tell. I\u2019m sick of Jews always pretending like it\u2019s such a goddamn mystery why so many find them reprehensible.  As if it\u2019s some goddamn conspiracy and we\u2019re all on on it lol.  What a joke.  Godspeed Candace. permalink award report block reply Monzie 6 points 5 days ago The entire situation looks like a manufactured event. Nothing says \"lone shooter\" about this killing. permalink award report block reply hannahb 6 points 5 days ago Nothing she said was off base here. Someone inside of Turning Point could've absolutely had some involvement. In cases like this, you should explore all the possibilities. What if the events coordinator had no idea about a nefarious plot, but accepted a $100k bribe in order to make that campus the first stop and add it to the itinerary. Maybe under the guise of a 'rich donor' who really wanted it to happen in his hometown. permalink award report block reply Brandon1776 6 points 5 days ago With a face like that, im sure she isn't isreal first..... permalink award report block reply Cuomorbidities 3 points 5 days ago She\u2019s a former \u201cactress\u201d from Hollywood soooooo\u2026..must be a pro-Amish activist lol permalink parent award report block reply KlEpto_CaponE 5 points 5 days ago Is this post sponsored by AIPAC? permalink award report block reply ExorcistCandy 5 points 5 days ago Hats working hard on this board permalink award report block reply UltraMagaWA 5 points 5 days ago You'll know who your enemy is by who you are not allowed to criticize permalink award report block reply stagolee 5 points 5 days ago Are we to assume that this influential political movement wasn\u2019t infiltrated by intelligence services?  It\u2019s literally their bread and butter to do this.  I\u2019d be more surprised if that wasn\u2019t going on. I\u2019m not going to pretend everyone working at TPUSA is a saint just because I feel bad for them.  I guarantee there are bad actors inside the org, regardless of whether or not they were involved in the assassination.  Look at what happened with James O\u2019Keefe, and he wasn\u2019t nearly as important as Charlie. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum 1 points 5 days ago I'm under the assumption intelligence services have infiltrated THIS SITE. That said, they'd have to hide from Charley because he had a world class BS detector. permalink parent award report block reply stagolee 1 points 5 days ago You would\u2019ve thought the same about O\u2019Keefe.  CIA and Mossad have world class infiltrators and they\u2019ve been doing it a long time. permalink parent award report block reply Crappydatum 1 points 5 days ago O'Keefe KNEW they were crooked, but he was given horrific advice by legal.

Under laws like California Penal Code \u00a7135 PC and similar statutes nationwide, willfully destroying, concealing, or altering evidence relevant to an investigation is a criminal offense\u2014typically a misdemeanor, but serious in nature. Key legal points: The act must be willful and intended to obstruct justice.\nIf law enforcement has not yet secured the scene, removing potential evidence (like a camera or SD card) before handing it over raises legal concerns.\nEven private individuals can be charged with evidence tampering or obstruction of justice if they interfere with critical evidence.\nIn the case of Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination, video shows a Turning Point USA staff member removing the camera and SD card. While the organization has not explained this action, no charges have been filed related to evidence tampering as of now. The FBI has not confirmed whether the footage was surrendered. Until authorities determine whether the evidence was preserved and submitted, the legality of the removal remains under scrutiny. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum -1 points 5 days ago Maybe, just maybe, they didn't want garish bloody photos of their friend getting out (because we all know SOMEONE at the police side would release it). However, that said, if the police demand it via court order or whatever, they'll have to give it up, but Now it's much more difficult for some low level employee to release it.

All Brigitte had to do was issue a statement that she was born female and that would have been the end of it. Why? Because if Candace had continued the accusations the public would have turned on her. \"Why can't she just leave that poor woman in peace?\" But instead the Macrons pay their lawyers to dance around that core issue and instead pick on trivial errors they allege Owens made in her search.  \"No, Owens is wrong about Brigette being 5'8\"!

Bernie Sanders, Rashida Tlaib, Cori Bush, AOC, Ilhan Omar all refuse AIPAC funds. Joe Biden on the other hand was the top recipient of Israel funds over 34 years as a Senator. And then MTG is pro-illegal immigration and Massie tried to tank the bill that reduced government spending.

Same thing. permalink award report block reply fatboyslim -4 points 5 days ago Candace just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Candace\u2019s entire persona is built on being a super sleuth, and that everything is a conspiracy theory. How many different theories has she thrown out in the weeks since Kirk\u2019s assassination? Conservatives largely have a strong distrust of the government and the media (rightfully so). Candace is cognizant of this, of course. And she\u2019s cognizant that conservatives largely question \u201cofficial\u201d narratives surrounding major events. She ratchets that skepticism and distrust up to 1000, and draws in eyeballs, clicks (and revenue) by continually pedaling whatever outlandish idea that lands in her lap or pops into her head. Questioning things is good. Distrusting the government and media is good. Candace will peddle shocking accusations because it\u2019ll get her eyeballs and clicks\u2026she doesn\u2019t actually give a shit about the \u201ctruth\u201d. I think there\u2019s a lot of weirdness surrounding Kirk\u2019s assassination, and it would not shock me at all that it goes deeper than just some trans-loving lunatic shooting him. But man\u2026I\u2019m pretty damn tired of Candace\u2019s shtick.

I heard the shot.  Saw it as it happened. Heard it clearly.  It was a large round Hunting rifle shot.  Very unique. To imagine 2 shots were fired - is moronic. We have tons of video of the sodomite running from the scene IMMEDIATELY after the shot.   Jumping from a roof. The rifle IS a family gun - it can be taken apart with the right tool. He admits to the shot and killing Charlie - admitted this to multiple people .  He is also gay and clearly mentally damaged even for a 4.0 GPA student. He would never have admitted to killing Charlie - if he did not do it. But that fact that he pulled the trigger DOES NOT MEAN OTHER PEOPLE DID NOT TRICK/INFLUENCE  HIM IN TO DOING THIS.  The Motive he gave is not enough right now. He says he hated Charlie immensely - but never 'riles against him'... does not go on long form insults - where is all the ONLINE HATE COMMENTS...etc in his writing.  That is missing as far as I am concerned. I am going to make a guess here - but some Nefarious Groups online - found him Online perhaps a year ago - and started feeding him all the one sided Charlie Comments about homos and gays... which slowly cooked his mind - and you toss in his gay sodomite friend - and you make him into a shooter. He also stated that 'an opportunity' came and he was going to take it.  BUT HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING CHARLIE ONLINE as far as I know... he did not get that opportunity himself...he was not paying that kind of attention to Charlie Kirk... 'SO SOMEONE ELSE GAVE HIM THE DETAILS OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.'  the where (250 miles from his home), the when, the how (the place on the roof and how to get there so easily - as if he knew), ... those details all had to come from someone else. (unless I am missing something) FIND THAT PERSON/GROUP - AND YOU WILL FIND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIRK MURDER.  Who nose? permalink parent award report block reply Tyndel 3 points 5 days ago The rifle wasn't taken apart it was in his hand when he was getting down from the roof but as we learned in the Kenosha Kids trial, video is automatically smoothed and things that are small are sometimes artifacted in and out.  Slow the video of him jumping off the roof down and you will see the rifle barrel in certain frames. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 2 points 5 days ago I agree he had the rifle - but it was very difficult to see. I would imagine running across campus with a rifle in your hand is not a good look and could lead to capture 'by anyone.' It did appear to me - that I could not see the stock -but did see the barrel or something like it when he dropped something to the grass before jumping. Either way - I believe he pulled the trigger - but I think he was manipulated/accelerated by some Online group - that put all the pieces together for him. permalink parent award report block reply LuvTheSmellofFreedom 2 points 5 days ago He's the patsy. conveniently found like Oswald.  But also like Dallas and JFK, Oswald too was groomed, but there were multiple shooters (no magic bullets sorry). I also listened to the sound as best I could of the Kirk shooting.  Sounded more like a lighter round, 30-6 echo's for a while, has a lower vibration so it goes farther. If you ever been hunting, you know the sound a few hundred yards away for sure. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 1 points 5 days ago That crack' is unmistakable. There is no other story to tell - he pulled the trigger and ran... he is a sodomite  gamer... not a 'trained operative' - permalink parent award report block reply DeltaSierra 0 points 5 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 2 points 5 days ago In a way - it matches up with ... James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old left-wing 'Bernie' activist from Belleville, Illinois, carried out a mass shooting on June 14, 2017, during a Republican Congressmen baseball practice  for the annual Congressional Baseball Game in Alexandria, Virginia. the FBI later classified the incident as an act of domestic terrorism, with Hodgkinson identified as a \"domestic violent extremist\" with a \"personalized violent ideology\". It was reported that Hodgkision watched MSNBC constantly and read the NYTs constantly ...  literally being brainwashed to attack Republicans.  He used key phrases like \"Trump is not my President\" and \"Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy.\" The MEDIA did that one. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...

They knew damn good and well if someone as powerful as him were serious their entire house of cards would be wrecked for good.

Right now, many right wing youth are asking, \"Why is Israel so dominant in our politics and why do they get so much money?\" in good faith I will add.

Just go to bitchute.com and watch some videos.  You'll get the truth there. Search Erika Kirk, her missionary Romanian Angels, both of her parents who worked for the goverment and especially her mother with ties to Israel working on defense systems for the Iron Dome, Charlie's Isreali security team, the one on the team who pushed a remote trigger on his arm, the stand down of EMS, Charlie's text messages, etc.  Pro-Zionists are trying to silence Candace and Tucker because they are trying to get truth out.  Some have recipts because they know people directly involved such as whitehat donors, so believe them. There's also a whistleblower from TPUSA who is speaking out.  It might open your eyes as to why Israel killed him.  Don't let people gaslight you on this site.  You know what you saw and what you've been seeing ... and if your gut is telling you something doesn't seem right, that's because it isn't. It didn't seem right when he got shot ... and shit certainly doesn't seem right now with certain \"greiving wives\" grabbing the back of the V.P.'s head during a close hug with tight leather pants on.

Just the fact they are lying about the shot so obviously tells me this is all bullshit. FTW. permalink award report block reply\nJBlaze056 9 points 5 days ago Charlie was starting to go against Zionism and Israel and he was then killed.  Who knows how related these things are to each other but they are both true things. permalink award report block reply YaharaRiver -3 points 5 days ago Bullshit.

I for one call bullshit on official narratives that don't comport with physics or basic investigative standards. permalink award report block reply\nloveshock 7 points 5 days ago Nothing wrong with noticing. Why can't half our leaders say on record that they are for Americans before Israel?  Why do NYC mayoral candidates run on claims of going to Israel after getting elected instead of doing things in NYC for their voters?  Why is there 7 Israel flags behind a Texas Governor speaking to the press?  Why is anyone who points this stuff out is attacked and ridiculed and flamed? What if some of Charlie's closest \"friends\" were in on it?  What it it wasn't actually a dumb faggy college kid who took the shot and the FBI obviously created a nonsensical fake story about and it was done by someone else?  Wouldn't you want to know what actually happened?  Do you actually care???  Wouldn't Charlie want the truth exposed? permalink award report block reply\ngustodog 7 points 5 days ago Reminder that Israel Firsters used to be Never Trump-ers. The fact that scum like you are trying to smear her for asking valid questions about the murder of her friend, and pointing out lies, shows that she's over the target. There is so much that's suspicious about Kirk's assassination. Given the way Israel and the FBI operate, and given that Kirk had stopped obeying Zionist donors, it's entirely possible they orchestrated it and are trying to cover it up. permalink award report block reply\nstillbringingitback 6 points 5 days ago Turns out there\u2019s a lot to hate about Jews and that\u2019s just that.

Under laws like California Penal Code \u00a7135 PC and similar statutes nationwide, willfully destroying, concealing, or altering evidence relevant to an investigation is a criminal offense\u2014typically a misdemeanor, but serious in nature. Key legal points: The act must be willful and intended to obstruct justice.\nIf law enforcement has not yet secured the scene, removing potential evidence (like a camera or SD card) before handing it over raises legal concerns.\nEven private individuals can be charged with evidence tampering or obstruction of justice if they interfere with critical evidence.\nIn the case of Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination, video shows a Turning Point USA staff member removing the camera and SD card. While the organization has not explained this action, no charges have been filed related to evidence tampering as of now. The FBI has not confirmed whether the footage was surrendered. Until authorities determine whether the evidence was preserved and submitted, the legality of the removal remains under scrutiny. permalink award report block reply Crappydatum -1 points 5 days ago Maybe, just maybe, they didn't want garish bloody photos of their friend getting out (because we all know SOMEONE at the police side would release it).

Candace\u2019s entire persona is built on being a super sleuth, and that everything is a conspiracy theory. How many different theories has she thrown out in the weeks since Kirk\u2019s assassination? Conservatives largely have a strong distrust of the government and the media (rightfully so). Candace is cognizant of this, of course. And she\u2019s cognizant that conservatives largely question \u201cofficial\u201d narratives surrounding major events. She ratchets that skepticism and distrust up to 1000, and draws in eyeballs, clicks (and revenue) by continually pedaling whatever outlandish idea that lands in her lap or pops into her head. Questioning things is good. Distrusting the government and media is good. Candace will peddle shocking accusations because it\u2019ll get her eyeballs and clicks\u2026she doesn\u2019t actually give a shit about the \u201ctruth\u201d. I think there\u2019s a lot of weirdness surrounding Kirk\u2019s assassination, and it would not shock me at all that it goes deeper than just some trans-loving lunatic shooting him. But man\u2026I\u2019m pretty damn tired of Candace\u2019s shtick.

But I think it speaks to a deeper problem.... The opinion of the \"masses\" are continually manipulated for Globalist purposes. They do this by embedding talking heads and demagogues, into growing political movements, then try to manipulate those movements through the talking heads and grifters they install.

I heard the shot.  Saw it as it happened. Heard it clearly.  It was a large round Hunting rifle shot.  Very unique. To imagine 2 shots were fired - is moronic. We have tons of video of the sodomite running from the scene IMMEDIATELY after the shot.   Jumping from a roof. The rifle IS a family gun - it can be taken apart with the right tool. He admits to the shot and killing Charlie - admitted this to multiple people .  He is also gay and clearly mentally damaged even for a 4.0 GPA student. He would never have admitted to killing Charlie - if he did not do it. But that fact that he pulled the trigger DOES NOT MEAN OTHER PEOPLE DID NOT TRICK/INFLUENCE  HIM IN TO DOING THIS.  The Motive he gave is not enough right now. He says he hated Charlie immensely - but never 'riles against him'... does not go on long form insults - where is all the ONLINE HATE COMMENTS...etc in his writing.  That is missing as far as I am concerned. I am going to make a guess here - but some Nefarious Groups online - found him Online perhaps a year ago - and started feeding him all the one sided Charlie Comments about homos and gays... which slowly cooked his mind - and you toss in his gay sodomite friend - and you make him into a shooter. He also stated that 'an opportunity' came and he was going to take it.  BUT HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING CHARLIE ONLINE as far as I know... he did not get that opportunity himself...he was not paying that kind of attention to Charlie Kirk... 'SO SOMEONE ELSE GAVE HIM THE DETAILS OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.'  the where (250 miles from his home), the when, the how (the place on the roof and how to get there so easily - as if he knew), ... those details all had to come from someone else.

I would imagine running across campus with a rifle in your hand is not a good look and could lead to capture 'by anyone.'
