Notice how socialized health care done this way gives a small number of power corporations all control.  They get money from the government and funnel that into reelection campaigns basically buying the politicians.  Because health care is so expensive, people in the lower middle class choose poverty to get it for free or close to free and those in poverty can never get out.  This is socialism which is government control of everything.  This is why we have such a great split between the poor and rich right now.

Seeing_Red 25 points 3 days ago TL;DR: ChatGPT: Obamacare funnels large amounts of taxpayer money to insurance companies and big hospital systems, while ordinary people still pay high premiums, high deductibles, and inflated medical bills. It says insurance companies receive a guaranteed $40 billion a year in subsidies that aren\u2019t tied to lowering patient costs. Large \u201cnonprofit\u201d hospital networks are described as taking in over $150 billion in tax breaks and extra payments while paying executives millions, buying up smaller practices to reduce competition, and charging extreme markups for basic supplies. The overall point is that taxpayers pay multiple times: through taxes, through monthly premiums, and through hospital bills, while access to affordable care remains out of reach. The claimed beneficiaries are lawmakers, insurance companies, and hospital executives, not the patients the system was supposed to help. permalink award report block reply HockeyMom4Trump 13 points 3 days ago Sounds accurate. Our premiums are high. If we go in, we have to pay because our deductible is high. We never really feel comfortable going in for anything like a sore throat, because when we do, we get a bill for $700 plus dollars. Meanwhile, the people with no insurance in this country illegal seem to pay nothing. permalink parent award report block reply deleted 5 points 3 days ago Hanging_Chad 3 points 3 days ago Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) has a 2-star rating on Google permalink parent award report block reply DCPower 2 points 3 days ago On the other hand, I\u2019ve found an amazing amount of home remedies that work a lot better than prescription drugs. permalink parent award report block reply HillarysFUPA 15 points 3 days ago I'm friends with an anesthesiologist and he had a private practice.

They have hooks into food production, energy, technology and other areas in a slow creep toward Communist control of We the People.. permalink award report block reply trueredthruandthru 6 points 3 days ago As a doctor I can tell you that healthcare is beyond broken--from the top to the bottom. Massive fraud, constant turnover, subpar care, rules/policies broken, inflated admin salaries, small private practices being squeezed by 'non-profit' hospital orgs, essential services being dropped, and on and on...And that doesn't even scratch the surface of MASSIVE amount of illegals who get thrown on medicaid and pay literally nothing. The worst part is that the rural hospitals survive off these illegals on medicaid. So if illegals get deported or thrown off medicaid then the hospitals go bankrupt and close and the local citizens suffer big time. The stories I could tell....I've been in it for 13 years and I used to have a crazy story maybe once a month of what I saw. Now it is daily. Constant unsettling problems popping up on a daily basis. Healthcare is in big big big trouble and has been trending this way since Obamacare, and the public is just starting to notice. permalink award report block reply MonolitoVeritas 6 points 3 days ago Retirees have known for long time that the best, cheapest and fastest health care is received through cash as you go care.

You give free healthcare to those who don\u2019t try. You set the threshold for \u201creduced coverage\u201d so low that holding a job makes you ineligible working part time making $15k/yr. Make the cost of living higher than tons of people make. Make holding a job a useless venture so nobody builds a career. Get them all on government handouts. permalink award report block reply Agent_86 1 points 3 days ago Well damn. I pay 167.00 a month with 0 deductible. Soooo.... permalink award report block reply NowTheyAllLose 3 points 3 days ago Good for you.  I make $70k/yr and have a wife and 1 kid. My premium is $1,100/mo and deductible is $5k.

And I don't live in an expensive state either.... permalink parent award report block reply Michalusmichalus 2 points 2 days ago That's very good these days. The average lately seems to be -/+ 25%. The worst thing a company can do is self insure. People don't pay enough attention to that. You do NOT want your employer having access to your medical records. permalink parent award report block reply Agent_86 2 points 3 days ago I guess that's good. When my wife was alive she had bcbs.

How soon we forget: 2010 and how outraged Americans who were AWARE of the above, descended on Town Halls because they wanted to keep their private health care insurance. The Dems are still at it, and their agenda is to eliminate private health care amid current cries of how \"broken\" it is. Well, it isn't broken for everyone. My husband and I pay a reasonable premium, and are able to choose our own doctor/specialist if needed. We're certainly not the only ones in the U.S. to do so. And there's no need for the annual Obamacare clown show, where people get on line to search for a new plan. We've had the same employer plan for decades. So I'd think long and hard before getting on the \"U.S. health care is broken\" bandwagon. Unless, like us, you can afford to pay the fines you'll have to pay for not complying. Yes, that's another thing: when they started talking about fines (that Justice Roberts deemed a \"tax,\" so it was upheld) WE got busy and saved like crazy in an account dedicated to pay those fines, and to which we still contribute. Luckily, we never had to pay them. But should that scenario come around again, like all of the elites, we will also be able to pay that fine (tax) for non-compliance and, frankly, for concierge care, if necessary. NO ONE will be telling\nus what to do with regards to health care. So appreciate what you have while you have it. permalink award report block reply MajorClark 0 points 3 days ago Obama, Biden, Schumer and other corrupt politicians getting kickbacks in the millions. permalink award report block reply\nDCPower 64 points 3 days ago Summary: the government gives 40 billion to insurance companies regardless of what they do, then gives tax breaks to hospitals, adding up to roughly $200 billion.

How soon we forget: 2010 and how outraged Americans who were AWARE of the above, descended on Town Halls because they wanted to keep their private health care insurance. The Dems are still at it, and their agenda is to eliminate private health care amid current cries of how \"broken\" it is. Well, it isn't broken for everyone. My husband and I pay a reasonable premium, and are able to choose our own doctor/specialist if needed. We're certainly not the only ones in the U.S. to do so. And there's no need for the annual Obamacare clown show, where people get on line to search for a new plan. We've had the same employer plan for decades. So I'd think long and hard before getting on the \"U.S. health care is broken\" bandwagon. Unless, like us, you can afford to pay the fines you'll have to pay for not complying. Yes, that's another thing: when they started talking about fines (that Justice Roberts deemed a \"tax,\" so it was upheld) WE got busy and saved like crazy in an account dedicated to pay those fines, and to which we still contribute. Luckily, we never had to pay them. But should that scenario come around again, like all of the elites, we will also be able to pay that fine (tax) for non-compliance and, frankly, for concierge care, if necessary. NO ONE will be telling\nus what to do with regards to health care. So appreciate what you have while you have it. permalink award report block reply\nMajorClark 0 points 3 days ago Obama, Biden, Schumer and other corrupt politicians getting kickbacks in the millions. permalink award report block reply"}
