I had a CDL when I was 23. Took my test with 15 burly semi truck drivers. 6 of us passed. It was tough. Not that has anything really to do with it. I just remember how hard I studied and worked to pass that test. permalink parent award report block reply Pissonit 9 points 6 days ago I have a friend that was a truck driver his whole life. I was a diesel/ tanker trailer mechanic my entire life. Were both retired now and sometimes think back when we were young if we just would have put our talents together we could have started a trucking company together. Old news now but we may have missed the golden ring on that one.... permalink parent award report block reply Covfefebrulee 8 points 6 days ago I love trucks and I used to think truck drivers were the safest people to drive next to. I still do people like you guys some of the most amazing truckers I\u2019ve followed all the way from Montana to Alaska on the Alaska Highway for days on end and they looked out for me more than once a truck driver has reached out to make sure I\u2019m OK in my travels over the years. It\u2019s an interesting profession. I know that when my brothers and I saw smoky in the bandit we all wanted to get a CB and my dad got us one. It was awesome. In general these days, it\u2019s really hard to find good mechanics and reliable people. I remember things were different and I keep reminding myself these days that it\u2019s not the same anymore. People are just not skilled anymore. All the skilled people are retired! permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments... bratt 19 points 6 days ago Always think forfeiture!  Seize the truck and the cargo. I don't think he ever said anything about the driver being an illegal alien, but with everything missing to be a driver or the truck being licensed to be on the road, I am betting on it. permalink award report block reply HIGH_ENERGY_MEMES 4 points 6 days ago Seize the truck and the cargo. Cargo would be harsh as it would be too easy for some ordinary person to pay for delivery to an all seemingly respectable company and then lose something really valuable. If I pay for delivery but company turns around and hires this, I the sender and being frauded also, and dont deserve punishment. 100% seize truck and charge driver + anyone that hired/owned this truck. the one that really bothered me is the non licence at all, seriously.... that person needs some time in prison as they have no respect for society. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -1 points 6 days ago This screams farm use/mechanic/redneck not illegal.

White people have DLs. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -3 points 6 days ago Not necessarily on them. To have the truck you need to obtain the truck - most illegals drive for mega  carriers. permalink parent award report block reply bratt 5 points 6 days ago Farmers I would give a pass. They have 13 year old kids driving, they are local and not driving far or fast. I think farm vehicles get lots of exceptions. Combines and tractors are always on the roads. stick to the lowest common denominator I don't know what that means? permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 2 points 6 days ago For the purposes of trucking, think megacarrier dry van freight. Dont stick out, be the most \"normal\" of the profession. Trying to be abnormal gets deportations. permalink parent award report block reply bratt 1 points 6 days ago I can see that. Same rules as drug running. No speeding, common car, current plates. If they would have learned decent English, many would never be check in the first place. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 2 points 6 days ago Shouldn't be operating that on a highway. At the very least it's a blowout waiting to happen.  VIN is also a problem; very suspicious. permalink parent award report block reply HIGH_ENERGY_MEMES 2 points 6 days ago Combines and tractors are always on the roads. You see this where I am, also ATVs and kids on dirt bikes. The community has general rule you do this stuff in the valley as its rural but dont take vehicles out of it to the local town. Rural cops are pretty chill as they are part of the community and get it. Also works because people are responsible. We had one family move in that was trouble, doing burnouts everywhere and taking bikes onto other people properties type behaviour. Cops went and had a chat with them, no idea what they said but I haven't seem them take a unregistered vehicle off the property in over 18 months. Everyone else, no problem. That's the way communities should work. permalink parent award report block reply NZbacon 1 points 5 days ago Farmers don't drive enclosed semi trailers.  They're useless for farming. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 2 points 5 days ago Sure they do, dig a trench for the rear wheels and you have a cheap storage solution. permalink parent award report block reply NZbacon 2 points 5 days ago Cut a hole in the end and you've got a cheap bridge too.

They\u2019d never be able to get away with this here. This must have happened in one of those states where they issue drivers licenses with \u201cno name\u201d permalink parent award report block reply Taylor3006 16 points 6 days ago Arrest the driver, impound the truck and when the case is done, crush the truck, the trailer, and the contents.

If I had to do it now, I would take local roads all the way down and back. permalink award report block reply NY2KCMO1776 7 points 6 days ago I was taught to drive on the new jersey turnpike on the local route, with tractor trailers by Newark Airport.  MY parents forced me to get comfortable around them, never hang out in blind spots etc.  I would take the local lanes to avoid traffic and I felt comfortable because truckers were white males and predictable.   Fast forward 20 years I bought a car in kansas.  Almost had one run me off the road week one.  Saw multiple tractors on the left lane not passing, lots of ghetto and 3rd world drivers.  Trucks are cutting people off as if they are in an Altima.  Now I avoid trucks at all costs.  Inevitably I get stuck behind some jackass in the left lane just cruising along in the blind spot of a truck not even attempting to pass.  I back off, got to the right and pass them off.  Drive in 35 in kansas or 70 and you see it all Day. permalink parent award report block reply KilroyJCNJ 1 points 4 days ago 14 to 7A and back was fun.

They gave him half a point for being late and their stupid ass  response to what happened was \"maybe you should leave earlier for work\"\nThere's only one way in and out. We are on a dead end road. He said he called DOT and he won't stop until something is done. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 5 days ago My last job has a disciplinary system like that, and on top of it they give out written warnings for attendance like candy.

You see this where I am, also ATVs and kids on dirt bikes. The community has general rule you do this stuff in the valley as its rural but dont take vehicles out of it to the local town. Rural cops are pretty chill as they are part of the community and get it. Also works because people are responsible. We had one family move in that was trouble, doing burnouts everywhere and taking bikes onto other people properties type behaviour. Cops went and had a chat with them, no idea what they said but I haven't seem them take a unregistered vehicle off the property in over 18 months. Everyone else, no problem.

MY parents forced me to get comfortable around them, never hang out in blind spots etc.  I would take the local lanes to avoid traffic and I felt comfortable because truckers were white males and predictable.   Fast forward 20 years I bought a car in kansas.  Almost had one run me off the road week one.  Saw multiple tractors on the left lane not passing, lots of ghetto and 3rd world drivers.  Trucks are cutting people off as if they are in an Altima.  Now I avoid trucks at all costs.  Inevitably I get stuck behind some jackass in the left lane just cruising along in the blind spot of a truck not even attempting to pass.  I back off, got to the right and pass them off.
