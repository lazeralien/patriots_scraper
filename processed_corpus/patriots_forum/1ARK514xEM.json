I didn\u2019t vote for a diplomat, I voted for a fighter and a winner permalink award report block reply Porkbut 6 points 6 days ago This is a bs post anyway, mickhigan was all for our intervention when he accused Israel of killing Christians. Now Christians are being killed in sudan and he reposts shit saying we should disengage entirely? He sounds like a propagandist who hates Christians and wants to use them for his political ambitions, which are currently undermining the Trump admin any chance he gets. permalink parent award report block reply keeman 4 points 6 days ago A stopped clock is right twice a day.  This is one of those times. permalink parent award report block reply Porkbut 1 points 6 days ago No he isnt though. Hes saying nothing, like cold reading a room to tell people what their dead relatives think, its a grift of manipulation. You say it yourself, hes telling you what you want to hear. permalink parent award report block reply spinometer2 1 points 6 days ago his peace deals also bring foreign investment which is what we need to keep the dollar on top and add jobs permalink parent award report block reply MoldyLocksNesMonste 21 points 6 days ago Definitely too much time being spent globetrotting when the house is on fire and the arsons are being left to keep starting more fires. permalink award report block reply billhound 11 points 6 days ago I think this misses the point that a lot of what he is doing is detangling the US from a global system. The peace deals in Asia and the one last attempted in Ukraine were about shoring up American supply chains. I think, just like renovations to the white house, there is more than meets the eye. Does it change the fact that eating out fornmy family of 3 is hard to spend less than 100 bucks? Not yet. But i think we are setting the US up for a boom. permalink award report block reply FromNC 4 points 6 days ago I don\u2019t doubt that he is doing positive in his overseas work that will benefit us. BUT, he continues to gaslight us about how well the country is doing and how much better the average person is doing today. That doesn\u2019t resonate with the average middle class individual  that sees the average car price now over $50k, see ground beef at $7/lb, see the average home price in the US nearly $500k yet have an average salary of $66k. The average couple, both making the average salary, cannot afford the average house. permalink parent award report block reply keeman 6 points 6 days ago You have only so much energy and political capital.  Spending it on ending wars in outer bumfuckistan necessitates not spending it here.  And the swamp continues to grow.  He needs to come home and fire nearly everyone in the federal government and replace them with nothing, get all the illegals out, and push id requirements for federal elections. permalink parent award report block reply vongregormench 5 points 6 days ago Trump\u2019s early actions involved reducing the government footprint. This will have a temporary negative effect on the economy. Some of what he has done will take time. Also mass deportations and the slowing of H1 b again momentary negative effects that in the long run help the economy. permalink parent award report block reply Spiritof2015 3 points 6 days ago Eggs are $2, they were $10 under Biden. permalink parent award report block reply FromNC 7 points 6 days ago What\u2019s your point, milk is also $0.99/gallon here where it was $3. I buy eggs once every other month and milk twice a month - those expenses make such a tiny difference in the grand scheme of things. I don\u2019t think the average guy in his 20s that can\u2019t afford a house or a new vehicle is going to resonate with the messaging \u201cYea eggs cost what they historically have always cost\u201d Cool story, you lost his vote. permalink parent award report block reply billhound 2 points 6 days ago Those items take a long time to fix...but trust me, when landlords have to compete because there arent enough renters, prices drop. When your house sits on the market because of surplus housing, you lower your asking price. When you negotiate trade deals that have foreign governments buying our products,  all that changes Those things. Im not saying it doesnt suck, but what are you actually asking for? A fix or an executive order? permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Spiritof2015 0 points 6 days ago My point is some food prices have fallen a lot. I'll let you get back to your dooming and pointless stories. permalink parent award report block reply view 5 more comments... Appeal2Heaven98 1 points 6 days ago Where are they $2 for you now when they were $10 under Biden? Where I live, they were $4 a dozen under Biden and have maybe dipped to $3.50 depending on the brand. You're either buying cheaper brands now, which refutes your point, have moved to another state, or are being straight-up dishonest. permalink parent award report block reply Spiritof2015 1 points 6 days ago At the grocery store next door to my house.  Same eggs, different prices. permalink parent award report block reply RuleoVicus 1 points 6 days ago So? And a 5lb box of nails is still $10 (was $4), and every tool is still 50-70% than it was before 2021. A roll of 14/2 wire is $150, used to be $45l Nothing involving the trades, materials or tools, have dropped in prices. permalink parent award report block reply Spiritof2015 2 points 6 days ago So? 5lb box of nails was $4 when? Was $1 once upon a time. So the price of eggs is down. Literally all I said, apparently enough to trigger bitches like they were libtards. permalink parent award report block reply booga 2 points 6 days ago Yeah, it reminds me of Biden's administration constantly saying the economy was good, when the average person experiences differently. I hope Trump starts focusing more on our people in America and stops trying to play world peace maker. permalink parent award report block reply FromNC 5 points 6 days ago I don\u2019t know why kind of anti-Trump people are downvoting you or I, but the most dangerous thing our movement can do is deny reality. What young person that can\u2019t afford a living cares if the stock market hit all time highs. Here\u2019s a simple fact, as a millennial, making 2-3x the national average pay, who bought his first house at 29, that does have a good start on his 401k. I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend that I\u2019m the average person my age. I am above average, I worked hard for the opportunities I have but my father, my grandfather had it significantly better than I. permalink parent award report block reply Maganifice7 10 points 6 days ago Trump has wasted most of his first year. Then he argues with people who tell him food us still unaffordable. permalink award report block reply I_Am_John_Galt 14 points 6 days ago Wasted?   He has set in motion more systemic changes in 9 months than any president in my lifetime.  It's congress not codifying his EOs into law and judicial warfare that have held back the pace he's moving at. permalink parent award report block reply Magma_Biscuit 9 points 6 days ago This is true permalink parent award report block reply Neonentity 5 points 6 days ago Not just congress.  The entire stinking derpstate is working to subvert MAGA. permalink parent award report block reply Rakkasan91b 3 points 6 days ago I hate to say it, but until Congress actual does something and codify any of those changes into law he has been wasting his time.  I'm also good with presidents brokering peace deals and all, but he really does need to stop focusing so much on external issues and focus on internal issues. permalink parent award report block reply RuleoVicus 0 points 6 days ago I think Trump checked out domestically about 6 months ago. permalink parent award report block reply parttimefed 1 points 6 days ago I think he was chasing that Nobel peace prize permalink parent award report block reply Maganifice7 2 points 6 days ago So you are saying he hasn't accomplished anything. He should be calling out congress nonstop, not endorsing the worst members. permalink parent award report block reply I_Am_John_Galt 1 points 6 days ago I'm not saying that at all.  USAID has been decimated, the border is militarized, deportations are working and ramping up, inflation and unemployment are down, etc permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 2 points 6 days ago True, but how much of that \"systemic change\" will be reversed if a Democrat gets the presidency? How long did it take Biden to reverse nearly everything Trump did? A week? 24 hours? I sometimes think we weren't being realistic about what Trump could do at all. We'd like him to lowkey go full authoritarian, but he won't. And he can't do anything on his agenda with the system in place. permalink parent award report block reply load 1 more comments...

Both are important. permalink award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 3 points 6 days ago The best way Americans can protect Christians is to stop the spread of Islam on our home turf. permalink parent award report block reply Pede 6 points 6 days ago His term started out stellar. 26 executive orders on day 1 on all kinds of things to take back our country. Then he slowly transitioned to nonstop bullshit about the Israel and Ukraine wars and little else. If he did this shit during his campaign I wouldn't have voted at all. permalink award report block reply Magma_Biscuit 4 points 6 days ago Put yourself in Trumps shoes and think about the absolute brick wall the judicial branch is throwing up at everything he is trying to do domestically. That and the worthless Congress we have had for 30 years or better. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 2 points 6 days ago I get it. But if anything, that makes it even more demoralizing. permalink parent award report block reply keeptherepublic1776 1 points 6 days ago Not saying not voting is the answer but that's what will happen at we the mod terms because Republican voters are retarded permalink parent award report block reply Mobmando 0 points 6 days ago He could have ended the Ukraine war very quickly. He might not be giving arms directly but the war continues because of his support, especially satellite and other surveillance. At this point, it's mostly Trump's fault the war continues as it would not continue without him. Juice, Epstein and Kirk are also destroying everything that was prayed for. permalink parent award report block reply JoeMcCarthyWasRight 5 points 6 days ago The fact that we need to even say this just goes to show how fucking far Trump has moved from America First. Come on, man. We fucking need you, DJT! permalink award report block reply weltallic 5 points 6 days ago Obama got a Nobel peace prize. Trump wants one, too.  It's his final victory over Obama. No matter the cost. permalink award report block reply ParadigmShift2070 2 points 6 days ago And watch them still deny him one regardless of how peace deals he made permalink parent award report block reply becomelions 4 points 6 days ago this is a really short sighted, ignorant view of things. choosing between foreign and domestic action is a false dichotomy. we can have both. besides, the peace deals lead to trade deals which lead to massive domestic benefits. not to mention securing rare earth minerals, which removed a huge threat by china - something most experts thought was impossible. seems someone is mad trump has been amazingly effective and wants him to back-off. permalink award report block reply Dev404 4 points 6 days ago That's what MAGA was supposed to be, but he seems to be focused on foreign diplomacy and economic issues. That might be his strength, and not so much the law enforcement and justice issues. I think he's relying on Kash and Bondi for that, and they're failing spectacularly with goose egg after goose egg on high profile criminals while arresting a few henchmen here and there as evidence of progress. permalink award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 6 days ago I'm of two minds about that.  In all sincerity and honesty, Presidents are almost monarchs when it comes to foreign policy which is why most presidents almost exclusively act on Foreign policy and rarely do anything for their domestic base aside from the first six months in office. Congress, the House and Senate, should be focusing on domestic laws and policies , regulations and programs but they are often just running around pretending they are the drivers of foreign policy.    The difficulty is Congress is so deeply divided on the issues, so hopeless partisan which is mostly the fault of Democrats (no, it's not a both sides issue.  It is a 90% Democrats don't work with the other side issue) and rarely do congressional  representatives and Senators bother to educate themselves on the issues and make a solution.  Instead they leave statecraft up to lobbyists and then try to put a whole bunch of pork into every bill. I've heard it said and I agree, Congress is a glorified High School with two rival teams.  One team mostly plays by the rules and tries for agreement and the other team will stop at nothing to demonize, undermine, hurt and scuttle the other team.  The problem is neither team really has American citizens interests at heart. permalink award report block reply yummy_yumm_yumms 3 points 6 days ago Hopefully someone in his admin see this shit, this is the most important thing out of ANYTHING. permalink award report block reply vongregormench 3 points 6 days ago Why can\u2019t he do both?

In all sincerity and honesty, Presidents are almost monarchs when it comes to foreign policy which is why most presidents almost exclusively act on Foreign policy and rarely do anything for their domestic base aside from the first six months in office. Congress, the House and Senate, should be focusing on domestic laws and policies , regulations and programs but they are often just running around pretending they are the drivers of foreign policy.    The difficulty is Congress is so deeply divided on the issues, so hopeless partisan which is mostly the fault of Democrats (no, it's not a both sides issue.  It is a 90% Democrats don't work with the other side issue) and rarely do congressional  representatives and Senators bother to educate themselves on the issues and make a solution.  Instead they leave statecraft up to lobbyists and then try to put a whole bunch of pork into every bill. I've heard it said and I agree, Congress is a glorified High School with two rival teams.  One team mostly plays by the rules and tries for agreement and the other team will stop at nothing to demonize, undermine, hurt and scuttle the other team.  The problem is neither team really has American citizens interests at heart. permalink award report block reply\nyummy_yumm_yumms 3 points 6 days ago Hopefully someone in his admin see this shit, this is the most important thing out of ANYTHING. permalink award report block reply\nvongregormench 3 points 6 days ago Why can\u2019t he do both?
