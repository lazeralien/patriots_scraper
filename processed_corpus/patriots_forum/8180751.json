Lets go the full way.  Ashley Babbit was killed because Nancy wanted to blame Trump for the murder as part of trying to stick him with the insurrection charge.  The \"riot\" happened because capitol police fired into the crowd and the non-violent protesters panicked.  The doors were opened from the inside to invite the protesters into the capitol building and support the insurrection narrative.  There were no weapons in the protesters; zero; zilch.  There was no organized group but they arrested the proud boys and tried to prove they were running an organized insurrection but that case fell apart quickly.

Herpawinski 23 points 2 days ago Jesus fucking christ this is like running in a dream and not getting any closer to something. This was one of the worst crimes in American political history. They set people up then persecuted them for doing what they'd tricked them into doing. This is not a crime you can have pardon from. We are not whole until it is rectified. NAIL. SOME. FUCKING. HEADS. TO. THE. WALL. ALREADY!!! permalink award report block reply barefootozark 8 points 2 days ago It is.  Their charade resulted in shooting and killing people. OOPS!! The likely bomber shot J6'ers with rubber bullets the day after planting fake bombs. The fake bomber testified against J6'ers to help imprison them. The FBI stopped investigating the fake bomber, but they had the resources to impeach Trump!! There should be daily public hangings. permalink parent award report block reply dude_bro 3 points 2 days ago Still wonder what Trump meant to show up on J6 and it\u2019ll be \u201cwild.\u201d  Thank God I had some family members tell me it was a bad idea, I was intent to go. permalink parent award report block reply ZacPetkanas 2 points 2 days ago Yeah, me and a coworker were discussing maybe going but we both realized it would probably be a disaster. permalink parent award report block reply Herpawinski 2 points 1 day ago He meant show the legislators inside that the public supported the ones who called for re examining the election before certifying. It was to help give the naysayers inside some fortitude. That's it. Just a regular demonstration. If it worked just to affect the process, yet not even change the  legitimate result, even that would have been \"wild\" in historical terms, however the vote went after reexamining things. permalink parent award report block reply clownworld30330 1 points 2 days ago Well, it was wild. It was exactly what the derp state needed - what they made it be. permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 17 points 2 days ago The evidence isn't really new.

I knew from day one J6 was a Nanzi propaganda production. That has been her Motis Operandi for years. permalink award report block reply Briben 2 points 2 days ago It would be crazy if Capitol P.O. Of Ukrainian decent poses as bmber by night and the next day shoots pepper balls into a crowd to incite a riot, then is a lead court witness against the rioters and then moves on to CIA for her reward.  Has Maidan Coup vibes. permalink award report block reply BecauseYoudBeInJail 2 points 2 days ago Oh darn, that sucks when the suspect shoots herself twice in the back of the head later this week and one of the bullets goes through both her phone and laptop drives. permalink award report block reply ACActual 2 points 2 days ago J6 was planned to be a bloody Insurrection.   Zip Ties left out.  We were funneled into the West Terrace were Cops and as i to Saturday, the J6 Bomber who i also thought was a man.  They tried provoking us to bring guns so they would have an excuse to kill more than 4 of us but also Congressmen and or Senators.  This was the Deep States Operation Valkyrie.  We need Executions and whole lot of Prosecutions permalink award report block reply Spellmonger 1 points 2 days ago Call both Senators and the Representative who are supposed to be reporting to you, and tell them that you know and demand they come home and offer a public apology along with an explanation of why they went along with it. They don't get to second-guess us, no matter who we voted for, if the election was honestly conducted. permalink award report block reply MajorClark 1 points 2 days ago Obama, Biden, Pelosi, Pence and other seditionist/treasonous traitors deserve to be in prison Alligator Alcatraz style. permalink award report block reply ckover9000 1 points 2 days ago \"Can't be ignored\" LOL this is what Ka$h does best! permalink award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 2 days ago Just because some 4chan autist claims to have matched the bomber's gait to some capital cop, is absolutely not \"evidence\". This is a huge problem here. People are presented with some clickfluencer theory which may have some grain of truth to it, but they filter it as absolute truth and then get angry when nobody's doing anything about it. permalink award report block reply Fuck_reddit34 1 points 2 days ago Attack attack attack!!!! permalink award report block reply Goatboy66 1 points 2 days ago Find and watch the Video \" Everything wrong with the Capital Shooting in twenty one minutes or less\".....It was all Staged. permalink award report block reply Returningtogod 1 points 2 days ago Oh - it CAN and it WILL be ignored. permalink award report block reply clownworld30330 1 points 2 days ago One news item does not a flood make. permalink award report block reply SubmarineGuy 1 points 2 days ago I'm happy that Trump pardoned the J6 patriots, but what about the 4 people who committed suicide because of the crashing burden of this horrific procecution ? What is to be done about this shocking injustice? permalink award report block reply KneadThePeople 1 points 2 days ago 13 have yet to be pardoned. Fuck the cops who were \u201csuicided\u201d I care about my J6 Brothers and Sisters who have committed suicide waiting on justice. permalink parent award report block reply friedchicken 1 points 2 days ago What freaks me out is how readily the media towed the line \"insurrection insurrection insurrection\"; an attempt to sway a jury to finding trump guilty of an insurrection and bar him from becoming president again. Unreal; and people pretend like this never happened permalink award report block reply Choppermagic 1 points 2 days ago It was already obvious.  Unless people are actually arrested, nothing will happen and it will continue permalink award report block reply barefootozark 1 points 2 days ago New info on the faux bomber: Kerkhoff served as a training officer in less lethal weapons and had access to training objects, which included dummy pipe bombs. On January 6, Kerkhoff is seen at the Capitol Building firing volleys of less-than-lethal ordnance at protesters. She testified in federal court against people at the Capitol on January 6. The former Capitol Police officer is also a former professional soccer player who suffered a career-ending injury and had surgery that left her with a permanent, mild limp, which shows up in the J6 bomber video released by the FBI. The publication said that Kerkhoff's gait matches the video obtained of her at work at the Capitol. We should be hearing from John Ratcliffe, Director of the CIA, if the bomber will be made available for comment. We should be hearing from Patel and Bongino if they are investigating Kerkhoff in light of this new information. permalink award report block reply Female 1 points 2 days ago Corrupt dishonest News media: challenge accepted permalink award report block reply yepyep 1 points 1 day ago The media will kinda mention of it\u2019s existence but won\u2019t really look at it so they can say they haven\u2019t seen any evidence of it. permalink award report block reply Judiwont 1 points 2 days ago Those people climbing the wall were for a photo op.

Or is it only an \"insilurrection\" now that evidence is coming out it was an inside job? But before that evidence, the right was saying it was a big nothing burger. How can both be true?

Unless people are actually arrested, nothing will happen and it will continue permalink award report block reply\nbarefootozark 1 points 2 days ago New info on the faux bomber: Kerkhoff served as a training officer in less lethal weapons and had access to training objects, which included dummy pipe bombs. On January 6, Kerkhoff is seen at the Capitol Building firing volleys of less-than-lethal ordnance at protesters. She testified in federal court against people at the Capitol on January 6. The former Capitol Police officer is also a former professional soccer player who suffered a career-ending injury and had surgery that left her with a permanent, mild limp, which shows up in the J6 bomber video released by the FBI. The publication said that Kerkhoff's gait matches the video obtained of her at work at the Capitol. We should be hearing from John Ratcliffe, Director of the CIA, if the bomber will be made available for comment. We should be hearing from Patel and Bongino if they are investigating Kerkhoff in light of this new information. permalink award report block reply\nFemale 1 points 2 days ago Corrupt dishonest News media: challenge accepted permalink award report block reply\nyepyep 1 points 1 day ago The media will kinda mention of it\u2019s existence but won\u2019t really look at it so they can say they haven\u2019t seen any evidence of it. permalink award report block reply\nJudiwont 1 points 2 days ago Those people climbing the wall were for a photo op.
