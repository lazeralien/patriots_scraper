Trying to blame food stamps for the insane increase of prices since the lockdowns is retarded. How many meat processing plants have been relatively recently burned to the ground? How many farmers have been bankrupted and bought up by massive corporations? How much farmland has been paved over and filled with overpriced and shoddily built McMansions? There are plenty of other factors that can be attributed to just plain greed that is allowed to run rampant in our country that is hiking the prices on everything , not just food. permalink award report block reply Keep_on_winning_kag 2 points 6 days ago Three or four meat plants out of hundreds. It's 40 million welfare people and illegals buying whatever they want at the store that jacks up the prices.

Wayne Knight is a TDS libtard and people post the \" See Nobody Cares \" meme here constantly. Also of course you're a commie faggot from Portland, Beau Hamilton. You: Clinton wiped the floor with Trump tonight. Say hello to your next president, America! #debatenight Steve Bannon, President Trump's chief strategist, has been removed from the National Security Council, official says.\nYou: Better late than never, but to think that Trump thought he was a good fit to begin with encapsulates the ignorance of this administration. President Trump: James Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! You: Ooh, the President of the \"free world\" is making threats now against a former FBI director in the middle of an investigation. IDIOT! You: The stock market is plunging, government is shut down, and Trump keeps tweeting gibberish... Merry Christmas everyone! \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udf84 You: This is a disgrace. I hope when shit hits the fan all of Trump's supporters get hosed first. You: Trump citing a couple murders/rapes committed by illegal immigrants is truly disgusting. The vast majority of crimes are committed by American citizens. Plain & simple. The vast majority of illegal immigrants simply want a better life for themselves & there family. You: What. A. Speech. I'm SO thankful to have a president that embodies hope and decency. We're rooting for you @JoeBiden!! permalink parent award report block reply LLP2 2 points 6 days ago Wow!

The \u201chandout tax\u201d and \u201cmulticulturalism tax\u201d makes everything else across the board FAR more expensive. permalink award report block reply carpetxparmesan 1 points 6 days ago That's part of it. But it's mostly because 90% of you EAT OUT. Read that again. 9 in 10 people don't cook at home. They mostly eat out. Makes sense. Why put in a 40k kitchen when you can just eat 40k of food for 6-7 years? Of course there are other factors. Like the 40 million (or more). But keep in mind there are other factors like... some foods are \"below price\" because of food being part of the US defense program and whether you like them or not (some are good, some are bad, the consequences are a mixed bag and often unintended) tariffs and subsidies are a thing. If I had to put my finger on both food and the housing market, other factors like government regulation and cartel-like behavior at high levels would rank #1 for me. But I'll admit I underestimated the effects of illegals a little bit. Still, they're not THE factor. They're a contributing factor. Don't take this as some kind of doompilling or argumentative shitposting. I just want to open your mind to certain realities: defense doctrine/policy, subsidies and tariffs, mostly-globohomo-us-backstabbing corpos. Just like with covid, don't let these people skate by saying oh it's not a real virus. Of course illegals and fraud IS A THING, unlike what democrats claim. Just don't go full retard in the excitement. permalink award report block reply Electrocutioner 2 points 6 days ago I can believe that 9 out of 10 order out each night or everyday. If you take into to account atleast 1 meal isn't home cooked it becomes really easy to reach that number. Like stopping to get a breakfast sandwich and coffee or something for lunch. permalink parent award report block reply Keep_on_winning_kag 2 points 6 days ago My neighbor across the hall leaves every day like clock work when he goes out to eat. permalink parent award report block reply projectarcturus1 1 points 6 days ago That is a really big part of it. permalink award report block reply MisterMAGA 1 points 6 days ago That\u2019s a reason, one of many. permalink award report block reply pedespeed 1 points 6 days ago Is it possible Ted is wrong? Are people really getting it for free or are tax payers competing for food against their own government? permalink award report block reply carpetxparmesan 5 points 6 days ago He's not wrong. They are ADVERTISING to EBT. Companies don't advertise to people that don't make them money... at all. I don't know if you noticed, but whenever something good comes for free, at low cost, or is mostly for people who wouldn't otherwise afford it, it's either a government program behind the scenes (usually) or more rarely, people are bundling money to get it done. Things very rarely happen out of grassroots money pooling, to the point that it's almost not a thing that happens. He might be wrong about the degree to which it impacts. But, I would also guess, an area in which this might have a lot of impact is breakfast cereals for kids. Breakfast cereals are bad for kids. They're pretty much breakfast crack, legal, for kids. Legal to advertise, legal to hook them on it, it's pretty much both a physical sugar ADDICTION, yeah they go into withdrawal without it, try it sometime, and a psychological addiction. I would guess a lot of EBT kids eat a lot of expensive breakfast cereal. And parents who actually pay for those cereals are forced to buy them at the inflated, often 100-150% inflated prices. Neither the raw ingredients WHICH ARE SUBSIDIZED, btw, creating a whole other problem/dimension, nor the manufacturing techniques and cost of those cereals are as expensive as the supermarket price of \"cereals\" would suggest. They're not even cheap, like they used to be a long time ago, in BULK... which tells you a lot about pricing strategy. Also, comparing it to animal feed is another interesting approach to it. Yeah, your kid insn't a miniature pony, but.... as you learned in with the chink flu... There are some \"cheap\" alternatives now, 90% of the flavor and \"quality\" for 50% (or less) of the price from the likes of Aldis. Which tells you even more. There are also the profits. If you look at their profits and losses, you'll see the cereal companies pull a verizon/telecom on the government and the public. What do I mean by that? Money going to last line that never gets there (ebt-like). Complaining for 10 years they're losing money and then getting bailed out by the government for 2-3x their \"losses\" with the end result being every 20-30 years, MASSIVE profits off the back of these scams (both on consumers and on government). Hur dur losing money. But you're getting record profits? Oh ... oh... you just got bailed out! Maybe I'm not explaining this properly, but those who follow telecoms, you'll know what I'm talking about. You know where there's \"reality\"? Buckweat. Rice. Cornmeal. Shit people don't want to cook with because cooking from scratch doesnt taste as good, if we're being honest (don't @ me, I know how to make it taste better than store-bought or restaurant), and it takes way more work and planning. So the prices there reflect that reality. Which gives you an idea where these companies are screwing you or lying or getting some government money laundering or kickbacks or whatever the fuck. Beans, however, are not a great indicator, I think there's something else going on with beans. They're a little more expensive than they should be but whatever, not a big deal. Some people think beef really should be 20-30$/lb for the good stuff. I haven't made up my mind about that. I think there are places where he's 100% right (and you are too) and places where it's less accurate or predictive of the cost. Just thoughts, no anger. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc51\ud83e\ude87 permalink parent award report block reply Citizen_Bob -1 points 6 days ago iirc 20m of them can be deported. permalink award report block reply RedStoneDeepState -4 points 6 days ago Food isnt expensive.

Few people will admit it, but it's what actually happens when you walk the walk and you don't just bloviate platitudes. Anyway, not arguing with you, just thought I'd lay it out there. Yeah, I agree with you, just saying that post-walk, things might actually get more expensive. Which would also be fine, I guess. It might actually motivate people to OWN farmland or have big stakes in megacorpos that own the farmland. For the future, as a kind of 40,000ft overview of the future, we shouldn't rely on \"cheap food\". We should actually bite the bullet and eat the expense of OWNING all the farmland in the US. There's not that much of it. If each of us puts 30,000$ and owns ONE acre, we'd be okay. Of course, that's a \"wasted\" 30k to just... hoard stonks, as it were. Anyway, I won't confuse you any further. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 2 points 6 days ago Idk, man, I've been \"putting my money where my mouth is\" with farm-to-table, made-in-america, local food, things like that Dude, you are paying hippies. Virtually all grain, beans, chicken and pork in a supermarket is made in America. Once you go to the farmer and start paying for grain wholesale, you are paying a tiny fraction of retail prices. I personally boycott most imported/Californian food. About the only thing I buy that may be imported is Japanese beef or Argentine/Brazilian beef. But that is a minority of my food budget.  And imported rice, because my boycott on California is more important than boycotting foreign countries. Otherwise pretty much everything I eat is American. ...my food costs are lower than the average American because it means I have low effort vegetable gardens and I dont eat imported exotic shit. permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 1 points 5 days ago You have a valid perspective.

But it's mostly because 90% of you EAT OUT. Read that again. 9 in 10 people don't cook at home. They mostly eat out. Makes sense. Why put in a 40k kitchen when you can just eat 40k of food for 6-7 years? Of course there are other factors. Like the 40 million (or more). But keep in mind there are other factors like... some foods are \"below price\" because of food being part of the US defense program and whether you like them or not (some are good, some are bad, the consequences are a mixed bag and often unintended) tariffs and subsidies are a thing. If I had to put my finger on both food and the housing market, other factors like government regulation and cartel-like behavior at high levels would rank #1 for me. But I'll admit I underestimated the effects of illegals a little bit. Still, they're not THE factor. They're a contributing factor. Don't take this as some kind of doompilling or argumentative shitposting. I just want to open your mind to certain realities: defense doctrine/policy, subsidies and tariffs, mostly-globohomo-us-backstabbing corpos. Just like with covid, don't let these people skate by saying oh it's not a real virus. Of course illegals and fraud IS A THING, unlike what democrats claim.

They are ADVERTISING to EBT. Companies don't advertise to people that don't make them money... at all. I don't know if you noticed, but whenever something good comes for free, at low cost, or is mostly for people who wouldn't otherwise afford it, it's either a government program behind the scenes (usually) or more rarely, people are bundling money to get it done. Things very rarely happen out of grassroots money pooling, to the point that it's almost not a thing that happens. He might be wrong about the degree to which it impacts. But, I would also guess, an area in which this might have a lot of impact is breakfast cereals for kids. Breakfast cereals are bad for kids. They're pretty much breakfast crack, legal, for kids. Legal to advertise, legal to hook them on it, it's pretty much both a physical sugar ADDICTION, yeah they go into withdrawal without it, try it sometime, and a psychological addiction. I would guess a lot of EBT kids eat a lot of expensive breakfast cereal. And parents who actually pay for those cereals are forced to buy them at the inflated, often 100-150% inflated prices. Neither the raw ingredients WHICH ARE SUBSIDIZED, btw, creating a whole other problem/dimension, nor the manufacturing techniques and cost of those cereals are as expensive as the supermarket price of \"cereals\" would suggest. They're not even cheap, like they used to be a long time ago, in BULK... which tells you a lot about pricing strategy. Also, comparing it to animal feed is another interesting approach to it. Yeah, your kid insn't a miniature pony, but.... as you learned in with the chink flu... There are some \"cheap\" alternatives now, 90% of the flavor and \"quality\" for 50% (or less) of the price from the likes of Aldis. Which tells you even more. There are also the profits. If you look at their profits and losses, you'll see the cereal companies pull a verizon/telecom on the government and the public. What do I mean by that? Money going to last line that never gets there (ebt-like). Complaining for 10 years they're losing money and then getting bailed out by the government for 2-3x their \"losses\" with the end result being every 20-30 years, MASSIVE profits off the back of these scams (both on consumers and on government). Hur dur losing money. But you're getting record profits? Oh ... oh... you just got bailed out! Maybe I'm not explaining this properly, but those who follow telecoms, you'll know what I'm talking about. You know where there's \"reality\"? Buckweat. Rice. Cornmeal. Shit people don't want to cook with because cooking from scratch doesnt taste as good, if we're being honest (don't @ me, I know how to make it taste better than store-bought or restaurant), and it takes way more work and planning. So the prices there reflect that reality. Which gives you an idea where these companies are screwing you or lying or getting some government money laundering or kickbacks or whatever the fuck. Beans, however, are not a great indicator, I think there's something else going on with beans. They're a little more expensive than they should be but whatever, not a big deal. Some people think beef really should be 20-30$/lb for the good stuff. I haven't made up my mind about that. I think there are places where he's 100% right (and you are too) and places where it's less accurate or predictive of the cost. Just thoughts, no anger. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc51\ud83e\ude87 permalink parent award report block reply\ncarpetxparmesan 5 points 6 days ago He's not wrong. They are ADVERTISING to EBT.

Yeah, your kid insn't a miniature pony, but.... as you learned in with the chink flu... There are some \"cheap\" alternatives now, 90% of the flavor and \"quality\" for 50% (or less) of the price from the likes of Aldis. Which tells you even more. There are also the profits. If you look at their profits and losses, you'll see the cereal companies pull a verizon/telecom on the government and the public. What do I mean by that? Money going to last line that never gets there (ebt-like). Complaining for 10 years they're losing money and then getting bailed out by the government for 2-3x their \"losses\" with the end result being every 20-30 years, MASSIVE profits off the back of these scams (both on consumers and on government). Hur dur losing money. But you're getting record profits? Oh ... oh... you just got bailed out! Maybe I'm not explaining this properly, but those who follow telecoms, you'll know what I'm talking about. You know where there's \"reality\"? Buckweat. Rice. Cornmeal. Shit people don't want to cook with because cooking from scratch doesnt taste as good, if we're being honest (don't @ me, I know how to make it taste better than store-bought or restaurant), and it takes way more work and planning. So the prices there reflect that reality. Which gives you an idea where these companies are screwing you or lying or getting some government money laundering or kickbacks or whatever the fuck. Beans, however, are not a great indicator, I think there's something else going on with beans. They're a little more expensive than they should be but whatever, not a big deal. Some people think beef really should be 20-30$/lb for the good stuff. I haven't made up my mind about that. I think there are places where he's 100% right (and you are too) and places where it's less accurate or predictive of the cost. Just thoughts, no anger. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc51\ud83e\ude87 permalink parent award report block reply\nCitizen_Bob -1 points 6 days ago iirc 20m of them can be deported. permalink award report block reply\nRedStoneDeepState -4 points 6 days ago Food isnt expensive.

Few people will admit it, but it's what actually happens when you walk the walk and you don't just bloviate platitudes. Anyway, not arguing with you, just thought I'd lay it out there. Yeah, I agree with you, just saying that post-walk, things might actually get more expensive. Which would also be fine, I guess. It might actually motivate people to OWN farmland or have big stakes in megacorpos that own the farmland. For the future, as a kind of 40,000ft overview of the future, we shouldn't rely on \"cheap food\". We should actually bite the bullet and eat the expense of OWNING all the farmland in the US. There's not that much of it. If each of us puts 30,000$ and owns ONE acre, we'd be okay. Of course, that's a \"wasted\" 30k to just... hoard stonks, as it were. Anyway, I won't confuse you any further. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 2 points 6 days ago Idk, man, I've been \"putting my money where my mouth is\" with farm-to-table, made-in-america, local food, things like that Dude, you are paying hippies. Virtually all grain, beans, chicken and pork in a supermarket is made in America. Once you go to the farmer and start paying for grain wholesale, you are paying a tiny fraction of retail prices. I personally boycott most imported/Californian food. About the only thing I buy that may be imported is Japanese beef or Argentine/Brazilian beef. But that is a minority of my food budget.  And imported rice, because my boycott on California is more important than boycotting foreign countries. Otherwise pretty much everything I eat is American. ...my food costs are lower than the average American because it means I have low effort vegetable gardens and I dont eat imported exotic shit. permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 1 points 5 days ago You have a valid perspective.
