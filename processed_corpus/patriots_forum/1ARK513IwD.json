IvotedforTrumptwice 7 points 6 days ago A rule of thumb I\u2019ve learned in life is that the person attacking someone\u2019s character or identity like name calling, is usually speaking from an emotional state and not a logical one which makes their argument unreliable. The person isn\u2019t speaking through love which is the truth but through anger and contempt for another one of God\u2019s children and thy are inherently not speaking reasonably. Basically, if someone speaks like the devil, it\u2019s probably a lie, if they speak like Jesus, it\u2019s probably the truth. It\u2019s not always the case but we live in a world where truth is hard to find so that\u2019s the best way to find it. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

Trying to say some 23 year old whignat dude in his basement is not a friend to America but Israel is after all the proven betrayals by them is retarded.

He isn't driving anyone away from israel.  In fact, he is entrenching them.  Instead of dealing with the israel problem rationally and deliberately by moving the overton window, he's sperging out thousands of retards to be an observable problem.  A problem to israel, sure, but also a problem to everyone else. You are not helping. permalink parent award report block reply how_could 6 points 6 days ago Islam is a ridiculous political ideology and cultural plague but have you not figured out where the conflicts and organizations that displace the \"muslim refugees\" originate?  Do you not know that Israel helped create and currently funds Hamas and every manner of cultural marxism in our country that the muslims then used to grow their presence?

The young voter base already feel betrayed and they aren't using Twitter at all. Most of the younger folks are on Instagram surprisingly and Tiktok still. That is where they were able to make all of their jokes without getting banned so naturally that is where they ended up the last 2 years. Twitter is full of government, shills and boomers currently. It's a message board with the ability to embed video. A dinosaur for content and getting messages across. On top of that, Elon has the paywall for getting noticed which is incredibly stupid given his alleged \"$40bil+ buyout\" of the company. It makes no sense.

I mean Trump 2015 ripping them to shreds, and slapping our base awake. We need to go hard against them.

Among the top posts, someone said that \"suddenly he's a psyop?\" No. There is something intrinsically wrong with the fact that more leftists knew who Nick Fuentes was than conservatives.

Nick's own actions have proved him an undercover democrat. Nick and his goypters are glowfags that spent years leading up to 2020 attacking Charlie Kirk, TPUSA, and Trump. Then Nick showed his true colors again leading up to 2024. Everything they do is in support of democrats. Fuentes admits he and groypers celebrate the defeat of MAGA amidst Mamdani's victory and \"blue wave\". Proof of his duplicity. Nick tweeting in 2024: \"Save Trump Save the Campaign\" While also campaigning against Trump in 2024: \"I will not vote for Trump.\" Nick's 2019 speech at his \"groyper leadership summit\" One of those pictured above tweeted: \"Big thanks to the groyper that superchatted this \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f and much love to the GOAT\n@NickJFuentes\n07\" permalink parent award report block reply IForgotToAddAnEmail 13 points 6 days ago It does matter.

Do you not understand the entire true MAGA base, the real MAGA base, feels Israel has completely taken over Trump's second term already? Anyone who spends 5 minutes outside of the Twitter echo chamber will see this. There is an avalanche of pissed off people currently. Many of them the young voter base. On top of that, Bibi has been stupidly openly bragging about it on camera! LOL da fuq Then Trump admitted he does whatever his largest donor Miriam Adelson wants during his last Israel visit... ON CAMERA! da fuq Between the Israel takeover of our government, the endless funding to Ukraine still, and the Argentina bailout bullshit, people don't feel they have another 4 years to waste. And the EBT boogeyman situation was the perfect cherry on top in the minds of NYC voters and in other blue/purple areas. They voted for what was promised, \"a Golden Age of America\" and they don't see it at all. There isn't a hint of it on the radar in their minds. NYC didn't really have any viable candidates, it was like choosing which end of a shit stick to lick. It's been declining since 9/11. Another problem is Democrats pay their shills and protesters, MAGA goes to jobs and works. There's a problem right there. The dems have infinite resources to waste while MAGA is busy paying bills and keeping rules. MAGA think only voting day matters.\nDems see everyday as an activists' wet dream. permalink award report block reply IForgotToAddAnEmail 24 points 6 days ago So far, boomers have done nothing but promise the Young Generation a lot.

College degrees were paths to success and decent salary, job security, etc. I think life was so good we didn't need to question much...then 9/11 happened, then 2008 happened and everything else and here we are struggling to piece it all together in a meaningful way but our generation and the ones before it lacked \"activism\" (I know it's a liberal term but I have no other way to describe it). It feels like we are an aging man struggling to put the boxing gloves on and we have never boxed before. Concerned with not getting caught by the next crisis that would put us in financial or physical ruin, we've been through so many at this point.

Why would this equal an existential crisis for the American patriotic right?  Answer: it wouldn't. Unless Israel actually does have the literal means to destroy us. Which would mean that Nick would actually be right. Which means that the psyop is actually coming from Israel. I've seen them absolutely flooding the zone with unending torrents of \"Christian Zionist\" posts on X to try to control, literally, the Christian religion.  And so now I have to look with jaundiced eye the source of these doctrines in the Christian church.  And so now I have to revisit the source and the foundation for my beliefs (the Bible) and am that much more convinced that this is an attempt by Zionists to hijack the Western church. So psyops?  I know where those are coming from.  I am not fooled for one second. And so I have a clearer view than ever of who the enemies of freedom really are.  And it's sad.  I did not want to become what is described in popular media as \"antisemitic\" or a \"conspiracy theorist.\"  It is really sad.  But the truth is that people who know and believe the truth are being pushed to the margins of society. This is not an accident. And it has become all the more vehement and manic since the execution of Charlie Kirk.

Well as you'd expect my comment got instantly downvoted. The second comment on the post was me saying \"really? downvoting me deus? You must love israeli pedos!\" And guess what happened next? Checkmate! The israeli team behind the deusvult1096 account realized its an uncontainable truth. Why isn't tom back in a nevada court? And because this Unit 8200 asshole could not defend this sicko jew, they deleted the friggin post! XD That tells you its all about publicity and narrative framing. Each post has to convey israels subtle messaging. Each one has to garner the type of responses they are after.

How do you lack the self awareness to see that you guys are treating Fuentes the same exact way the left treats Trump? I have listened to hours of his interviews and a couple of his shows. He doesn't seem to be pro-America to me I doubt this very much. His entire show is pro-America. His entire tucker interview was pro-America. His entire PBD interview was pro-America. I'm open to having my mind changed if I'm wrong Doubtful, I won't be able to penetrate your decades of brainwashing, this is something you need to learn for yourself.

Every single action, every word they say, is to divide conservatives and scapegoat entire races. They are lower humans and should be treated just like the Woke Left. They claim to be MAGA but do not share Western virtues, they do not share Trump's values, and most important, they do not share AMERICAN values positions on politics.  Instead they demand those values are what they want, and preach hatred. Most are White or Christian Nationalists making them genuinely immoral based on Bible and unamerican, based on 250 years of common history. They are fake patriots.\nThe fakest in fact!!! They are not MAGA, even if they argue otherwise. And that is why we have websites like this one. So people who use a movement like MAGA as a disguise have a place to jerk each other off. Keeps them away from the mainstream and in the fringes where they belong. Musk see's their comments. As do the rest of us. They are in fact the dangerous racist contingent that Democrats (and others) use to justify their campaign of hate and ostracization against all of the rest of us, and the Groypers/Woke Right play right into their hands. Its overdue that we made a clear separation between the WOKE RIGHT Jew Haters and mainstream MAGA. And we are going to, and in a big way.  We are going to make sure America see's you as separate from MAGA and Trump because you are. The rest of us are not going along with your Prison Cafeteria political system. And we will make sure your CIA handler Jesuit Scum get the fucking message. Many of us no longer care why you are this way, and do not share your views on society about race. We understand that open borders was weapoinized and is not the same as legitimate regular and sustainable immigration levels. (Which is what made America) The WOKE RIGHT view is effectively a prisoner/convict level functioning. We are better people then them. We do not run the country like a Prison Cafeteria. You want to sit at a table that is not your race, you have that right. The important thing is to quarantine radicals online, isolate them, and make sure Groypers and Far Right stand all alone in a echo chamber. And when young boys are misled and espouse these racial beliefs we must take them aside, and re-educate them on Western Culture starting with Ancient Greece and Individual Freedom. Their fathers were not good enough men to teach them that you judge individuals on merit, and that stereotypes are not the full picture. It sounds simple, but there is a % of hate filled lower class, lower intellects, lower spirits, whom genuinely need to hate. Usually unresolved mommy/daddy issues they come by honestly and do not know how to cope with. They need a simple outlet, a group of OTHERS they can point at and blame for everything. And that is natural, what is wrong is the way the radical WOKE RIGHT / Groypers take advantage of that need, and mislead them, contributing to the delinquency of minors and many others. Its the same as Woke Left. If the CIA wanted to divide Conservatives it would create exactly the kind of thing Carlson, Fuentes, and others are pushing. Elon is wise to put a stop to it, and its good that these scumbags are forced to fight it out on fringe websites like this one. The Woke Right is just as despicable and disgusting as the Woke Left. Very much so. The only difference is they are smaller and their hate is inverse. Beyond that its the same collectivism, and looks very much like another managed PsyOp like the Woke Left or Q were. All based on Jew Hate and harming Israel to make it yet more repulsive.. They cannot hide it, even when they talk about other stuff, their transparent, the people see through them and their CIA/NGO contrived hate. The world see's them, despite their games.

But why are we propping up an effeminate faggot? His politics suck, he says a couple based things about nogs and Jews but making him our spokesperson literally makes the right look like weak, frail, effeminate, whiny faggots. I\u2019m talking about the femininity and faggotry of Fuentes, why are you avoiding that conversation? Why do his followers not want to talk about the elephant in the room?? permalink parent award report block reply medicpatriot 0 points 6 days ago That take kind of reminds me of the \u201cyou talk like a fag\u201d idiots from the movie Idiocracy. permalink parent award report block reply DaBirdisDaWord 2 points 6 days ago He\u2019s literally an outed Faggot, we\u2019re not even talking solely about his overt femininity. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

I agree with Fuentes on a decent amount of stuff but I still think he\u2019s a faggot. He\u2019s a weird mix between autistic edge lord loser and used car salesman with turrets who spent too much time with his drunk uncle at family functions as a kid. Clandestine is a Q leftover who simps for Israel and typically appeals to midwit LARPERs who need to think they\u2019ve got the inside scoop on whatever\u2019s really going on at the moment. OP\u2019s post history speaks for itself. Most of his posts are either directly or indirectly connected to Israel in some way.

The young voter base already feel betrayed and they aren't using Twitter at all. Most of the younger folks are on Instagram surprisingly and Tiktok still. That is where they were able to make all of their jokes without getting banned so naturally that is where they ended up the last 2 years. Twitter is full of government, shills and boomers currently. It's a message board with the ability to embed video. A dinosaur for content and getting messages across. On top of that, Elon has the paywall for getting noticed which is incredibly stupid given his alleged \"$40bil+ buyout\" of the company. It makes no sense. LOL So when people on this site claim \"nah uhhhh shill\" it's because they aren't where the meaningful voter base is and they have no idea the topics they are debating etc. People still post Laura Loomer tweets on here ffs LOL permalink parent award report block reply Jaqen 11 points 6 days ago On top of that, Elon has the paywall for getting noticed which is incredibly stupid given his alleged \"$40bil+ buyout\" of the company.

Do you not understand the entire true MAGA base, the real MAGA base, feels Israel has completely taken over Trump's second term already? Anyone who spends 5 minutes outside of the Twitter echo chamber will see this. There is an avalanche of pissed off people currently. Many of them the young voter base. On top of that, Bibi has been stupidly openly bragging about it on camera! LOL da fuq Then Trump admitted he does whatever his largest donor Miriam Adelson wants during his last Israel visit... ON CAMERA! da fuq Between the Israel takeover of our government, the endless funding to Ukraine still, and the Argentina bailout bullshit, people don't feel they have another 4 years to waste. And the EBT boogeyman situation was the perfect cherry on top in the minds of NYC voters and in other blue/purple areas. They voted for what was promised, \"a Golden Age of America\" and they don't see it at all. There isn't a hint of it on the radar in their minds. NYC didn't really have any viable candidates, it was like choosing which end of a shit stick to lick. It's been declining since 9/11. Another problem is Democrats pay their shills and protesters, MAGA goes to jobs and works. There's a problem right there.

If you always vote Republican and believe everything is fine with Israel and you love Levine, Shapiro and Netanyahu you'll continue to vote against Dems despite Fuentes getting some media attention.

I don\u2019t agree with him completely or with some of his tactics, but the Neocons want him gone. You should ask yourself why? Why does Mark Levin want him gone? Why does Ben Shapiro want him gone? Why does Randy Fine want him gone? Why does Lady Lindsey want him gone? Newsflash, Fuentes isn\u2019t going anywhere and his followers will help decide elections in the future.

Why would this equal an existential crisis for the American patriotic right?  Answer: it wouldn't. Unless Israel actually does have the literal means to destroy us. Which would mean that Nick would actually be right. Which means that the psyop is actually coming from Israel. I've seen them absolutely flooding the zone with unending torrents of \"Christian Zionist\" posts on X to try to control, literally, the Christian religion.  And so now I have to look with jaundiced eye the source of these doctrines in the Christian church.  And so now I have to revisit the source and the foundation for my beliefs (the Bible) and am that much more convinced that this is an attempt by Zionists to hijack the Western church. So psyops?  I know where those are coming from.  I am not fooled for one second. And so I have a clearer view than ever of who the enemies of freedom really are.  And it's sad.  I did not want to become what is described in popular media as \"antisemitic\" or a \"conspiracy theorist.\"  It is really sad.  But the truth is that people who know and believe the truth are being pushed to the margins of society. This is not an accident.

And because this Unit 8200 asshole could not defend this sicko jew, they deleted the friggin post! XD That tells you its all about publicity and narrative framing.

Every single action, every word they say, is to divide conservatives and scapegoat entire races. They are lower humans and should be treated just like the Woke Left. They claim to be MAGA but do not share Western virtues, they do not share Trump's values, and most important, they do not share AMERICAN values positions on politics.  Instead they demand those values are what they want, and preach hatred. Most are White or Christian Nationalists making them genuinely immoral based on Bible and unamerican, based on 250 years of common history. They are fake patriots.\nThe fakest in fact!!! They are not MAGA, even if they argue otherwise. And that is why we have websites like this one. So people who use a movement like MAGA as a disguise have a place to jerk each other off. Keeps them away from the mainstream and in the fringes where they belong. Musk see's their comments. As do the rest of us. They are in fact the dangerous racist contingent that Democrats (and others) use to justify their campaign of hate and ostracization against all of the rest of us, and the Groypers/Woke Right play right into their hands. Its overdue that we made a clear separation between the WOKE RIGHT Jew Haters and mainstream MAGA. And we are going to, and in a big way.  We are going to make sure America see's you as separate from MAGA and Trump because you are. The rest of us are not going along with your Prison Cafeteria political system. And we will make sure your CIA handler Jesuit Scum get the fucking message. Many of us no longer care why you are this way, and do not share your views on society about race. We understand that open borders was weapoinized and is not the same as legitimate regular and sustainable immigration levels. (Which is what made America) The WOKE RIGHT view is effectively a prisoner/convict level functioning. We are better people then them. We do not run the country like a Prison Cafeteria. You want to sit at a table that is not your race, you have that right. The important thing is to quarantine radicals online, isolate them, and make sure Groypers and Far Right stand all alone in a echo chamber. And when young boys are misled and espouse these racial beliefs we must take them aside, and re-educate them on Western Culture starting with Ancient Greece and Individual Freedom. Their fathers were not good enough men to teach them that you judge individuals on merit, and that stereotypes are not the full picture. It sounds simple, but there is a % of hate filled lower class, lower intellects, lower spirits, whom genuinely need to hate. Usually unresolved mommy/daddy issues they come by honestly and do not know how to cope with. They need a simple outlet, a group of OTHERS they can point at and blame for everything. And that is natural, what is wrong is the way the radical WOKE RIGHT / Groypers take advantage of that need, and mislead them, contributing to the delinquency of minors and many others. Its the same as Woke Left. If the CIA wanted to divide Conservatives it would create exactly the kind of thing Carlson, Fuentes, and others are pushing. Elon is wise to put a stop to it, and its good that these scumbags are forced to fight it out on fringe websites like this one. The Woke Right is just as despicable and disgusting as the Woke Left. Very much so. The only difference is they are smaller and their hate is inverse. Beyond that its the same collectivism, and looks very much like another managed PsyOp like the Woke Left or Q were. All based on Jew Hate and harming Israel to make it yet more repulsive.. They cannot hide it, even when they talk about other stuff, their transparent, the people see through them and their CIA/NGO contrived hate. The world see's them, despite their games.

Why do his followers not want to talk about the elephant in the room?? permalink parent award report block reply medicpatriot 0 points 6 days ago That take kind of reminds me of the \u201cyou talk like a fag\u201d idiots from the movie Idiocracy. permalink parent award report block reply DaBirdisDaWord 2 points 6 days ago He\u2019s literally an outed Faggot, we\u2019re not even talking solely about his overt femininity. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nmedicpatriot 0 points 6 days ago That take kind of reminds me of the \u201cyou talk like a fag\u201d idiots from the movie Idiocracy. permalink parent award report block reply DaBirdisDaWord 2 points 6 days ago He\u2019s literally an outed Faggot, we\u2019re not even talking solely about his overt femininity. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nDaBirdisDaWord 2 points 6 days ago He\u2019s literally an outed Faggot, we\u2019re not even talking solely about his overt femininity. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nPongpagongbatibot 1 points 6 days ago Many of Nick's fanboys are Iranian and Muslim trolls permalink parent award report block reply\npatriotpodcast 0 points 6 days ago Comment removed by community filter, pending further review. permalink parent award report block reply DaBirdisDaWord -1 points 6 days ago I offended you by rightly calling out Fuentes for being effeminate and being outed as an actual faggot that likes men sexually?
