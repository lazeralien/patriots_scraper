Trees breath oxygen the same as we do. Its called respiration. They just so happen to create more oxygen than they use when making their carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 4 days ago You're downvoted, but you're right. During the day, trees use sunlight, water and CO2 to fix sugars to store that energy. At night, they do respiration where they take oxygen in and break down those sugars for the energy they need to grow similar to what animals do. This is why hospitals limit the amount of plants patients can have in their hospital rooms. During the day, everything is fine. At night, the plants start sucking up the oxygen in the room. https://www.pthorticulture.com/en-us/training-center/basics-of-plant-respiration It's almost like people never bothered to wonder where the carbohydrates in vegetables come from and why the plants need those carbohydrates. Photosynthesis is CO2 + H2O + energy = carbohydrate. Respiration is Carbohydrate + 02 = H20 + CO2 + Energy. permalink parent award report block reply Zskills 24 points 5 days ago Maximizing surface area being the common factor permalink award report block reply MAGABOND 14 points 5 days ago This photo is one of the reasons I became a believer, after a long journey of enlightenment. permalink award report block reply Constantin2024 1 points 5 days ago Stephen Meyer's lectures were what did it for me.

Grasses have a natural growth spurt where they grow extremely fast. Any man who mows his lawn knows that the grass grows like crazy after being cut, but after it gets long, it slows down. They think the yearly greening of large grasslands like the steps of mongolia, the African savannah, or the North American plains does more for oxygen/c02 cycle than the rainforests. permalink award report block reply TooLazy 7 points 5 days ago I have heard that algae produces more oxygen than trees. I always thought it was because of the volume of it, but it would make sense that the shorter life cycle would drive that as well. permalink parent award report block reply SPEDMan64 3 points 5 days ago Phytoplankton is what you're thinking of.
