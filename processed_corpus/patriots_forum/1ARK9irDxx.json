WTF is Trump thinking? permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 10 points 2 days ago Yeah, not a good look, but a sign of how bad things really are. Not really his fault though. I remember when the 30 year mortgage came out and everyone screamed bloody murder, but it was the only way some people could afford a house. Now it's what nearly everyone does and they don't think much of it because it's the only way to afford a home. A home should take ten years to pay off, but here we are. Gonna get ugly if things don't turn around. He's expected to lose tariffs on Wednesday. That will really hurt the MAGA agenda. permalink parent award report block reply Shmioighan 7 points 2 days ago One thing I learned about people who do not understand interest or debt is that they literally only care about the monthly payment.

The_Highlander 6 points 2 days ago Kek permalink award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 5 points 2 days ago You guys laugh, but he\u2019s the voice of reason in this insane world where you\u2019ll own nothing and be \u201chappy\u201d. permalink award report block reply HoganP 5 points 2 days ago 99% of the times people disagree with Dave Ramsey it's because they can't handle being told what they don't want to hear.  Finance is at the top of the list of things that people should never be emotional about, yet everyone is emotional about it, directly or indirectly.  Half of them just think they know something better when it's really just ego, emotion, and confirmation bias. permalink parent award report block reply MakeAmericaRichAgain 5 points 2 days ago I watched a clip of his show one time where a guy was underwater on the value of his car. Ramsey told him to sell it. 30 seconds later, he told the guy to pick up a second job driving for doordash. Dave Ramsey and his anti debt bullshit kept a ton of people from buying their first house at a reasonable price. He should not be listened to. permalink award report block reply geckogreen OP 11 points 2 days ago His mortgage advice is pretty bad. He says you don't need a credit score just make a bigger down payment on your house. Unfortunately banks just don't work that way. permalink parent award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 4 points 2 days ago Society would be better if it wasn\u2019t all built on debt and fiat. If federal government wasn\u2019t backing 30 year mortgages, housing would be much cheaper and more available.  Debt is slavery ran by banking cartel. permalink parent award report block reply HoganP 4 points 2 days ago That's not what he says, at all. permalink parent award report block reply indigo_truther 5 points 2 days ago Some people have overpriced cars.  Selling it, buying a cheaper one, and driving for Doordash aren't necessary exclusive. permalink parent award report block reply HoganP 5 points 2 days ago Most people have overpriced cars and financing them, serially, is one of the most common things that drag them down financially throughout their working lives. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 4 points 2 days ago You are correct, that is stupid. A house is not like credit card debt. It saves you money over renting when calculated over a couple of decades. It is 'good' debt. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 11 points 2 days ago Ramsey supported mortgages as the only reasonable form of debt last time I listened. Of course, he probably wasn't talking about these 50 year monstrosities. People tell a lot of lies about Ramsey. Not that I think he's without issues. permalink parent award report block reply HoganP 2 points 2 days ago A lot of them are right here in this thread. And I've heard him discuss 50 year mortgages, long before this recent thing, and he thinks they are insane.  He advocates 15 year mortgages because it reels you in to staying within your means in your purchase and you will actually pay it off in a reasonable timeframe even if you don't make extra payments. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 1 points 2 days ago I've never listened to him, but none of what you said surprised me. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 1 points 2 days ago I used to listen to him on my commute every day for years. You twig onto the basics pretty quickly but the call-ins are often amusing like the guy who wanted to borrow $30k to start an exotic bird breeding business. Which I laughed at but then had to keep a straight face when one of my wife's family did basically the same thing. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Shmioighan 3 points 2 days ago The problem with 'good' debt is that it's like treading water with an anchor made of gold.

These are supposed to be aimed at younger couples.  In a few years, they have some equity built up, credit should have gone up. Sell, buy bigger on shorter loan. permalink award report block reply Hantif 8 points 2 days ago I've paid off two mortgages, still live in the latest one. Parents and in laws paid off theirs, sister and sister in law have as well. Some people know how to be content, not always seeking bigger houses. permalink parent award report block reply f_bastiat 2 points 1 day ago Agreed, we added onto our home when we had more kids and needed more space, I paid off my house in my early 30s, no desire to move, did plenty of that in my early 20s. Home is where you make it. permalink parent award report block reply FreeFire 3 points 2 days ago The whole---the entirety---of mortgages, home loans is a BANK SCAM , with the credit scores and other crap.

Some lender and some borrower both want to enter into this ridiculous contract then fair enough.  You buy a house at 20 and at 70 (if you are still alive) you own it.  And you are effectively renting.  Almost all of the money you pay goes to interest.  But the gov IS backing this.  Which is unconstitutional and also distorts the markets.  And as such the gov is encouraging serfdom.  You never really own anything (because you die before you get it) and the gov owns your debt and holds it over you. permalink award report block reply Mungo 2 points 2 days ago Kek permalink award report block reply PleaseHonk 1 points 2 days ago Lolzz permalink award report block reply Droford 1 points 2 days ago Or the 10 year car loan permalink award report block reply f_bastiat 1 points 1 day ago Kek permalink award report block reply Givesgunstogrannies 1 points 2 days ago \ud83e\udd23 permalink award report block reply MemoryHoleyeO 1 points 1 day ago Give me .5 interest rate and I'll pay it off in a few years permalink award report block reply\nHappyFunBall 32 points 2 days ago All of Dave Ramsey's \"advice\" could fit on a single index card. permalink award report block reply South_Florida_Guy 38 points 2 days ago \"Pay off all of your debt\" \"Don't get into debt\" permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 16 points 2 days ago Well, I mean, that's about it.

Well worth it if you make it, will kill you if you can't, and not enough people have the foresight or decisiveness to drop it in time (if anyone can tell when that is at all.) permalink parent award report block reply\nzooty 11 points 2 days ago Ramsey supported mortgages as the only reasonable form of debt last time I listened. Of course, he probably wasn't talking about these 50 year monstrosities. People tell a lot of lies about Ramsey. Not that I think he's without issues. permalink parent award report block reply HoganP 2 points 2 days ago A lot of them are right here in this thread. And I've heard him discuss 50 year mortgages, long before this recent thing, and he thinks they are insane.  He advocates 15 year mortgages because it reels you in to staying within your means in your purchase and you will actually pay it off in a reasonable timeframe even if you don't make extra payments. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 1 points 2 days ago I've never listened to him, but none of what you said surprised me. permalink parent award report block reply zooty 1 points 2 days ago I used to listen to him on my commute every day for years. You twig onto the basics pretty quickly but the call-ins are often amusing like the guy who wanted to borrow $30k to start an exotic bird breeding business.

These are supposed to be aimed at younger couples.  In a few years, they have some equity built up, credit should have gone up. Sell, buy bigger on shorter loan. permalink award report block reply Hantif 8 points 2 days ago I've paid off two mortgages, still live in the latest one. Parents and in laws paid off theirs, sister and sister in law have as well.

Some lender and some borrower both want to enter into this ridiculous contract then fair enough.  You buy a house at 20 and at 70 (if you are still alive) you own it.  And you are effectively renting.  Almost all of the money you pay goes to interest.  But the gov IS backing this.  Which is unconstitutional and also distorts the markets.  And as such the gov is encouraging serfdom.  You never really own anything (because you die before you get it) and the gov owns your debt and holds it over you. permalink award report block reply\nMungo 2 points 2 days ago Kek permalink award report block reply\nPleaseHonk 1 points 2 days ago Lolzz permalink award report block reply\nDroford 1 points 2 days ago Or the 10 year car loan permalink award report block reply\nf_bastiat 1 points 1 day ago Kek permalink award report block reply\nGivesgunstogrannies 1 points 2 days ago \ud83e\udd23 permalink award report block reply\nMemoryHoleyeO 1 points 1 day ago Give me .5 interest rate and I'll pay it off in a few years permalink award report block reply"}
