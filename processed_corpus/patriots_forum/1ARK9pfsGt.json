We are the way to a restored and fortified Republic . We stand against all globalist trash and foreign influence plus invasions brought on us by a worthless Uniparty and the billionaires that bought them. We must keep our eyes on the prize and realize that Trump will be gone in 3 and we must continue this fight with this type of energy and attitude . We have to unite all who are MAGA AF as a force that can't be fucked with . Our vision is simple,America( ns) First and only . Shut down all immigration for at least 6 or 8 decades until the newbies assimilate or kick them the fuck out. Make our country Christian Only. Keep the best and yeet the rest. All visa abusers must be stopped and uno reverse their asses out of here. Rebuild our entire infrastructure,ignite manufacturing,drill to the core,yeet all uniparty fags out in the next few cycles by replacing with extremely vetted patriots that will vote in term limits ,cancel Obama care,continue deporting illegals by any means necessary,transparecy and accountability on tap,create great paying jobs for Americans ,reign in or abolish the Intel cartel,abolish The Fed,IRS,DOE,etc,Abolish The Patriot Act,Abolish all red flag and any other laws against the 2nd,definitely abolish any laws punishing for saying hurty words about the chosen ones,abolish AIPAC,ADL,Islamic everything,dualies,get lobbyists money out of elections,abolish all NGOs and start anew with real oversight,fortify our elections ,make it paper ballots,same day voting,and possibly a holiday for national elections,Bring God back into everything. Put Americas way of life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness up front and center. Incentivise American married couples to raise huge families to get our numbers up. Reverse the replacement bullshit. Penalize any caught still pushing commie gobblygook like DEI or ESG bullshit. Break up Blackrock and their ilk and sue them fuckers into the abyss for illegal discrimination and crimes against humanity,get Big Pharma prosecuted for the knowingly and willingly destroying,maiming,murdering many innocents for money . Money they stole from all. That's just the beginning. We have a long road ahead and this is just a part of what we need to get America on top of the World as we should be.
