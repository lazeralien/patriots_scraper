This whole site has become feminized by posts like this. permalink parent award report block reply Prandogolio OP 1 points 4 hours ago I am one of the people back in the_donald days.  I used to complain about off topic posts all the time up until yesterday.  I would ping the mods and ask them to weigh in about these stupid off-topic posts and they would ignore me.  Everyone in the comments just got mad at me and told me to \"lighten up\" and downvote me to hell. So I decided to just go with the flow. I decided to just give the people what they want.  Look at the upvotes I get for taking random retarded posts from c/funny and reposting them here with moronic emoji titles.  Everyone loves it. Don't be mad at me. I'm just adapting.  Be mad at the mods for letting it become a stupid shit hole.  Be mad at all the morons upvoting this garbage.  I'm just proving how stupid it has become. permalink parent award report block reply Thrilly 1 points 4 hours ago I'm telling you directly, that not everyone loves it...the upvotes you're getting are from people who just press the upvote on everything so it lights up.  It's fucking gay. permalink parent award report block reply view 3 more comments...
