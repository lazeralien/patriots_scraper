If the \"conservative right\" is going to destroy anyone that doesn't 'toe the party line,' then it is no better than the left.

A private citizen can choose not to listen to or amplify anyone they disagree with. permalink parent award report block reply Goozmania -26 points 5 days ago America should be multi-ethnic. I support civic nationalism in America; regardless of what people look like, if they are \"culturally white\" they are welcome here. Europe, however, should not be. Europe is the ancestral homeland of white people, and should remain as such. If any European country exceeds 5% in non-white population, there is a massive problem... and they all have. Edit: And my reasoning for this is that, throughout the last 400 years, America has invited people from various countries, both from non-English Europe and outside of Europe, for various reasons... indigenous population on conquered land (latinos and natives), slavery (blacks), railroad construction (chinese and mexicans), hawaiian plantation farming (phillipinos, koreans, chinese and japanese), farming in california (more mexicans), cannery and fishery workers (see hawaiian plantation), the construction of the state of Florida (bahamian and carribbean). permalink award report block reply Electricutie 34 points 5 days ago America should be hyper-majority white.  I say this as a child of legal Chinese immigrants.  American culture and history will be eroded and destroyed if it is not majority white.  I don't want to see that happen. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpAndGodWin 6 points 5 days ago Whites are only seven percent of the world's population so naturally as minorities the US should be overwhelmingly white as a 'natural preserve' to protect them against the many tribalistic threats. permalink parent award report block reply genericamerican69 2 points 5 days ago I literally said that it wouldn't make sense to teach the history of America to an entire generation of non western kids who are brown and couldn't see themselves as members of the civilization that produced the founding fathers and the Anglo american culture. If everyone in the country is Asian and Indian, how would it make sense to teach a history that is essentially an extension of white people's civilizational history? This is why they are rewriting history with all the movies/TV shows/commercials. The globalist technocrat corporations would prefer the US to simply be the vehicle for their products and they cant endlessly expand their markets if the US explicitly belongs to its majority founding demographic (english speaking white people), so they need to replace everyone as quickly as possible with non westerners. Therefore most of the people in north America will be Indians Asians and mexicans by the end of the century. It will no longer make sense to teach western history at that point. For some reason people just dont understand that even though it's just basic math and cause and effect. permalink parent award report block reply HumblePepe 17 points 5 days ago It always have been. Germans. British. Scottish. Irish. Polish. Portuguese. Spanish. French. And, many, many more, all living together and putting down ancient grudges for the new world. But because they all constitute \"White\" that's not the correct multi-ethnic ideal. And it's only one way for other races. Whites give up their identity for the sake of multiculturalism while every other race keeps their own. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 12 points 5 days ago Access to White people is not a human right. But don't worry. Enough people see it your way that nothing will change. The thing is that you're wrong. America was great because it took the best of the White population of the West and let them be free. America needs to be a White supremacist nation to be America. That's what it has always been. A White country, ruled by Whites.\nCivic nationalism is a cope by still too afraid to be called racist. permalink parent award report block reply LordCommissarYarrick 8 points 5 days ago Someone forgot about the various exclusion acts and immigration laws as well as removals. White countries were always prioritized; asians, slavs, greeks, turks,  africans, arabs, dot indians were all barred or had heavy quotas placed on them. Americans born prior to 1940s would be horrified at what it has become with synagogues, asiatic temples, mosques, and pagan monkey god statues being blatantly present or US politicians celebrating Indian holidays. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 4 points 5 days ago I wouldn't say \"SHOULD be multi ethnic\", but the reality of US identity is that while majority Anglo Christian in origin, culture, and nature, the body of the national identity has at least since the Civil War been compacted by all manner of global minority for whatever reason that minority found itself here. US identitarianism, for right or wrong, can't ever really \"escape\" its multi ethnic build: its identity should be based off of citizenship, and the status of citizenship needs to be severely scrutinized going back 100+ years European nations have no such foundational or cultural tieback and should absolutely make their national identities based solely on ethnicity permalink parent award report block reply load 12 more comments...

But you do you. permalink parent award report block reply\nTrumpAndGodWin 2 points 5 days ago It wasn't softball and it's not a mistake to interview anyone of any kind, anyone against free speech should be exiled. permalink parent award report block reply Constantin2024 1 points 4 days ago You do realize that the whole \"free speech\" Amendment bars the GOVERNMENT from curtailing speech, correct? A private citizen can choose not to listen to or amplify anyone they disagree with. permalink parent award report block reply\nConstantin2024 1 points 4 days ago You do realize that the whole \"free speech\" Amendment bars the GOVERNMENT from curtailing speech, correct?

I support civic nationalism in America; regardless of what people look like, if they are \"culturally white\" they are welcome here. Europe, however, should not be. Europe is the ancestral homeland of white people, and should remain as such. If any European country exceeds 5% in non-white population, there is a massive problem... and they all have. Edit: And my reasoning for this is that, throughout the last 400 years, America has invited people from various countries, both from non-English Europe and outside of Europe, for various reasons... indigenous population on conquered land (latinos and natives), slavery (blacks), railroad construction (chinese and mexicans), hawaiian plantation farming (phillipinos, koreans, chinese and japanese), farming in california (more mexicans), cannery and fishery workers (see hawaiian plantation), the construction of the state of Florida (bahamian and carribbean). permalink award report block reply Electricutie 34 points 5 days ago America should be hyper-majority white.  I say this as a child of legal Chinese immigrants.  American culture and history will be eroded and destroyed if it is not majority white.  I don't want to see that happen. permalink parent award report block reply TrumpAndGodWin 6 points 5 days ago Whites are only seven percent of the world's population so naturally as minorities the US should be overwhelmingly white as a 'natural preserve' to protect them against the many tribalistic threats. permalink parent award report block reply genericamerican69 2 points 5 days ago I literally said that it wouldn't make sense to teach the history of America to an entire generation of non western kids who are brown and couldn't see themselves as members of the civilization that produced the founding fathers and the Anglo american culture. If everyone in the country is Asian and Indian, how would it make sense to teach a history that is essentially an extension of white people's civilizational history? This is why they are rewriting history with all the movies/TV shows/commercials. The globalist technocrat corporations would prefer the US to simply be the vehicle for their products and they cant endlessly expand their markets if the US explicitly belongs to its majority founding demographic (english speaking white people), so they need to replace everyone as quickly as possible with non westerners. Therefore most of the people in north America will be Indians Asians and mexicans by the end of the century. It will no longer make sense to teach western history at that point. For some reason people just dont understand that even though it's just basic math and cause and effect. permalink parent award report block reply HumblePepe 17 points 5 days ago It always have been. Germans. British. Scottish. Irish. Polish. Portuguese. Spanish. French. And, many, many more, all living together and putting down ancient grudges for the new world. But because they all constitute \"White\" that's not the correct multi-ethnic ideal. And it's only one way for other races. Whites give up their identity for the sake of multiculturalism while every other race keeps their own. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 12 points 5 days ago Access to White people is not a human right. But don't worry. Enough people see it your way that nothing will change. The thing is that you're wrong. America was great because it took the best of the White population of the West and let them be free. America needs to be a White supremacist nation to be America. That's what it has always been. A White country, ruled by Whites.\nCivic nationalism is a cope by still too afraid to be called racist. permalink parent award report block reply LordCommissarYarrick 8 points 5 days ago Someone forgot about the various exclusion acts and immigration laws as well as removals. White countries were always prioritized; asians, slavs, greeks, turks,  africans, arabs, dot indians were all barred or had heavy quotas placed on them. Americans born prior to 1940s would be horrified at what it has become with synagogues, asiatic temples, mosques, and pagan monkey god statues being blatantly present or US politicians celebrating Indian holidays. permalink parent award report block reply Dangerous 4 points 5 days ago I wouldn't say \"SHOULD be multi ethnic\", but the reality of US identity is that while majority Anglo Christian in origin, culture, and nature, the body of the national identity has at least since the Civil War been compacted by all manner of global minority for whatever reason that minority found itself here. US identitarianism, for right or wrong, can't ever really \"escape\" its multi ethnic build: its identity should be based off of citizenship, and the status of citizenship needs to be severely scrutinized going back 100+ years European nations have no such foundational or cultural tieback and should absolutely make their national identities based solely on ethnicity permalink parent award report block reply load 12 more comments...\nElectricutie 34 points 5 days ago America should be hyper-majority white.
