If you really are a chemist, you should know that a single additional carbon can make a massive difference.  See methanol vs ethanol.

The mercury in the vaccines is ethyl mercury. One little additional carbon. They say that renders it safe in vaccines. As a chemist who handles organometallics every day of my life, I don\u2019t fucking believe them. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago I handled liquid mercury obtained from broken thermometers quite a bit, just for fun. Good to know it's not as scary as I was told :) permalink parent award report block reply Yawnz13 -1 points 6 days ago The \"mercury\" in vaccines is thimerosal.  While ethyl mercury is used to make it (technically a chloride salt of ethyl mercury), thimerosal is way more than just a methyl group. If you really are a chemist, you should know that a single additional carbon can make a massive difference.  See methanol vs ethanol.  Ethanol has been consumed by humanity on a regular basis and in large quantities for thousands of years with fairly negligible side effects overall.  Methanol will kill you at around 30 milliliters. Even then, it isn't even used in most vaccines anyway. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments...\nSicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago I handled liquid mercury obtained from broken thermometers quite a bit, just for fun.

What was used \u2014 starting in the 1930s \u2014 was a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal AND WAS to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination This was important because in the early 20th century, some vaccines (like diphtheria and smallpox) became contaminated after being opened \u2014 and that contamination caused severe infections and even deaths.

What's most amazing is that it's no longer used because it had an eternal shelf life, which made companies want to get rid of it. One bottle was enough for a lifetime for an entire family. I still have one and I bet it works well, side effects and all it still achieved it's purpose. permalink parent award report block reply spinometer2 4 points 6 days ago kills everything! let's inject it! permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago Merthiolate hurt like hell, my Mom always used it. permalink parent award report block reply\nspinometer2 4 points 6 days ago kills everything! let's inject it! permalink parent award report block reply\nSicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago Merthiolate hurt like hell, my Mom always used it. permalink parent award report block reply\nJaqen 6 points 6 days ago Sodium is a metal that explodes when exposed to water. Yet you can combine it with chlorine, a deadly gas, to make table salt, which has none of the dangerous qualities of its components. Mercury does tend to retain its toxicity when combined with other elements though. permalink parent award report block reply\nHillarysFUPA 36 points 6 days ago Oh dear God.
