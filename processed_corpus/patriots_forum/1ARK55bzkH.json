{"id": "1ARK55bzkH", "contents": "533 It was so interesting yesterday when our Great Senator from Louisiana, John Kennedy, introduced a Bill in an attempt to withhold Members of Congress from getting paid, and Rand Paul, who never votes for anything, tried to stop it, because he wanted to be paid!

What a fucking disappointment that jackass is. permalink award report block reply heightnoise 11 points 5 days ago Attorney here. It's because Rand Paul strictly interprets the Constitution and believes the 27th Amendment does not allow for the affecting of Congressional salaries by law alone. Only by amendment. As a strict Textualist myself, I actually agree with his interpretation. He was legally (though imo not morally) correct in voting against it. That said, he needs to feel the temperature in the room and not die on stupid hills like his own paycheck. Here's the text of the 27th Amendment: No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened. permalink award report block reply BobbyTables18c 1 points 4 days ago I am not a Biologist nor Constitutional scholar. It sounds like the pay withholding cannot affect current members. Fine. Pass the law now. Might as well do some term limits while you are in there. permalink parent award report block reply heightnoise 1 points 4 days ago By my interpretation, they could pass a law punishing any senators that did not vote to open the govt who win as incumbents in their elections next year (idk how many Dems there are up at bat but that would be Constitutionally sound). Frankly, that amendment needs to be repealed via an Article 5 or something, if we are actually going to fix this damn mess. permalink parent award report block reply DJT4MoreYears 1 points 4 days ago There is no law.

Yeah, the same values you conservatives are perfectly willing to shit on when they become inconvenient obstacles to your goals. Even when I agree with the conservatives (as I often do, at least 85-90% of the time), I still will not stand for disobedience of our laws in the name of efficiency or \"doing the right thing.\" No, the \"right thing\" is to do the right thing while ALSO being legally. Don't like it? Change the law. Don't like how we vote? Don't proffer.shitty laws that are unconstitutional on their face. I heard Kennedy's speech on the floor, claiming his bill does not offend the 27th Amendment, and after reading the text I think he's flat out wrong. isnt he supposed to be arresting fauci or something? He can't arrest him and you know it, quite blowing smoke. All he can do is refer him for prosecution. He's done all he legally can, if youre pissed about it then blame the actual person responsible for Fauci being uncharged: The bimbo in the AG office. https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/reps/senator-rand-paul-re-refers-dr-anthony-fauci-to-the-department-of-justice/ permalink parent award report block reply HaSumBro 1 points 5 days ago That why I don't vote for lawyers, they're evil and justify evil by quoting the law. permalink parent award report block reply heightnoise 1 points 4 days ago You sound like someone who's ex-wife cleaned him out in the divorce. permalink parent award report block reply HaSumBro 1 points 4 days ago Um no...\nOur country has been run by lawyers for far too long that's why...

But my interpretation is that withholding payment does not affect the statutory compensation that is due;  only the time elapsed for which the compensation is received.  Furthermore, this action is not just specific to Congress, but to all Federal employees. So I beg to differ, but I believe that the 27th Amendment has not been violated with this proposal. permalink parent award report block reply Trump454748 8 points 5 days ago Hey Rand, they can still insider trade and take \u201ccampaign donations\u201d to make ends meet, so what\u2019s the big deal? permalink award report block reply jonnyuno 7 points 5 days ago Where's the ones on here defending Rand?
