Just because we know Schiff did some treasonous stuff doesn\u2019t mean a jury will convict him of it (especially if his trial is in DC where he\u2019ll just get off via jury nullification). On the other hand, mortgage fraud is pretty cut and dry. Just like Al Capone was convicted not of his mobster activities itself but of tax fraud his mobster activities financed. permalink parent award report block reply load 5 more comments...

The problem is if Schiff gets tossed they'll install Newsome or someone equally loathsome. Imagine getting bug-chasing pedophile Scott Weiner to replace Schiff. It's a possibility.

Think about it. They spyed on his campaign. They stole an election. They dragged his name through the mud. Made him a felon, told the people he was a rapist and they tried to put his own son in jail.
