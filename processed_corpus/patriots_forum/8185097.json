Not to mention the latest Trump interview where he sounds like Joe Biden denying people's economic struggles. What the hell is going on? This is not what we voted for. If we end up with a socialist president in 2028 Donald Trump will be to blame because of stupid economic policies like this. Why not vote socialist when even the previous Republican president was in favor of handing out free money?
