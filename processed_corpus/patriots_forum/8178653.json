I\u2019d never heard of colorblindness until I was about 7. My mom had sent my dad to the store and while there to pick up a pack of pink Charmin toilet paper. He came home with green (a color my mom detested in TP) and when she asked him why he got green, he said it looked pink to him. That was when I learned he was colorblind. So we females of the family had to remember his colorblindness in the rare times we needed him to pick up anything for us \u2026.and wanted a certain color. (But several years later Charmin stopped making colored TP, so that solved that issue.) permalink parent award report block reply GuerillaYourDreams 8 points 3 days ago I find that very cool.
