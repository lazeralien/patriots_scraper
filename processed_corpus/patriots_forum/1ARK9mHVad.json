Think about it. This shit started going off the rails the minute bb showed up trying to start a war with Iran. Kirk, Elon, and all the youth were suddenly and magically removed from the admin. Group chats were leaked. Private meetings taped. All by Jews. Now? Oh Noes white man you\u2019re too dumb to do this job. Oh no white man you can\u2019t afford a home? Here\u2019s super usury. Oh no white man you can\u2019t go to college we have to let in a million Chinese. permalink parent award report block reply Antiluminati 19 points 8 hours ago When did Trump start receiving tiny hat money? Wile I don\u2019t think Trump has betrayed us it does seem that he made a deal with the devil at some level with all this. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 37 points 8 hours ago Trump got literally a quarter of a billion dollars from Mariam Adelson. Who is a rich Vegas gambling jewess. The short version is his cabinet is filled with Zionists and they\u2019re doing their typical destructive policy. permalink parent award report block reply sordfysh PRO 3 points 7 hours ago She made her money from gambling? Oof. Remember that to defeat the Zionists, you must defeat the Jew within yourself first. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... TallestSkill -10 points 7 hours ago Viewer01, you sound like a man staring at a thunderstorm and blaming the clouds for being Jewish. Miriam Adelson\u2019s donations were public, legal, and entirely predictable in a political system built on super PACs. Every major campaign takes money from billionaires, because Washington is designed to make that unavoidable. Trump took money from Adelson, Thiel, Icahn, Uihlein, and a dozen others. That is not \u201cZionism,\u201d it is campaign finance law written by the same establishment that wants the populist right dead. The irony is that Trump was the first president in decades to govern against donor consensus. He wrecked TPP, froze new wars, called out China, and put working-class wages above Wall Street indexes. Those are things no \u201cZionist cabinet\u201d would ever have approved. You are mistaking token diplomatic gestures for control. You want to know what\u2019s actually destructive policy? The Fed printing trillions, the universities importing visa labor, the Pentagon laundering hundreds of billions through foreign contractors, the Chamber of Commerce buying both parties, and the bureaucrats regulating America out of existence. None of that requires a menorah, just greed and contempt for the nation. This movement either matures into a disciplined nationalist force or collapses into a paranoid message board cult. If your only political theory is \u201cthe Jews did it,\u201d you are not fighting globalism, you are auditioning for its sideshow. permalink parent award report block reply view 2 more comments... someguy7738 18 points 7 hours ago Honestly Trump has always been some what beholden to Israel, his kids have married into the tribe, but it had seemed, at least a for a little while, that his America First goals slightly overrode that. permalink parent award report block reply Decepticons-superior 9 points 6 hours ago It amazes me that someone like Ivanka can convert from Christianity to Judaism. I submit that this is not even possible. You weren\u2019t Christian to begin with if you can do that. permalink parent award report block reply TallestSkill -12 points 7 hours ago someguy7738, calling marriage \u201cjoining the tribe\u201d is the kind of barstool anthropology that confuses gossip for geopolitics. Trump\u2019s son-in-law did not hypnotize him with a dreidel. Trump has been pro-Israel because every U.S. president for seventy years has been pro-Israel. It is institutional inertia, not secret conversion. The difference is that Trump was the first president in modern history to break the \u201cIsrael first, America second\u201d rule in practice. He cut off endless wars, pressured NATO freeloaders, crushed ISIS, sanctioned Iran without launching another Middle East quagmire, and forced Israel to make regional peace deals instead of demanding more American troops. That is what \u201cAmerica First\u201d actually looks like. Alliances serve our interests or they do not exist. You are mistaking diplomacy for devotion. The same man who moved the embassy to Jerusalem also told Netanyahu to his face that America would not fight his wars. That is not servitude, that is transactional realism. If the movement cannot distinguish between family ties and national betrayal, it will keep chasing bloodlines while the real traitors, bureaucrats, bankers, and global consultants, keep selling the country piece by piece. The test of loyalty is policy, not who someone\u2019s daughter married. permalink parent award report block reply view 4 more comments... flashersenpai 17 points 8 hours ago I believe 20M term 1, 90M term 2 both from Miriam Adelson 2M to unseat Thomas Massie from Adelson and two other Zionists, supposedly plus an additional 20M.

You are describing global corruption and calling it a synagogue. You are confusing Wall Street, Davos, and K Street with Jerusalem. Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d was not with Jews. It was with the same donor and consultant machine that every modern politician must navigate to compete. He walked into a rigged casino and still managed to flip the table for four years. That took courage, not conspiracy. The people hollowing out this country are not defined by religion. They are defined by class. The permanent managerial caste believes it owns the nation, and it will rent it out to anyone for a profit. That includes Chinese nationals, Silicon Valley tech lords, NGO parasites, and yes, a few Israeli lobbyists too. The common thread is money and power, not a menorah. You are repeating a century-old script written to keep working people stupid and divided. Every time populism gains traction, someone yells \u201cJewish puppet\u201d to fracture the coalition. The bankers and bureaucrats love that. They drink champagne every time another right-winger trades political analysis for racial mysticism. If you want to restore the social compact, stop chanting about hats and start naming institutions. Name the banks, the NGOs, the Ivy League foundations, the consulting firms, the defense contractors. Name the empire, not a religion. The movement fails the moment it stops telling the truth. permalink parent award report block reply NonbinaryPotatohead 10 points 7 hours ago Trump literally admitted to being bought by Miriam Adelson live on air while visiting Israel recently.

Every time there is a danger of the US finding a way out of Ukraine or the middle east, little Marco goes and throws a spanner in the works.  Rubio, Bondi, Patel all need to go.  And yes, Trump needs to tell Bibi to solve his own problems without American help. permalink parent award report block reply TallestSkill -13 points 7 hours ago Viewer01, you are confusing cause and effect.\nAmerica did not lose its footing because of \u201cthe Jews.\u201d It lost its footing because our own political class, white, black, Christian, atheist, male, and female, sold the nation out for global profit margins and Beltway prestige. Blaming Jews for that is lazy Marxist thinking with a cross necklace on. It is a cope. The Israel lobby did not offshore American industry. It did not design the H-1B scam. It did not write the DEI bureaucracies strangling our businesses. All that was done by the same Ivy-credentialed ruling caste that waves the rainbow flag and cashes checks from Beijing. You are right that \u201cZionist boomers\u201d exist. They are a symptom of the Cold War alliance system, not a secret religion. And yes, BB and Neocons pushed Iran hawkishness. But that is not Judaism. That is the same military-industrial machine that used Christianity and \u201cfreedom\u201d as marketing slogans for half a century. If you cannot tell the difference between a religion and a lobby, between a citizen and a subversive, you are helping the real enemy, the global managerial elite, divide and neutralize us. They want right-wing populists chasing ghosts instead of power. This movement is supposed to defend our civilization. That means defending the truth. If your analysis begins and ends with \u201cthe Jews,\u201d you have already admitted you cannot handle reality. permalink parent award report block reply ProdigalPlaneswalker 3 points 6 hours ago America did not lose its footing because of \u201cthe Jews.\u201d It lost its footing because our own political class, white, black, Christian, atheist, male, and female, sold the nation out for global profit margins and Beltway prestige. Don't blame the people doing the bribing. Only blame the people taking the bribes. permalink parent award report block reply TallestSkill -4 points 6 hours ago ProdigalPlaneswalker, you are repeating a kindergarten-level moralization that is useless in the real world. Blame without analysis changes nothing. If you only go after the bribe-takers, the architects of the system, the lobbyists, the banks, the consulting firms, and the regulatory cartels remain untouched. They design the incentives, write the rules, and rig the game. The people accepting bribes are symptoms, not causes. They act because the system rewards betrayal. Punching shadows at the margins while the real power brokers operate freely is why populist movements collapse. Understanding corruption requires mapping the network, identifying leverage points, and dismantling the incentives. Moral outrage alone achieves nothing. If your strategy is to blame only the hand that takes money, you are training yourself to fail while the global managerial elite laughs and consolidates control. The battle is structural, not personal. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 3 points 6 hours ago 'Blaming Jews for that is lazy Marxist thinking' Lol, well Jews invented and perpetuated Marxism so it seems like a bit of karma. Look, this has happened a hundred times before. Fair or not we both know where this is going. It's up to the Jews to break the cycle, not the 110th country reacting to it. Break the cycle. Own up to it. Stop the subversion. Stop embracing unfettered immigration as a whole. Every Jewish group of importance embraces both legal and illegal immigration, man. They also punch for leftism. There was on this page just a week ago a prominent Jewish journalist bragging how Jews create and push leftism. So she was surprised at the anti-semitism coming from the free Palestine movement. Stop getting angry at people reacting to your group and noticing what's happening.  Be the change. You know a clever phrase like that was invented by a Jew and not Obama. You guys are over represented in media, law, finance, and government.  The most influential industries to be in. Of course you're gonna catch blame. As well you should. You really can fix this. You start by stopping getting mad at those reacting to it and placing the blame where it belongs. Then shame and change. I have family that is Jewish and I care very much. It would terrible for the cycle to begin again. But it's not in the hands of the people posting here. They can't be you and make those changes. They can only react. Good luck. permalink parent award report block reply TallestSkill -3 points 6 hours ago Awakened, this is exactly the kind of intellectual laziness that keeps the same global managerial class in power. You are turning a structural and political problem into a morality play about one religious group. That is not analysis, that is storytelling for people who want an easy villain. Blaming Jews for Marxism, immigration, or leftism is the oldest deflection in the book. The real power in media, finance, law, and government is class and networks, not religion. Ivy League financiers, multinational corporations, and bureaucratic cartels run the incentives. They hire, fire, lobby, and write policy to maximize profit and influence. Religion is incidental. Bloodlines do not dictate policy, structures do. The moment you treat a group as the cause of systemic corruption, you hand the real architects a free pass. You are telling ordinary Americans that they cannot fight the system unless they chase ghosts. That is exactly what the elite wants: populists distracted by ethnic or religious scapegoats while the ruling class continues hollowing out the nation. If you want change, focus on institutions, not identity. Follow the money, follow the regulations, follow the power. Stop anthropologizing. Otherwise, you are participating in the cycle you claim to fear. All the \u201cgood intentions\u201d in the world cannot save a nation if your strategy is moralizing about ethnicity instead of dismantling power. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... champdog 62 points 9 hours ago Remember, we're also \"stupid\" for even bringing up Epstein, something he campaigned on.

I see that the sharp decline started in 1990 and 1990's, that would correspond to 30-year-olds who were born in the 1960's, and we raised during and after the \"Me\" and \"Hippie\" stuff. The contraceptive pill came into being in the 1960's, and helped change how women viewed their lives and roles, plus feminism intensified. All those things combine into people choosing not to get married and have kids, and that can explain the decline, as much or more as any economic factors or constraints.

That is not \u201cZionism,\u201d it is campaign finance law written by the same establishment that wants the populist right dead.

Trump\u2019s son-in-law did not hypnotize him with a dreidel. Trump has been pro-Israel because every U.S. president for seventy years has been pro-Israel.

Blaming Jews for that is lazy Marxist thinking with a cross necklace on. It is a cope. The Israel lobby did not offshore American industry. It did not design the H-1B scam. It did not write the DEI bureaucracies strangling our businesses. All that was done by the same Ivy-credentialed ruling caste that waves the rainbow flag and cashes checks from Beijing. You are right that \u201cZionist boomers\u201d exist. They are a symptom of the Cold War alliance system, not a secret religion. And yes, BB and Neocons pushed Iran hawkishness. But that is not Judaism. That is the same military-industrial machine that used Christianity and \u201cfreedom\u201d as marketing slogans for half a century.

They design the incentives, write the rules, and rig the game. The people accepting bribes are symptoms, not causes. They act because the system rewards betrayal. Punching shadows at the margins while the real power brokers operate freely is why populist movements collapse. Understanding corruption requires mapping the network, identifying leverage points, and dismantling the incentives. Moral outrage alone achieves nothing.

The battle is structural, not personal. permalink parent award report block reply Awakened 3 points 6 hours ago 'Blaming Jews for that is lazy Marxist thinking' Lol, well Jews invented and perpetuated Marxism so it seems like a bit of karma. Look, this has happened a hundred times before. Fair or not we both know where this is going. It's up to the Jews to break the cycle, not the 110th country reacting to it. Break the cycle. Own up to it. Stop the subversion. Stop embracing unfettered immigration as a whole. Every Jewish group of importance embraces both legal and illegal immigration, man. They also punch for leftism. There was on this page just a week ago a prominent Jewish journalist bragging how Jews create and push leftism. So she was surprised at the anti-semitism coming from the free Palestine movement. Stop getting angry at people reacting to your group and noticing what's happening.  Be the change. You know a clever phrase like that was invented by a Jew and not Obama. You guys are over represented in media, law, finance, and government.  The most influential industries to be in. Of course you're gonna catch blame. As well you should. You really can fix this. You start by stopping getting mad at those reacting to it and placing the blame where it belongs. Then shame and change. I have family that is Jewish and I care very much. It would terrible for the cycle to begin again. But it's not in the hands of the people posting here. They can't be you and make those changes. They can only react. Good luck. permalink parent award report block reply TallestSkill -3 points 6 hours ago Awakened, this is exactly the kind of intellectual laziness that keeps the same global managerial class in power. You are turning a structural and political problem into a morality play about one religious group. That is not analysis, that is storytelling for people who want an easy villain. Blaming Jews for Marxism, immigration, or leftism is the oldest deflection in the book. The real power in media, finance, law, and government is class and networks, not religion. Ivy League financiers, multinational corporations, and bureaucratic cartels run the incentives. They hire, fire, lobby, and write policy to maximize profit and influence. Religion is incidental. Bloodlines do not dictate policy, structures do. The moment you treat a group as the cause of systemic corruption, you hand the real architects a free pass. You are telling ordinary Americans that they cannot fight the system unless they chase ghosts. That is exactly what the elite wants: populists distracted by ethnic or religious scapegoats while the ruling class continues hollowing out the nation. If you want change, focus on institutions, not identity. Follow the money, follow the regulations, follow the power. Stop anthropologizing. Otherwise, you are participating in the cycle you claim to fear. All the \u201cgood intentions\u201d in the world cannot save a nation if your strategy is moralizing about ethnicity instead of dismantling power. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... champdog 62 points 9 hours ago Remember, we're also \"stupid\" for even bringing up Epstein, something he campaigned on.

Own up to it. Stop the subversion. Stop embracing unfettered immigration as a whole. Every Jewish group of importance embraces both legal and illegal immigration, man. They also punch for leftism. There was on this page just a week ago a prominent Jewish journalist bragging how Jews create and push leftism. So she was surprised at the anti-semitism coming from the free Palestine movement. Stop getting angry at people reacting to your group and noticing what's happening.  Be the change. You know a clever phrase like that was invented by a Jew and not Obama. You guys are over represented in media, law, finance, and government.  The most influential industries to be in. Of course you're gonna catch blame. As well you should. You really can fix this. You start by stopping getting mad at those reacting to it and placing the blame where it belongs. Then shame and change. I have family that is Jewish and I care very much. It would terrible for the cycle to begin again. But it's not in the hands of the people posting here. They can't be you and make those changes. They can only react. Good luck. permalink parent award report block reply TallestSkill -3 points 6 hours ago Awakened, this is exactly the kind of intellectual laziness that keeps the same global managerial class in power. You are turning a structural and political problem into a morality play about one religious group. That is not analysis, that is storytelling for people who want an easy villain. Blaming Jews for Marxism, immigration, or leftism is the oldest deflection in the book. The real power in media, finance, law, and government is class and networks, not religion. Ivy League financiers, multinational corporations, and bureaucratic cartels run the incentives. They hire, fire, lobby, and write policy to maximize profit and influence. Religion is incidental. Bloodlines do not dictate policy, structures do. The moment you treat a group as the cause of systemic corruption, you hand the real architects a free pass. You are telling ordinary Americans that they cannot fight the system unless they chase ghosts. That is exactly what the elite wants: populists distracted by ethnic or religious scapegoats while the ruling class continues hollowing out the nation. If you want change, focus on institutions, not identity. Follow the money, follow the regulations, follow the power. Stop anthropologizing. Otherwise, you are participating in the cycle you claim to fear. All the \u201cgood intentions\u201d in the world cannot save a nation if your strategy is moralizing about ethnicity instead of dismantling power. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...\nAntiluminati 19 points 8 hours ago When did Trump start receiving tiny hat money?

Blaming Jews for that is lazy Marxist thinking with a cross necklace on. It is a cope. The Israel lobby did not offshore American industry. It did not design the H-1B scam.

You are right that \u201cZionist boomers\u201d exist. They are a symptom of the Cold War alliance system, not a secret religion. And yes, BB and Neocons pushed Iran hawkishness.

Midterms are fucked period, Dems only need to replay that clip over and over with Trump saying Americans do not have talent. permalink award report block reply\nLadyGrahamsminge 4 points 7 hours ago Well, Trump said that we were going to see the largest mass deportations the world has ever known starting day one.

You retards are living in a fantasy just like troons. Trump is kinda retarded on a lot of topics. He would rather have peace, but if the country is playing hardball, he will bomb them. He IS NOT an isolationist at all. He also loves foreigners stealing middle and upper middle class white collar jobs. He seems to only care about brokie and unskilled illegal immigration. You know, the Americans who pay little to no taxes. High 5 figure, Low 6 figure jobs in corporate America are INFESTED with Indians and Asians on H1-B and no one cares. They cry about the $15 an hour dipshit losing his job to an illegal but fuck the middle class who pay most of the taxes permalink award report block reply\nfriedchicken 2 points 7 hours ago Next do rubio permalink award report block reply\nSenorTrumper 2 points 8 hours ago Who is the biggest warmonger?

Don't need 10 million homes after deportation and visa removals.  In fact, you have a surplus which will create affordability. permalink award report block reply\nrivetjoint2 2 points 7 hours ago 100% permalink award report block reply\nshatmaself 2 points 9 hours ago The graph at bottom is interesting, but I wonder at the true reasons for the drop-off.  I see that the sharp decline started in 1990 and 1990's, that would correspond to 30-year-olds who were born in the 1960's, and we raised during and after the \"Me\" and \"Hippie\" stuff. The contraceptive pill came into being in the 1960's, and helped change how women viewed their lives and roles, plus feminism intensified. All those things combine into people choosing not to get married and have kids, and that can explain the decline, as much or more as any economic factors or constraints. But I agree with the feeling that home-ownership has seemed to be become more and more difficult to attain over time. permalink award report block reply LostElf 3 points 7 hours ago Massive shift in women working outside the home.

Building 10 million homes would be a herculean undertaking in this economy and the whole reason that 50 year mortgage retardation is being pushed because folks can't afford the ones there are.
