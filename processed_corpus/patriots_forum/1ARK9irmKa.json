If a rich and famous couple can't get by without the white female getting a few holes added to her body, then what chance do the rest of them have? permalink award report block reply MediaBro 6 points 2 days ago It's often forgotten today just how much OJ was loved by White America, prior to him murdering that woman. He was a great football player, he married a pretty blonde, he was starring as the comic fodder in the Naked Gun movies and was even being chosen to star as the lead in a movie called The Terminator but was not chosen cos he seemed too nice a guy to be able to pull off that role. This man had it all. But a cheating wife is still a cheating wife. Had he just divorced her, told everyone she cheated on him and walked away and married another White woman or even stayed single and decided to bang women of all colours for the rest of his life, no one would even be mad at the guy for making those choices. But he couldn't even do that. It had to end in murder, sadly. What a waste. permalink parent award report block reply GTHAYS 2 points 1 day ago Tiger WOODS is just standing there smiling..... permalink parent award report block reply MediaBro 2 points 23 hours ago Pretty much.

I think his son did it and OJ covered for him. There is a FUCK ton of evidence that the police basically ignored because they never considered anyone else was the perp. but there is a lot of evidence pointing to his son.
