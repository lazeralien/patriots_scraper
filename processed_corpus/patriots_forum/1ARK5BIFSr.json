Who all? AI: President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping pardon on November 10, 2025, for 77 individuals, including Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Boris Epshteyn, and Kenneth Chesebro, for their roles in efforts related to the 2020 election. The pardons are described as \"full, complete, and unconditional\" and cover actions tied to advising, creating, organizing, or advocating for alternate slates of presidential electors, as well as efforts to expose alleged voting fraud. Rudy Giuliani, former personal lawyer to Trump, was pardoned for his role in pressuring state legislatures to reject Joe Biden\u2019s victories in key swing states. Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, was pardoned for being a key intermediary between Trump and state officials during the 2020 election period. John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, attorneys who helped devise a strategy to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election on January 6, 2021, were among those pardoned. Sidney Powell, a conservative attorney who launched a legal challenge on election fraud claims, received a pardon.\nBoris Epshteyn, a longtime Trump adviser, was also pardoned. The pardon also includes 72 others, such as state GOP chairs and activists involved in the \"fake elector\" scheme, including David Shafer (Georgia), Kelli Ward (Arizona), Michael McDonald (Nevada), and James Troupos (Wisconsin). permalink award report block reply flp999 -4 points 3 days ago muh tina peters tho... where my tina? permalink award report block reply ADAM_SCHITT 5 points 3 days ago He can't pardon state crimes permalink parent award report block reply\nAgnesDomini 11 points 3 days ago No Tina Peters yet? permalink award report block reply Tacitus1963 18 points 3 days ago He doesn't have the power to release Tina Peters because she has been jailed as part of a state crime which we know was never a crime.
