The Nineteenth Amendment is a scourge. permalink award report block reply cereal_killer 33 points 6 days ago I'd argue that the deathblow was actually \"fertility\" tech. American women got the vote and then remained more or less hardline for 40 years. It wasn't until the mass introduction of cheap, reliable, and readily accessible birth control that they truly went off the rails.

They don't care if society collapses as long as their babies die in it too.  Horrific. permalink parent award report block reply terribletwos 8 points 6 days ago Every problem can be traced back to birth control and abortions. All of our other problems are symptoms. permalink parent award report block reply dr_gonzo 9 points 6 days ago That's not so. The Federal Reserve is one of our biggest problems, yet it was imposed long before abortions became legal or birth control existed. Ditto the progressive income tax, Social Security, the Administrative Procedure Act that created our regulatory state and many other problems. Those things are the foundation. Abortion and birth control are the symptoms. Our side really needs to come to the realization that 90% of politics is ECONOMICS. The economic policies create the social problems, not the other way around. That's why Lenin himself said 90% of communizing a country was the establishment of a central bank.

You get the ability for women to be whores without responsibility in the 60s that leads to the major decline in Christianity. Top that off with the civil war creating a weak generation that travels throughout the century and you silent generation before the boomers and gen x after. So you get an entire generation whose defining character is free love and anti-Christian and due to their size versus the other generations, they become the defacto reality for the US for 60+ years. permalink parent award report block reply Floppybutthole 2 points 6 days ago This may be true.

It's the same anywhere in the world. Justin Trudeau got into power precisely because he was 'handsome' and received plenty of female Canuck votes based solely on that. permalink award report block reply ItsUsvstheelite 1 points 6 days ago Whats crazy is these globohomo dems destroying the country for power will eventually be overthrown by the same people they're using to keep them in power. permalink award report block reply AmericanJawa 1 points 6 days ago Moreso than the 17th? permalink award report block reply fasterthanspeedofdum 0 points 6 days ago The USA would be better off dialing it back to just the Bill of Rights. permalink parent award report block reply GreyKnight 0 points 6 days ago Modern politics of pandering and buying votes is all pretty bad, but women are narcissistically self destructive with Stockholm\u2019s Syndrome\u2026 permalink award report block reply Tacitus1963 0 points 6 days ago As well as the 19th being a scourge, so also in the unabated illegal alien flood into our country.\nThe rot started when Ted Kennedy et al got the Hart-Cellar Act passed in 1965 which opened the US to non-whites.\nA majority of the illegal hordes and minorities in general vote for the Demtards who offer free stuff. Many of these people despise our country and white population.\nThe Demtards would not have opened the border for 4 years nor have championed illegals if they did not support them come election time.\nWe have illegals voting in blue states. However, many of those who are minorities and are legally here, vote blue as well.\nThe bottom line is that we now have generations of people living here who do not share our values, culture, history, etc.\nThe only way we can try to stop the rot is by deporting most of the illegals. Erik Prince had a plan he presented to Trump to take care of the problem for $25 Billion. I wish our president had considered it.\nWe need to stop giving federal monies to all the Demtard states which are not following federal law re ICE, illegal alien criminals, etc.\nWe need a moratorium on all immigration for at least 10 years.\nNo more H-1 Bs. We don't need the Indian sub-continent moving here. Other than Dinesh D'Souza, most of the Indians are Demtards. permalink award report block reply chargebeck23 -7 points 6 days ago The party that wanted to be all about white christian men has suddenly discovered that there aren't enough white christian men to vote for them.
