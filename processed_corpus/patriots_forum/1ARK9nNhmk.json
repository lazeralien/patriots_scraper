Yes we have many talented people but in certain areas, we don't have enough people with very specific talent. Probably AI, energy, medical is what he's thinking. For example, back in the 90's when the internet was being built out, we didn't have enough Americans to scale things like BGP and OC-192 and OC-768. Without H1-B's, companies like Cisco never would have been able to scale and survive. Having said that, did the H1-B process get watered down to the point of hiring generic computer science grads? Yes it did and so we need to get back to focusing only on highly skilled specialized talent and the rest can go build Wakanda 2.0 somewhere else permalink award report block reply GatoradeJeb 1 points 2 hours ago Fuck off. Those are jobs americans want to do. But compabies refuse to hire White man due to dei and h1b. permalink parent award report block reply Bball-gurl 3 points 7 hours ago Wtf I love H1B's now?!? permalink award report block reply StoneRealist 2 points 7 hours ago I think this is both true and untrue. America does have talented people but they've been disenfranchised for so long they've had no choice but to move on to other career paths. All you're left with is college educated liberals that expect everything to be given to them and for their worldview to be coddled. So the available workers now for such jobs these h1b invaders get is largely comprised of the latter, which companies obviously don't want to entertain anymore permalink award report block reply GatoradeJeb 1 points 2 hours ago More like h1b is mainly dei and hatred of White man permalink parent award report block reply roflcopt0rz_returns 2 points 4 hours ago This is the end of Trump.
