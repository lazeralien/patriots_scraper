We have them in the us, we just don't mine them. Solution seems to be... mine them permalink parent award report block reply breadbaker 37 points 6 days ago We have them in the us, we just don't mine them. You have to be willing to destroy vast stretches of land to leach and refine a small amount. Much smarter to invest in a material resources recovery methods to avoid landfilling rare earths. Something that we could aim for when we would not be entertaining Zelensky and Netanyahu for the 10th time this year. permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 11 points 6 days ago TMSRs Very obvious for the last 15 years. Thorium Molten Salts Reactors Thorium is almost always tied to a cheap rare earth mineral monazite. There is other types of rare-earths connected, but monazite is the most commonly found with Thorium. There is literally a very simple and effective solution that nobody wants to implement except people that actually understand this. I support TMSRs for energy mainly, but there is a vast amount of subsets to this than just energy. Just the Cheap Rare earth mineral Monazite is just one part of the discussion. The fact that our own Government has done its best to kill any research into it while selling everything they have on it to China should say a lot about the situation. permalink parent award report block reply breadbaker 4 points 6 days ago I thought that ran its course and the last one (in AZ?) closed. 1+ billion write off.

Rare earths are technically not rare, but you have to mine like 3 football fields for 1 jar of the mineral. It's an incredibly dirty and intensive process to get the minerals in pure form. That's why we let China do it. I've heard we are 10+ years out from having a stable domestic supply. permalink parent award report block reply anotherrandomname 5 points 6 days ago We are trying to but we just assumed the supply from China was safe and so we never invested in the industry. No, we used to have an industry, what happened was China was dumping them cheap as fuck and undercutting what was possible for US mines and drove them out of business, and now that they've created a monopoly they're jacking prices up and using them for geopolitical purposes, which was, obviously, the plan all along, and makes a strong case for tariffs to protect local industry from such foreign dumping and monopolization. permalink parent award report block reply ifyoustrikemedown 4 points 6 days ago China was dumping, but the US rare earth industry never really took off. China took over as rare earth's started to be used in more and more technology. We didn't prioritize domestic production because we didn't realize their strategic importance and Washington DC is a lumbering dinosaur. Here's one source I came across: https://chinapower.csis.org/china-rare-earths/ In recent years, the US has sought to reestablish itself as a major world supplier of rare earths. After being shuttered for years, the US\u2019 only rare earth mine, located in Mountain Pass, California, came under new ownership in 2017 and resumed production. However, the mined material that it produces is still sent to China for processing. The US government has also made notable policy changes, including the May 2018 addition of rare earths to a list of minerals deemed critical to US economic and national security. In July 2019, President Trump also declared rare earth metals and alloys \u201cessential to the national defense,\u201d which freed up resources for the Department of Defense (DoD) to take action to secure a domestic rare earth production capability. If you look at the first chart, rare earth production began to skyrocket in the 90s. Our capacity never grew with demand. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... RedStoneDeepState 1 points 6 days ago No, the entire global industry is still only worth about 4 billion and most of the demand remains in Asian markets. I swear China is trying to get Trump to do stupid trade deals. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 0 points 6 days ago but you have to mine like 3 football fields for 1 jar of the mineral. Incorrect, the ore concentration of our one mine in Arizona is on average about 6%. It is just a bitch to separate lanthanides. That is it. permalink parent award report block reply ifyoustrikemedown 2 points 6 days ago I was just trying to make the point that the refinement is the issue, not the mining. I think it varies from mineral to mineral and from mine to mine. 6% is probably high for rare earths. permalink parent award report block reply TerryBibble 3 points 6 days ago Rare in this case is state rather than scarcity permalink parent award report block reply PitfallHarry 2 points 6 days ago What happened to drill baby drill? permalink parent award report block reply phro 1 points 5 days ago Are you not paying attention?

That\u2019s why deepseek was so disruptive. permalink parent award report block reply carpetxparmesan 2 points 5 days ago That other guy was a bit too mean, but I was going to post a youtube video on why and how this \"chip investment\" has been a failure just a few weeks ago. I'm not going to insult you personally, it's not about that, but I am getting pretty tired of normies on this site talking about the chips thing without actually knowing details about what's going on with the chips; not YOU personally. To summarize the problem, I'm going to relay an anecdote. Allegedly, the taiwanese JUMPED on this Trump opportunity and wanted to take advantage of it. So they TRIED. And, this is not my word, or my spin, this is how they presented it... they could not even get CLEAN ENOUGH WATER for their yields. As they presented (spin or not), they said they found out that the supply chain here does not even come close to what taiwan has set up over there. They imply, at a minimum, that supply chain problem would need to be fixed. Meaning, and these are my words now, it would take another 3-4 years before the supply chain could yield results and here's the BIG kicker... few people are even trying to work on supply chain issues. My interpretation of all this is the chip program is in big trouble here in the USA and it'll be ripe to be called a failure whenever democrats gain the least bit of power. I don't think it's a complete failure, but there's a lot more to be talked about on the issue. We might want to talk to the mods about doing a series of posts on the issue, maybe get some AMA from someone actually in the trenches in the admin or something. I think there's a lot to be unpacked (good and bad). But it's such a small part of the \"program\" right now and things are moving at such breakneck speed... it might be pointless just to inform people. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

You mean the Mongols.  The Mongols invaded and destroyed the Khwarazmians who ruled what is now Uzbekistan at the time (13th century).  Timur/Tamerlane founded the Timurid dynasty in the area (14th, and his descendent Babur founded the Mughal dynasty in India.  \"Mughal\" = \"Mongol\". permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 6 days ago I mean Uzbekistan not the Mongols. Tamerlane is the national hero of Uzbekistan, being born in Transoxiana as a Muslim. That is Uzbekistan. The capitol of his empire was Samarkand, again Uzbekistan. He claimed legitimacy from the Mongols but at the end of the day he was a Muslim not a Tengrist, it was squarely a different culture than Mongols. Hence why they get called Mughals, the Perzianization of Mongol. Babur was from Andijan - again Uzbekistan. permalink parent award report block reply Yawnz13 0 points 6 days ago I mean Uzbekistan not the Mongols You're still wrong though. Tamerlane is the national hero of Uzbekistan, being born in Transoxiana as a Muslim. That is Uzbekistan. The capitol of his empire was Samarkand, again Uzbekistan. Cool story, and who was he born of?  Turkified Mongols.  Transoxiana was at the time part of the Mongol confederation known as Barlas.  He shared common ancestry with Genghis Khan on his father's side, saw himself as Genghis' legitimate heir, and wanted to restore the Mongol Empire. He claimed legitimacy from the Mongols but at the end of the day he was a Muslim not a Tengrist, it was squarely a different culture than Mongols. You do understand that large portions of the Mongols converted to Islam, yes?  Being a Mongol and being a Muslim are not mutually exclusive concepts.  Timur claimed common ancestry with Genghis Khan, said ancestor being Tumbinai Khan. Had the Mongol invasion and subsequent destruction of the Khwarazmian Empire not happened, Timur wouldn't have been born.  Had Timur not been born, Babur wouldn't have been born.  Had Babur not been born, the Mughal Empire would never have been founded. permalink parent award report block reply view 9 more comments... lefty295 1 points 6 days ago Yeah but Uzbeks are the descendants of Timur or the people his ancestors brought partly. Timur was the result of a migration to that region by Mongolians. After they depopulated it. then mixed with the remaining locals and Turkic tribes into what are now Uzbeks. They're more similar to Timur than modern Mongolians are. Modern Uzbeks would have more of a claim to him as part of their national identity than a modern Mongolian would. Timur was born in modern day Uzbekistan. It doesn't matter who his ancestors are when he is their ancestor. Modern Mongolians are not his descendants.

They're the people that stayed in that region. Retarded argument.  Someone is German because their ancestors were German, yes?  German is a definable genetic group not dependent on place.  Likewise, so is \"Mongol\". Modern Uzbeks are a mix of Mongol and Turkic.

China took over as rare earth's started to be used in more and more technology. We didn't prioritize domestic production because we didn't realize their strategic importance and Washington DC is a lumbering dinosaur. Here's one source I came across: https://chinapower.csis.org/china-rare-earths/ In recent years, the US has sought to reestablish itself as a major world supplier of rare earths. After being shuttered for years, the US\u2019 only rare earth mine, located in Mountain Pass, California, came under new ownership in 2017 and resumed production. However, the mined material that it produces is still sent to China for processing. The US government has also made notable policy changes, including the May 2018 addition of rare earths to a list of minerals deemed critical to US economic and national security. In July 2019, President Trump also declared rare earth metals and alloys \u201cessential to the national defense,\u201d which freed up resources for the Department of Defense (DoD) to take action to secure a domestic rare earth production capability.

No, we used to have an industry, what happened was China was dumping them cheap as fuck and undercutting what was possible for US mines and drove them out of business, and now that they've created a monopoly they're jacking prices up and using them for geopolitical purposes, which was, obviously, the plan all along, and makes a strong case for tariffs to protect local industry from such foreign dumping and monopolization. permalink parent award report block reply ifyoustrikemedown 4 points 6 days ago China was dumping, but the US rare earth industry never really took off. China took over as rare earth's started to be used in more and more technology. We didn't prioritize domestic production because we didn't realize their strategic importance and Washington DC is a lumbering dinosaur. Here's one source I came across: https://chinapower.csis.org/china-rare-earths/ In recent years, the US has sought to reestablish itself as a major world supplier of rare earths. After being shuttered for years, the US\u2019 only rare earth mine, located in Mountain Pass, California, came under new ownership in 2017 and resumed production. However, the mined material that it produces is still sent to China for processing. The US government has also made notable policy changes, including the May 2018 addition of rare earths to a list of minerals deemed critical to US economic and national security. In July 2019, President Trump also declared rare earth metals and alloys \u201cessential to the national defense,\u201d which freed up resources for the Department of Defense (DoD) to take action to secure a domestic rare earth production capability. If you look at the first chart, rare earth production began to skyrocket in the 90s. Our capacity never grew with demand. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... RedStoneDeepState 1 points 6 days ago No, the entire global industry is still only worth about 4 billion and most of the demand remains in Asian markets.
