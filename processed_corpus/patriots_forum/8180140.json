If you asked a J who they would rather see extinguished off the face of the earth, Christians or Muslims, they choose Christians. permalink award report block reply Made_in_America 38 points 2 days ago Higher IQs = bigger threat to their global ambitions. They want a world where they can rule unchallenged. Given how sociopathic and genocidal they are as a group, it would be no exaggeration to describe a world ruled by Js as \u2018Hell on earth\u2019. permalink parent award report block reply BerettaStroker 18 points 2 days ago It actually goes back to a frothing, seething hatred of the Catholic church \"stealing\" their relics during the Crusades. permalink parent award report block reply Made_in_America 15 points 2 days ago Interesting. Regardless of where it started, for that resentment to carry over millennia, it\u2019s locked into their genes at this point. It\u2019s not a conflict that can be resolved politically. They are hard-wired to destroy us. I suspect that their anti-social tendencies were compounded by the fact that over the millennia their kindest people would have converted to the altruistic appeal of Christianity, leaving behind a growing genetic propensity for bitterness, selfishness and malice as the best tempered peopled left their gene pool to follow Christ. permalink parent award report block reply Viewer01 9 points 2 days ago At this point I support violent reconquest of the holy land just to put an end to this third temple business. permalink parent award report block reply lurkwellmyfriends 5 points 2 days ago I agree with the tone of this theead, but I have quite an issue with the Catholic church, too.

The Roman catholic group was infiltrated by them a long time ago. To the point they created their new \"zion\" through their physical \"church\" making it a political kingdom. They have had blood fueds with them since Jesus time. And even 800 years before that when the civil war happened and the Israelites rejected the Judeans and became separate kingdoms permalink parent award report block reply PelosisPuss -19 points 2 days ago Not even close.

You can see what id happening in real time. Ukraine has been provoking Russia and murdering Russians for the last 10 years. People are deliberately ignoring this, as well as the fact that Zelensky has suspended elections, outlawed political opposition, attacked the church, and stole billions of dollars.

Russia isn't communist anymore. It's a capitalist society. Why are you repeating cold war idiocy like the MSM? The soviets are gone. \"muh communism\" America is more socialist than modern Russia. Look at the 2000+ government agencies. SNAP ect. all communism. American corporatism is worse than the soviets ever where. Nearly every single problem this country faces is because of a government control, and regulations and authority. permalink parent award report block reply IAmTheScience -12 points 2 days ago No. There is nothing good about Russia. Not now or in the past. Read a history book. Putin and his friends have raped Russia and stolen anything it had of value for themselves. The people have very little chance to succeed and prosper. Human Rights are a joke to them. Two countries can both be bad. For example, in WW2 both Germany and Russia were bad. permalink parent award report block reply SenorTrumper 9 points 2 days ago Thanks for demonstrating how simpleton's think. permalink parent award report block reply Prussian_Pepe 1 points 2 days ago It's like I turned on the MSM, and heard boomer bob tell me about how \"muh russia\" is the bad. permalink parent award report block reply Prof_Smith 1 points 2 days ago Haha.

When he convinced Trump to shutdown during Covid?  When he brought that obvious fed plant Fuentes on his show to promote him?  He is a fraud. permalink award report block reply flp999 -4 points 2 days ago Better and more important question: how come no one in Congress, and not Tucker Carlson either, will acknowledge that it\u2019s the U.S., particularly the CIA, that run Ukraine and set every policy in the country? It\u2019s not an anti-Christian thing. It\u2019s an anti all religion thing. It\u2019s the same classic New Man/New Society scheme that\u2019s been run in every totalitarian play since the beginning of the 20th Century. Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Polpotism, etc. Tucker is such an agenda tool with his little misdirection bullshit.

If every topic you think is important comes up as \u201cI care about this but no one else does because it isn\u2019t Israel\u201d then you\u2019re contributing to the environment where everything is about Israel. permalink parent award report block reply\nGayguy420 0 points 2 days ago This really goes both ways.  They\u2019re two different issues.  Stop connecting everything to Israel so that other topics have room to breathe.

Remember when he was best friends with Hunter?  When he weirdly said something got mailed to him and disappeared?  When he didn't report on the laptop or election fraud?  When he convinced Trump to shutdown during Covid?  When he brought that obvious fed plant Fuentes on his show to promote him?  He is a fraud. permalink award report block reply\nflp999 -4 points 2 days ago Better and more important question: how come no one in Congress, and not Tucker Carlson either, will acknowledge that it\u2019s the U.S., particularly the CIA, that run Ukraine and set every policy in the country? It\u2019s not an anti-Christian thing. It\u2019s an anti all religion thing. It\u2019s the same classic New Man/New Society scheme that\u2019s been run in every totalitarian play since the beginning of the 20th Century. Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Polpotism, etc. Tucker is such an agenda tool with his little misdirection bullshit. Child of the CIA, child of the financial overlords that run the deal and reside in his beloved Socialist country Sweden. permalink award report block reply\nNoticesBugleOWO -7 points 2 days ago Absolute retardation.
