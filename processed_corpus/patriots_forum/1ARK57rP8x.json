Yes, we've all heard the \"they have it anyway\" line, but there is a difference between the government illegally having it and legally having it. permalink parent award report block reply POTUS_DonnieJ 6 points 4 days ago This is it, they need to know if you\u2019re under 15 so they can ban you from the internet. That also means they need to know if you\u2019re over 15.

Now they gather their global retard club together and it makes it seem like their voice is larger than it really is.

I told them that they could have one, but that they'd have to purchase it themselves.  I also told them that if they wanted to play sports, or any school activities, that of course I would support them and purchase what was needed.  But, they had to maintain a B average in order to participate.  The schools minimum was a C average.  Each one of them graduated with at least a 3.5 GPA.  I don't regret my decision one bit. permalink parent award report block reply Tobin 1 points 4 days ago This is the way, but unfortunately many parents nowadays don't hold their children to any standards and then blame the school.

We have a national digital ID. So the way it's gonna work is that if the social media does not implement it at login, it will likely get banned. Hopefully, this is the stepping stone to also ban all porn for under-18-year-olds, with the same logic. Implement digital ID or get banned by all IPS.

Reddit and all the generations together online were never going to see eye-to-eye.  Age 15-25  should have a special check mark online so we know they are minors and college age.  There's a reason you can't run for office of the president until 35 and that is because of experience in God, Family & Country.  It should actually be higher now that people are not getting married until their thirties, it's not 1776.
