No need. Understand American law and stop being afraid of shadows. No American can diminish or breach another American's private or public estates. permalink award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 2 days ago This is so retarded. You can't outlaw a religion. Sure, you can rationalize that it's not a religion, but you're never going to make a legal case on that. We need to end all refugee and asylum visas. We need to end uncapped family and dependent visas. By law, we have a 25,000 immigrant cap per nation. We need to amend the statute to make that cap apply to dependents as well. This is how the undesirable immigration grows so rapidly. For every one person legally admitted to seek their green card, they are able to import a dozen relatives who do not count against the statutory cap. permalink award report block reply Beardholder OP 2 points 2 days ago Its not a religion that is allowed by the constitution.\nAnd it was outlawed before. Any ideology that out right fights the constitution and seeks it's destruction is categorized as a Foreign and Domestic threat to the nation. Period. Don't be fooled. permalink parent award report block reply Repentnow 1 points 2 days ago Please quote the line in the Constitution that forbids Islam.

While the Constitution's text does not contain this exact sentence, the ** treason clause in Article III** defines treason as levying war against the U.S. or \"adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort,\" which encompasses both domestic and foreign threats, permalink parent award report block reply Inukshuk 1 points 2 days ago Their marketing plan uses this tag line \u201cYou can fit many goats and sheep in a Meadow, inshallah.\u201d permalink award report block reply RudeFrog 0 points 2 days ago If your constitution allows this, and it most certainly does, then of what use is your constitution? permalink award report block reply ApplyingForce 1 points 2 days ago If it allows what? permalink parent award report block reply HoganT -4 points 2 days ago So much for being constitutionalists, I guess.
