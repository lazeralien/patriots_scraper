I'm getting really fatigued by it.  It's NEVER a white family, it's always either blacks, a middle-eastern \"refugee,\" or a coal-burner with half-caste kids.  And something I've noticed- the kids never have beds, but they ALWAYS HAVE MULTIPLE LARGE-SCREEN TVS.  Every.  Fucking.  Time.  Bigger TVs than the single TV my wife and I have.  And I'm building beds for these fuckers.  I try to live a life in line with a Christian charitable mindset, but it's really, REALLY hard when those I'm giving to have more than I do. This is part of the reason I'm so fucking angry about everyone who gets any kind of gibs.  I work my ass off to afford the few luxuries I allow myself, and I see how high-on-the-hog those my taxes go to live.  I am so fatigued. permalink parent award report block reply desertflower 3 points 1 day ago Back in the 70s, our church youth group raised boxes of food for a local family at Christmas.

One of the places we delivered was a Section 8 apartment complex. The first time I saw a big screen plasma TV outside of the Sears' showroom was in that apartment complex, and more than one of those apartments had them. They had leather wrap around couches and other crazy things. The cars in the parking lot were also fairly new and there were absolutely no compact cars. Also, you could smell weed in the parking lot before you even got to the buildings. permalink parent award report block reply mohel 5 points 2 days ago Finally 7-11 stores will be able to restock their inventory. permalink parent award report block reply snoopy3210 4 points 2 days ago So much sugar it cannot be called food permalink parent award report block reply knnbccb 6 points 2 days ago They need the food stamps to get a new hairdo, and to paint their  nails at a salon. permalink award report block reply OutlawPurpleHairDye 3 points 2 days ago Standard EBT exchange rate is 40 cents on the dollar to get your nails did. permalink parent award report block reply anotherthing 1 points 1 day ago Fifty cents on the dollar was what I always heard.
