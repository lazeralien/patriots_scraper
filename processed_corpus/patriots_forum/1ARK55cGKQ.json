Everybody in the loop wants a huge payday for their service. permalink parent award report block reply terribletwos 7 points 5 days ago Bureaucracy is wild because it assumes itself and once you get like a Frank Fontaine, you get entrenched bureaucracy that's harder to destroy than almost any other form of corruption. Even if you get rid of the villain, the system itself is corrupted forever. It's one of the tools the progressives used to take over every position of power. Even with an improvement loop, you'd only get improved corruption. permalink parent award report block reply Crlsniper 15 points 5 days ago It\u2019s why monopolies are terrible regardless of corporate or governmental monopoly. They can become very authoritarian and inefficient. permalink award report block reply possibletower 2 points 5 days ago I highly doubt SpaceX would recover from fatal space disasters like Apollo and the Space Shuttle did. That is the silver lining about government-owned operations for large projects like space-related ones. And Starship still has failed to achieve one single orbit despite it supposed to land astronauts on the Moon on Artemis III. NASA's SLS, which uses recycled and proven Space Shuttle rockets and other parts, meanwhile has already launched Artemis I and will launch Artemis II next year. Musk is not serious about Moon exploration. Mars is a fucking retarded idea right now due to the extreme radiation on Mars and while in transit in space between Earth and Mars. The Moon OTOH is shielded from radiatoin 50% of every month thanks to the Earth's magnetosphere protecting the Moon when the Moon is behind Earth and Earth stands between the Sun and the Moon. permalink parent award report block reply AVeryNakedMan 5 points 5 days ago SpaceX has had many rockets blow up.

It boils down to \"we can hire a legislator, but we can't fire them once they're in\" We need strict term limits on congress We need all electronic voting machines to be mothballed and go to paper only.  Electronic voting can work but only with OPEN SOURCE and 3rd party security audited; blockchain is a good example since if people are using it for money then you can use it safely for vote.  The key thing is you need to be able to verify your vote was 1) counted and 2) counted correctly and 3) yours was included in the total, because its on a chain of encryption autheticated transactions We need a way to FIRE congresspeople We also need a way to impeach judges at all levels We also need a way to fire any US employee other than the president (says specifically in const only congress can do that) We (the people) can achieve the above with a citizens national referendum, which would act as a 4th branch of government, that will bridge that 'broken feedback loop'. Citizens Federal level Referendum is permanent, not temporary and created by an amendment, so it sticks. It's like a 1-3% genpop quorum, so 3.5million people have to be present (in zoom) to vote on an issue.  >50% on referendum issues passes them.  So > 1.25M yea Citizens referendum can impeach any US employee, it strikes the word 'sole' (if any) power of impeachment reserved to congress and says reserved to legislative branch and citizens referendum, which has precendent over the legistlative branch in mutually-interested, conflicting matters.

We vote people out if they do a bad job, neew guys cleans house, the cycle repeats.

Business competition only works because the only the lucky ones who manage to break the code and get it right win. Corporatism, top-down - Government run planning doesn't work not only because they bypass the normal free-enterprise business algorithms. The free-enterprise business algorithm is that 100s of people have what they think is a good idea. They all try it. Almost all of them fail miserably. But occassionally one of them is right and makes a great business, one that serves the customers, employees and stock holders. It's the 100s of efforts that are invisible, but necessary for the one lucky winner to emerge helping everyone. The tricky part is what happens next. Once that winner has won, they'll be tempted to use their winnings to lock in their high position by lobbying the government for favorable rules. That's when everything gets screwed up again. Edison wasn't wrong when he said, in hisearly days, that he hadn't failed at making a light bulb. He's found 1,000 things that don't work. That's what free enterprise is all about. Trying and finding the thousand things that don't work until you finds the ones that do. But the next step can't be to lock the doors on those good things. Instead the next step is to allow another thousand things to be tried to find even better things. permalink award report block reply possibletower 0 points 5 days ago I highly doubt SpaceX would recover from fatal space disasters like Apollo and the Space Shuttle did.
