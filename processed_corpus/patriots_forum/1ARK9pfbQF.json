They are Redditors here to sow discord because the Democrat party is in shambles, so the next best thing is to make the other guy look bad. Often times the shills will blend in by making acceptable posts for awhile then start turning up the rhetoric. A common tell is referring to users on this site as \"you guys\" (slip-up indicating they don't consider themselves part of this community). Anyways, be very diligent about vetting posters and if you see people shitting on DJT (who saved us from a Kamala \"Presidency\") make sure to call them out.\n51 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Around the Web 5 Parasite Causing Foods You Should Stop Eating Right Now Paratoxil Truthisunpopular 21 points 7 hours ago Anyone that disagrees with trump that Americans are too stupid, lazy and incompetent to do any job in America, from farmhand to engineer is a shill.
