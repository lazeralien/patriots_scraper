If only from her district, she's from Utah's Third District and serves Salt Lake, Summit, and Tooele counties. List of 40 Third District Court Judges Articles of impeachment are being filed against Dianna Gibson, and her ruling is being appealed. Utah Governor Spencer Cox supports the legislation appealing the court's decision. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: I have opened a bill to file articles of impeachment against Judge Gibson for gross abuse of power, violating the separation of powers and failing to uphold her oath of office to the Utah Constitution. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: It\u2019s being appealed also. Utah Governor Spencer Cox: The Utah Constitution clearly states that it is the responsibility of the Legislature to divide the state into congressional districts. While I respect the Court\u2019s role in our system, no judge, and certainly no advocacy group, can usurp that constitutional authority. For this reason, I fully support the Legislature appealing the Court\u2019s decision. Utah Republicans have 61/75 House seats. Utah Republicans have 22/29 Senate seats. So couldn't Republicans just vote against the map? All 5 Justices in Utah's Supreme Court are Republican as well. permalink parent award report block reply RoboGerbil 28 points 6 hours ago It's never slowed the Dems down.

Judge Dianna M. Gibson was appointed to the Third District Court in October 2018 by Governor Gary R. Herbert. She took the bench in January 2019 and serves Salt Lake, Summit, and Tooele counties. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: I have opened a bill to file articles of impeachment against Judge Gibson for gross abuse of power, violating the separation of powers and failing to uphold her oath of office to the Utah Constitution. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: It\u2019s being appealed also. Utah Republicans have 61/75 House seats. Utah Republicans have 22/29 Senate seats. All 5 Justices in Utah's Supreme Court are Republican. In redistricting Republicans are up by +7, Democrats are by +5, possibly +6 if Gibson's ruling isn't reversed. Republicans +7 North Carolina +1 \u2705 Missouri +1 \u2705 Texas +5 \u2705 Democrats +5, possibly +6 California +5 \u2705 (Prop 50) Utah +1 (Not voted on, hopefully reversed) permalink award report block reply MikeTruk 48 points 6 hours ago Woman judge \ud83e\udd71 permalink parent award report block reply yeptheguy 9 points 6 hours ago Shocking. permalink parent award report block reply Lady_MaGa -5 points 5 hours ago Oh stop that bullsht.

But sincerely,  you need to stop being so offended that someone says women on this site. You're doing the thing - that caused most to start degrading women. Also, men don't get their fucking wads in a twist when calling out other men. permalink parent award report block reply Lady_MaGa -4 points 4 hours ago I'm doing \"the thing\" that causes men to degrade women? What? By pointing out that men do the same thing?  I guess you are saying when men do bad it is ok and not to be mentioned, but if a woman does a bad thing, it must be pointed out and make men hate women.  Such a slanted view of human beings.  And your comment about men not getting their fucking wads in a twist when calling out other men, eh hem, you know how many times I've seen on this site men calling other men faggots, losers, fucktards, idiots, etc etc?  Please check yourself. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... Moose_Antlers 2 points 3 hours ago Let's be honest about it, women are more likely to support the Left. Among the Left, it's the affluent, educated white women who are implementing and driving the push to socialism. They do it based on a moral imperative. Socialism frames the world with a new moral imperative: to create 'equal,' equity (everyone has the same amount) not equality (everyone has the same chance to succeed if they do the work). This is a moral imperative. This is critical because it allows justification of the use of power to force this goal to be achieved. You can steal from people who have stuff to give it to those who don't. You can enslave a skilled man and force him to provide \"equal\" services to those who want or need them. And you can ignore laws and corruptly wield power so long as it advances this goal of 'equal.' Women do this with a much higher propensity than men and with more zealotry because they believe in the moral component of this. So yes, male judges are part of the picture, but we're seeing a lot more of the worst activism out of female judges. It's the female judges letting black and brown criminals out of the prisons as fast as they can because they're creating 'equal' representation in the prisons. It doesn't matter if they're criminals, there are too many in the jails, you see? It's the same with these female judges trying to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a known MS-13 gangster and wifebeater, in the US. They take the side of the illegal alien out of sympathy and a drive to remake America with less white people in it. 'Equal,' you see? It's not a both-sides thing. It simply reflects the demographics of the Left in the West. Don't get unnecessarily defensive. permalink parent award report block reply DeltaSierra 1 points 5 hours ago Correct.  However, I would clarify that the loner losers and antifa types that infect this site aren\u2019t real men they are deranged boys.  This site is infected with these losers.  They can\u2019t have a normal relationship with a woman so they hate women.  These anti-female types are very similar to many of the men in the Muslim culture they hate on.  Very strange people. permalink parent award report block reply Iremembermypassword 5 points 5 hours ago Thank god you will help them become functional members of society and allies to our side and not shit on them for no reason.

If only from her district, she's from Utah's Third District and serves Salt Lake, Summit, and Tooele counties. List of 40 Third District Court Judges Articles of impeachment are being filed against Dianna Gibson, and her ruling is being appealed. Utah Governor Spencer Cox supports the legislation appealing the court's decision. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: I have opened a bill to file articles of impeachment against Judge Gibson for gross abuse of power, violating the separation of powers and failing to uphold her oath of office to the Utah Constitution. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: It\u2019s being appealed also. Utah Governor Spencer Cox: The Utah Constitution clearly states that it is the responsibility of the Legislature to divide the state into congressional districts. While I respect the Court\u2019s role in our system, no judge, and certainly no advocacy group, can usurp that constitutional authority. For this reason, I fully support the Legislature appealing the Court\u2019s decision. Utah Republicans have 61/75 House seats. Utah Republicans have 22/29 Senate seats. So couldn't Republicans just vote against the map? All 5 Justices in Utah's Supreme Court are Republican as well. permalink parent award report block reply RoboGerbil 28 points 6 hours ago It's never slowed the Dems down.

Judge Dianna M. Gibson was appointed to the Third District Court in October 2018 by Governor Gary R. Herbert. She took the bench in January 2019 and serves Salt Lake, Summit, and Tooele counties. Utah House of Representatives Matt MacPherson: I have opened a bill to file articles of impeachment against Judge Gibson for gross abuse of power, violating the separation of powers and failing to uphold her oath of office to the Utah Constitution.

Among the Left, it's the affluent, educated white women who are implementing and driving the push to socialism. They do it based on a moral imperative. Socialism frames the world with a new moral imperative: to create 'equal,' equity (everyone has the same amount) not equality (everyone has the same chance to succeed if they do the work). This is a moral imperative. This is critical because it allows justification of the use of power to force this goal to be achieved. You can steal from people who have stuff to give it to those who don't. You can enslave a skilled man and force him to provide \"equal\" services to those who want or need them. And you can ignore laws and corruptly wield power so long as it advances this goal of 'equal.' Women do this with a much higher propensity than men and with more zealotry because they believe in the moral component of this. So yes, male judges are part of the picture, but we're seeing a lot more of the worst activism out of female judges. It's the female judges letting black and brown criminals out of the prisons as fast as they can because they're creating 'equal' representation in the prisons. It doesn't matter if they're criminals, there are too many in the jails, you see? It's the same with these female judges trying to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a known MS-13 gangster and wifebeater, in the US. They take the side of the illegal alien out of sympathy and a drive to remake America with less white people in it. 'Equal,' you see? It's not a both-sides thing. It simply reflects the demographics of the Left in the West. Don't get unnecessarily defensive. permalink parent award report block reply DeltaSierra 1 points 5 hours ago Correct.
