The parable Jesus told of the Good Samaritan was meant to teach this idea. You will not find this outlook in other religions or political systems. Virtually everywhere else, it is perfectly normal and expected to treat outsiders any way you like. You can cheat them, lie to them, steal from them, use them, buy them, sell them, and even kill them without consequence. As long as you treat your own immediate family well, and your own small tribe well, using outsiders is just the way life is. It's how you survive and, sometimes, grow rich. That's why it's completely normal and acceptable to people like this to take everything they can get from outsider, in any way they can. They honestly don't see anything wrong with it. But those in the West do not understand this. They think everybody is really just like we are and follows all the same rules. They don't. Not even close. Europe is already finding out And NYC is next. permalink award report block reply GoldenEarz 6 points 6 days ago In most cultures, taking advantage of others is celebrated.
