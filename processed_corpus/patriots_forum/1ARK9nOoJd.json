Oh wait if they could do that they would start their own coffee shop like the Asians do, and they would be required to make better coffee.

They've been doing it longer than anyone and I am sure it has only escalated in the last 6 years Anyone remember when the majority of people who worked at coffee shops, fast food spots, grocery stores were in there teens and early 20's? These aren't supposed to be supporting 30 and 40 year olds. permalink award report block reply rebuildingMyself 1 points 2 hours ago Yes it used to be one of the better places to work if you're in college.

I would be 90% of Starbuck's revenue comes from people that just want it made when they order it and they could give a shit about who's making it since they're going through a drive-through or ordering from a mobile app and just running into pick it up.

Add in the government fuckery and It's cheaper to make the financial investment to automate and get rid of employees. This is what happened here in Oregon with Kroger. permalink parent award report block reply\nutfanx2 1 points 16 minutes ago Meanwhile countertop espresso machines are getting cheaper, better, and more automated. Why wait in line for a $10 latte when you can push a button and have one in under a minute at home? permalink parent award report block reply JoePlumber 1 points 10 minutes ago i'm a black drip coffee kind of guy but yeah i've heard these are pretty good. as i understand it the key to fancy espresso machines is high pressure and if that can be achieved at home then who would pay $10? permalink parent award report block reply\nJoePlumber 1 points 10 minutes ago i'm a black drip coffee kind of guy but yeah i've heard these are pretty good. as i understand it the key to fancy espresso machines is high pressure and if that can be achieved at home then who would pay $10? permalink parent award report block reply\nthrowaway777b 6 points 4 hours ago You sip what you percolate permalink award report block reply\nUser25000 6 points 4 hours ago Starbucks fucked up with 20 years of DEI hiring. They've been doing it longer than anyone and I am sure it has only escalated in the last 6 years Anyone remember when the majority of people who worked at coffee shops, fast food spots, grocery stores were in there teens and early 20's? These aren't supposed to be supporting 30 and 40 year olds. permalink award report block reply rebuildingMyself 1 points 2 hours ago Yes it used to be one of the better places to work if you're in college. Flexible schedules, decent pay, cool benefits like free bag of coffee each week, etc. Unfortunately a lot of those college kids never thought two steps ahead so kept on working there even after graduation since nobody hires Karens with underwater basketweaving degrees. permalink parent award report block reply\nrebuildingMyself 1 points 2 hours ago Yes it used to be one of the better places to work if you're in college.
