Thousands of Ukrainians poured onto the streets to protest this move. The protests lasted several days. Ukraine's Parliament was forced to pass a new Bill that restored the independence of those two agencies, however, the Bill also required polygraphs for officers. Now this. It's obvious Zelensky and the Ukraine Parliament are colluding to hide the corruption that is taking place in the government. Every 90 days, the Ukraine Parliament extends martial law in the country, and Zelensky signs that extension. He's signed 17 martial law extensions so far. The longer the Parliament and Zelensky can keep this charade going, the people of Ukraine can't vote get rid of the shit their government is doing.
