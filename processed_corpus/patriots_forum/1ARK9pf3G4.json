Now he's \"minus 40\". If that's due-to a rogue FBI troll farm PsyOp-- they've done a magnificent job of buttfucking America. If that's not the explanation-- and Nick Fuentes is operating independently, according to his own agenda-- then he has done-so despite having every Trusted Institution\u2122 united against him. There's only one way that's possible:  if those opposed to Nick Fuentes left a giant hole in the political landscape, for him to seize, occupy, and expand to fill. Fuentes didn't invent that strategy. 2016 Trump saw the discrepancy between the positions that the Republican Party was willing to occupy/ vs. many many opinions held by the voters... with no leader willing to stand-up for what we actually wanted. Heck, even that retarded hipster Zohran Mamdani saw an opportunity-- when Every Other Candidate on the Dem primary debate stage-- said they would immediately fly to Israel after being elected, first thing.    And No Other Candidate was willing to acknowledge how insanely expensive it is for a young person to start a life in NYC.   (In Mamdani's case-- he was only able to offer brain-dead \"solutions\".  But the voters didn't-even care.  They settled for him as a Protest Vote.  With no obligation to deliver his Communist Promises.) The thing about any leader-- who shows us that a forbidden position Can be claimed & championed-- is that his leadership can't be Un-Done.   A bullet took Charlie Kirk, but he had already showed us the way forward. Only Zohran can negate Mamdani-- by failing to deliver.  Only Nick can cancel Fuentes-- by becoming that-which he formerly denounced.  Only Donald can derail the Trump train. permalink parent award report block reply possibletower -8 points 10 hours ago 100%. Fucking finally.

MAGA full steam! permalink award report block reply Necrovoter 4 points 10 hours ago The H1Bs were coming in before.  The new applications have a 100K fee.   This isn't any kind of acceleration of H1B. I'd agree that we need less H1Bs and more effort finding the Americans who are qualified, and more focus on training future Americans for the high H1B usage areas. Trump isn't backtracking.   \"Basket of Deplorables\" didn't work.  \"Garbage People\" didn't work.  \"MAGA is dead\" won't work. permalink parent award report block reply Wexit-Delecto 9 points 10 hours ago The fee should be on every renewal. Otherwise it still makes sense to hire. Jeet for $70k for 3 years than to hire a White, Christian American for $100k for the same time. As it is now, it\u2019s basically saying \u201cokay international megacorps that shouldn\u2019t exist if antitrust law were properly applied, you can replace the American workforce \u2026 but give the government a cut!\u201d permalink parent award report block reply Necrovoter 1 points 9 hours ago I've no arguments against any of that, or even more strict rules.  The prices need to start increasing on a schedule that allows time for new students to come through colleges to gain the so called \"talent\" that the companies need. e.g.   5 years from now  200K for first processing and 100K per year.  7 years  - 350K and 150K per year.  10 years 500K and 250K per year.  15 years and 1,000,000 with a 500K per year renewal. If they claim they have to move out of the country, tell them they can no longer ever sell any products or services in the United States, and if they were a US company at startup, they lose all their US physical assets and intellectual properties developed here. permalink parent award report block reply vegaspatriot1776 2 points 3 hours ago Are you referring to those 600,000 chinese students each year?

But everything Trump has pushed the last few days is America last. Tell me how 50 year mortgages help the housing crisis. Oh you save a few hundred bucks every month to pay massive interest to the banks. Tell me how speeding up naturalization process for H1Bs is helping America without saying anything about GDP go up. Explain to me how Trump flip flopping on deportations and all the news is literally a drop in the bucket. If deportations don't speed up, we're not even going to be able to remove the 10 million that Biden let in. We need to remove about 50 million. We need a moratorium on immigration. Please explain how this is gonna help the average American. Explain to me how Trump is saying that Americans lack talent. Pissing in your face and calling it rain. All of this is America last. Don't even get me started on the Epstein nonsense either. I voted for Trump and I was excited with the messaging. But after a year, I'm seeing we got the Temu version. Trump was the one who coined the term America first back during his first run. He said on his first inauguration \"From this day forward, it's only going to be America first.\" And so far I'm seeing the boomer version of maga, which was sell out your country for the highest profits. Simple as. permalink award report block reply GainesvilleFlorida 2 points 53 minutes ago Realistically. How could deportations happen faster?\nThe gov moves extremely slow (when folllowing the law). ICE cannot deport at the same rate they were illegally flown in. They aren\u2019t freaking lining up at the airport to leave like they did to come in. The Biden admin didn\u2019t have seemed forces in other countries rounding them up to bring here.\nI\u2019m surprised we even hit 3000 deportations a week. permalink parent award report block reply RizzlieDoodad 1 points 38 minutes ago This is a national emergency permalink parent award report block reply FaustyArchaeus 3 points 10 hours ago Magic fren pure magic permalink award report block reply kek-is-tan OP 3 points 10 hours ago TY fren permalink parent award report block reply projectarcturus 2 points 10 hours ago Ye olde talking points. permalink award report block reply GainesvilleFlorida 2 points 57 minutes ago I was having a good day until I saw this photo that always pisses me off. permalink award report block reply Maga305_47 2 points 1 hour ago \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 permalink award report block reply FreeKyleNow 2 points 2 hours ago Has anyone ever done a deep dive to identify these faggots? permalink award report block reply kekranger 1 points 10 hours ago Chinese bot accounts more likely. permalink award report block reply possibletower -6 points 10 hours ago Nick is 100% a Chinese bot account.

AF is inevitable as the next step in reclaiming our nation. permalink parent award report block reply\nDT170x 8 points 10 hours ago Glow OP = FAG OP. permalink award report block reply\nlifeisahologram 5 points 2 hours ago Pretty sure MAGA is supposed to be America first, but I will always side with whatever side doesn\u2019t support h1bs, doesn\u2019t believe America can\u2019t do certain jobs, doesn\u2019t give money to foreign \u201cAllies\u201d etc permalink award report block reply\nRobinNet 5 points 9 hours ago Faggots Being Idiots permalink award report block reply\nBidenSniffsLittleKid 4 points 10 hours ago Somewhere down the line America first turned into American corporations first and they\u2019re not wrong for pointing it out permalink award report block reply\nRob55 3 points 3 hours ago MAGA is not all about Trump. It\u2019s bigger. Yes created by Trump but if Trump goes full socialist tomorrow MAGA carries on without him. permalink award report block reply\nRizzlieDoodad 3 points 2 hours ago You can call em feds all you want. But everything Trump has pushed the last few days is America last. Tell me how 50 year mortgages help the housing crisis. Oh you save a few hundred bucks every month to pay massive interest to the banks. Tell me how speeding up naturalization process for H1Bs is helping America without saying anything about GDP go up. Explain to me how Trump flip flopping on deportations and all the news is literally a drop in the bucket. If deportations don't speed up, we're not even going to be able to remove the 10 million that Biden let in. We need to remove about 50 million. We need a moratorium on immigration. Please explain how this is gonna help the average American. Explain to me how Trump is saying that Americans lack talent. Pissing in your face and calling it rain. All of this is America last. Don't even get me started on the Epstein nonsense either. I voted for Trump and I was excited with the messaging. But after a year, I'm seeing we got the Temu version. Trump was the one who coined the term America first back during his first run. He said on his first inauguration \"From this day forward, it's only going to be America first.\" And so far I'm seeing the boomer version of maga, which was sell out your country for the highest profits. Simple as. permalink award report block reply GainesvilleFlorida 2 points 53 minutes ago Realistically. How could deportations happen faster?\nThe gov moves extremely slow (when folllowing the law). ICE cannot deport at the same rate they were illegally flown in. They aren\u2019t freaking lining up at the airport to leave like they did to come in. The Biden admin didn\u2019t have seemed forces in other countries rounding them up to bring here.\nI\u2019m surprised we even hit 3000 deportations a week. permalink parent award report block reply RizzlieDoodad 1 points 38 minutes ago This is a national emergency permalink parent award report block reply\nGainesvilleFlorida 2 points 53 minutes ago Realistically.
