Don't undersell that bullshit and give those commie fucks a win they didn't earn. They meant for every fucking one of us to die of the Covid vax, they meant for us to still be in masks today, they meant to put us resistors in camps. I fought the war in NJ, enemy territory and we got them to back down. They opened schools totally unwillingly, they gave up the mask mandate totally unwillingly and they abandoned the vax mandate totally unwillingly. Fuck that, I was giving Governor Goofy the finger at a rally in his front yard as the NJ State Police were telling us \"you have had enough First Amendment for the day\" proving they were nothing but pension whores. Fuck that, we won that fight. permalink parent award report block reply Appeal2Heaven98 -3 points 23 hours ago How you can spin the handling of the Covid pandemic as a win for us is beyond me. Congratulations. You avoided getting a vaccine and gave your governor the bird. Here's a gold star for participating in doing the absolute bare minimum. They did it as a test run to see how far they could go with taking away our rights. They shut down the world for months, if not years, and we let them do it. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

The left already has tried to assassinate Trump, succeeded with Kirk, and have outright cheered and voted on the New Democrat platform of \"vote for me and I will kill your political opponents.\" And what has the right collectively done in response?  Nothing but an internal civil war between MAGA and Establishment Neo-Con Inc. that has further fragmented the base into too many shards of the greater whole.

Nobody in this country should be afraid to go see anybody speak. I was there and it was pretty tense leaving. They funneled us all out to one spot and the mob was waiting for us screaming at us there. At least they had a line of riot police there, but it felt like things might get violent at any second. permalink award report block reply dissledat 3 points 2 days ago Here's some more details/video from the (very biased) Berkeleyside: https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/11/10/turning-point-usa-uc-berkeley-zellerbach-hall It is ironic that leftists at berkeley try so hard to silence the opposition, considering Berkeley's reputation as the birthplace of the Free Speech movement. I suspect that most of the protestors there are not actually Cal students, but local activists/antifa from nearby berkeley/oakland/sf. The leftist who got arrested in the video looked way too old to be a student. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 1 day ago It\u2019s as organic as the vegan prepared food they microwave. permalink parent award report block reply zerk0021 1 points 2 days ago Was it in Zellerbach? Were there any UC police, or only city police? Were city police in lower Sproul? permalink parent award report block reply RiffFantastic 2 points 2 days ago Yes it was in Zellerbach Hall. Rob was talking shit about the chancellor limiting tickets for the event so a lot of students couldn\u2019t get in. I think the venue was at capacity so maybe he was griping that they didn\u2019t put it in a bigger venue like Haas Pavilion. I think there were city police, UC Police and private security. The whole lower sproul was cordoned off. You could only get in if you had a ticket. I was able to slip in a quiet entrance to the plaza by Strawberry Creek. There I saw most of the police and protesters were on the Bancroft side of the plaza. There were also riot police staged in the MLK building. When I got out those riot police were the barrier between us and the protesters at the top of the stairs on upper sproul. permalink parent award report block reply zerk0021 1 points 2 days ago 'It boggles my mind  they  even care  TPUSA holds an event at Zellerbach.

At least they had a line of riot police there, but it felt like things might get violent at any second. permalink award report block reply dissledat 3 points 2 days ago Here's some more details/video from the (very biased) Berkeleyside: https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/11/10/turning-point-usa-uc-berkeley-zellerbach-hall It is ironic that leftists at berkeley try so hard to silence the opposition, considering Berkeley's reputation as the birthplace of the Free Speech movement. I suspect that most of the protestors there are not actually Cal students, but local activists/antifa from nearby berkeley/oakland/sf. The leftist who got arrested in the video looked way too old to be a student. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 1 day ago It\u2019s as organic as the vegan prepared food they microwave. permalink parent award report block reply zerk0021 1 points 2 days ago Was it in Zellerbach? Were there any UC police, or only city police? Were city police in lower Sproul? permalink parent award report block reply RiffFantastic 2 points 2 days ago Yes it was in Zellerbach Hall. Rob was talking shit about the chancellor limiting tickets for the event so a lot of students couldn\u2019t get in. I think the venue was at capacity so maybe he was griping that they didn\u2019t put it in a bigger venue like Haas Pavilion. I think there were city police, UC Police and private security. The whole lower sproul was cordoned off. You could only get in if you had a ticket. I was able to slip in a quiet entrance to the plaza by Strawberry Creek. There I saw most of the police and protesters were on the Bancroft side of the plaza. There were also riot police staged in the MLK building. When I got out those riot police were the barrier between us and the protesters at the top of the stairs on upper sproul. permalink parent award report block reply zerk0021 1 points 2 days ago 'It boggles my mind  they  even care  TPUSA holds an event at Zellerbach.

Erika Kirk needs to be all over this. If it turns out the Turning Point USA guy did not start throwing hands until he was taken to the ground, Erika need to go full throttle publicising this attack on their staff. if it turns out the Turning Point guy started any fighting, they need to disown him immediately. there is no in between. even the headline here on Patriots reports it as turning point employee in fight, not as a defensive. permalink award report block reply RiffFantastic 0 points 1 day ago Was he a TP employee?
