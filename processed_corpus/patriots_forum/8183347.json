In the past that half was practically normal White Americans and some blacks. That has been replaced by all the minorities, fags, illegals, feminists, trans, and dye-in-the-wool communists. permalink parent award report block reply Hunter77 2 points 22 hours ago There are still a ton of whites voting Dem too, especially in cities. Not just major cities, either. permalink parent award report block reply Hunter77 2 points 22 hours ago I know an awful lot of Dem voting whites. There are entire neighborhoods of such around here.

Get out of your bubble. permalink parent award report block reply Hunter77 1 points 16 hours ago 40% of whites - and I think it's more than that - is still a fucking large number. Allied with non-whites it's an even bigger number. I have yet to see a serious plan for dealing with half a country opposing us, not even accounting for all the RINO voters and MAGA people who condemn 2/3 of our options. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments...

SimaYi 2 points 19 hours ago It is extremely hard to believe that roughly HALF of voting Americans vote Democrat How is this hard to believe? Only half the country is White. Jews love to show you pictures of White women and say they are the Democrat power base. They aren't in the slightest. It's the literal millions of non-Whites who ONLY vote Democrat. This is why they open the borders. The Democrat Party is the Anti-White Party. When arguing with a White Leftist, it's always about economics or some bullshit. When arguing with a non-White, it's about race every time. You live in a multi-racial democracy, and all politics are identity politics. permalink parent award report block reply ForgottenUsername 1 points 22 hours ago It's actually not that concerning.   Young people always vote that way until they mature.  And the trend is changing where while they still mostly support the left the right is gaining support.  And because of birth rates there are far more older people than young people.  But that gets countered by boomers who don't have the Internet and still believe the MSM. permalink parent award report block reply WilliverTwo 1 points 20 hours ago I never went through a liberal phase as a kid let alone voting Democrat and I was born in 1990. And I grew up in the suburbs of Minneapolis in a single-mom household. I was a month shy of being 18 years old on election day 2008, but I think I would not have voted if it were held after my birthday or if I was born sooner to be 18 years old then. Even without internet access to show me alternative viewpoints, it was pretty obvious to me that Fox News was controlled-opposition \"conservativism\" even when I was a 16 year old kid in the Year 2007, again at the time I had very little to know access to like web forms or spending a lot of time with the internet at home it was mostly public library access. I didn't have many friends growing up and couldn't relate to most kids my age. permalink parent award report block reply HeavyMetalPatriot 1 points 23 hours ago Except the midterms are in grave danger. https://patriots.win/p/1ARK9l81LF/midterms-are-in-grave-danger-tim/c permalink parent award report block reply ForgottenUsername 2 points 22 hours ago Midterms always suck that's why I'm kind of disappointed Trump isn't going harder now while he has full control.  And Congress and his Supreme Court picks are pretty useless.  Every lower court attempting to instruct should be shot down by the supreme court immediately.  And shouldn't action be taken against these corrupt judges? permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 2 points 18 hours ago He's failed. He's a 1990s Bill Clinton Democrat at his core.

Keep on cancelling young folks and anyone critical of Israel and see where that gets us in \u201828. It\u2019s truly bizarre to watch them hate their grand kids this much and throw open the doors for anyone and everyone to come in and get priority. permalink award report block reply LokiHelmsdeep -10 points 24 hours ago Just STFU up already with the Jew shit, y'all faggots ass Nick Fuentes-type losers are nothing's and will never be anything.   Well, tbf some of yall will realize how retarded your worldview is and change, but either way you're Social Media click-rage \"Jews control everything\" nonsence is staright up garbage and has already been fading fast.

So, not going to happen. permalink parent award report block reply mikejones 2 points 18 hours ago I was just talking about that tonight at therapy. permalink parent award report block reply Tele_Plus 5 points 23 hours ago The battle against Islam will be a tough one I think because their strategy is to use our own system against us and take over entire cities legally.  It\u2019s insidious because they\u2019ve been doing it in the background for some time now.  How do we stop them?  I think there needs to be some serious restrictions on who can become a  citizen in this country, and who can take public office.  Like in Japan - you can\u2019t just move there.  You need a damn good reason to be there, otherwise after 90 days it\u2019s GTFO. permalink award report block reply mikejones 1 points 18 hours ago The long game is being played and every area is being taken advantage of. It's near impossible to fix cause there's so much dead weight draining the resources non-stop. permalink parent award report block reply LokiHelmsdeep 5 points 24 hours ago Would be nice to deport 50 or so million illegal immigrants and Leftist's, the stuff dreams are made of!!   Reasonably we could deport 20+ million illegal immigrants over the next few years and put 100,000 or so mentally deranged Leftists into Mental Institutions to get the mental healthcare they so desperately need. permalink award report block reply Ostia 2 points 24 hours ago We haven\u2019t even deported a million yet in over a year. permalink parent award report block reply LokiHelmsdeep -1 points 24 hours ago There have been over a half million deportations and over 2 million self deportations....hold on, let me grab my calculator......that equals well over 2.5 million illegal immigrants deported from America and in less than 10 months since Trump's Inaugurated and less than 9 months of having the teams in place to start deportations. permalink parent award report block reply covok48 4 points 22 hours ago ^ This guy is gearing up for his 50 year mortgage. permalink parent award report block reply Ostia 2 points 23 hours ago Neat grading curve you\u2019ve got there to want to try and count how many people we claim have left on their own. How do you think we calculate that? Do they ask if you\u2019re moving home at the Mexico border? Do you submit a letter to the government? Is there a database? Have we been presented any data to verify that? Nope. No. We have not. No there is not. permalink parent award report block reply SimaYi 1 points 18 hours ago Only 85 million to go. permalink parent award report block reply henri_derelicte 3 points 23 hours ago I have to agree with the latter. It won\u2019t be enough to simply stop the flow of third worlders. We have to send people back who are already here, including some of those who are already citizens permalink award report block reply I_Love_45-70_Gov 3 points 23 hours ago My immigration policy is pork.

We gave it to them like it was a formality so why not the other way round? permalink award report block reply dr_gonzo 2 points 20 hours ago From 1776 until 1965 our immigration was QUOTA BASED on a per country level, and it strongly favored Europeans. Very few were allowed from other countries. Then in 1965 Teddy Kennedy and the boys got rid of the quotas and made the priority \"re-uniting families\". Combine that with birthright citizenship and you've got an invitation for illegal immigration. And when you throw in the welfare state that was created that same year, we went from inviting the most industrious and adventurous Europeans that simply wanted a free society to prosper, to 3rd worlders that wanted to shit out kids for handouts. You know, sorta like exactly what happened? So why in the fuck isn't anyone suggesting we go back to the QUOTA BASED system that worked so wonderfully for 200 years? permalink award report block reply Oleander 1 points 19 hours ago It would be considered \"racially insensitive\" to prioritize Europeans again. I hate this world that the last few generations created. Common sense and wisdom completely gone, and we're left to deal with the consequences of third worlders, whores, niggrs, and general moral/trust decay everywhere. Fuck everyone who prioritized these out groups over their own people and their own children's futures and safety, all in the name of looking like a \"good person\" (bullshit). permalink parent award report block reply TooBright 2 points 23 hours ago Any black that wants reparations should receive repatriation immediately. If they can't respect the fortunate position they're in they should get that reality check immediately. permalink award report block reply MySidesGoUp 2 points 20 hours ago To \u201cwork\u201d for govt you should be Made in America.

You could get away with deporting all these foreigners 50 years ago, but the sad fact is that White Americans, ie. Americans (the proof is that I even have to say this), are now just another interest group in the American economic zone. In 10 years, you'll be a minority in your own country, and you'll watch the collapse of the United States in real time as the borders are opened to the entire world, and the treasury is emptied. You WILL see a President AOC. The fall of the West is coming. It is inevitable. permalink award report block reply mikejones 1 points 18 hours ago I do wonder how long it'll take. It'll be 2029 and 50 trillion in debt soon. How long can it go on for. The few deported might clean up the crime in the short term but it's just new territory for those who remain with more kids becoming criminals every year. Then technology will control your whole life. It'll be like living in China. permalink parent award report block reply Wolfebane84 1 points 20 hours ago My immigration policy is European decent only.  Everyone else, out. permalink award report block reply f_bastiat 1 points 19 hours ago My immigration policy is basically the same as Logan's with the stipulation that they are deported off a cliff and we send our entire arsenal of nukes to turn every Muslim majority country to glass so we don't have to worry about them coming here ever again. permalink award report block reply GuerillaYourDreams 1 points 23 hours ago OUT!!! permalink award report block reply Megaboom2025 1 points 19 hours ago Mine is to convict every politician for treason if they have taken money from AIPAC permalink award report block reply Helly -2 points 23 hours ago There\u2019s no immigration policy radical enough for you guys. It\u2019s getting a bit silly. I remember when it started like yeah let\u2019s deport the criminals now it\u2019s like oh let\u2019s just denaturalized everybody and send them home. Bunch of retards same behavior that Reddit does. permalink award report block reply henri_derelicte 5 points 22 hours ago I hate to speak in such a hyperbole, but the people that make implementing Trump\u2019s policies impossible are going to make the next Hitler inevitable. permalink parent award report block reply Oleander 1 points 19 hours ago nothing hyperbole about it if you ask me permalink parent award report block reply mikejones 1 points 18 hours ago Our own system being used against us when it's for something good.

Combine that with birthright citizenship and you've got an invitation for illegal immigration. And when you throw in the welfare state that was created that same year, we went from inviting the most industrious and adventurous Europeans that simply wanted a free society to prosper, to 3rd worlders that wanted to shit out kids for handouts.

If they can't respect the fortunate position they're in they should get that reality check immediately. permalink award report block reply\nMySidesGoUp 2 points 20 hours ago To \u201cwork\u201d for govt you should be Made in America.

You could get away with deporting all these foreigners 50 years ago, but the sad fact is that White Americans, ie. Americans (the proof is that I even have to say this), are now just another interest group in the American economic zone. In 10 years, you'll be a minority in your own country, and you'll watch the collapse of the United States in real time as the borders are opened to the entire world, and the treasury is emptied. You WILL see a President AOC. The fall of the West is coming. It is inevitable. permalink award report block reply mikejones 1 points 18 hours ago I do wonder how long it'll take. It'll be 2029 and 50 trillion in debt soon. How long can it go on for. The few deported might clean up the crime in the short term but it's just new territory for those who remain with more kids becoming criminals every year. Then technology will control your whole life. It'll be like living in China. permalink parent award report block reply\nmikejones 1 points 18 hours ago I do wonder how long it'll take.
