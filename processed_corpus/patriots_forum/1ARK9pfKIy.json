A plain IQ test would uplift unqualified people with high verbal intelligence who are lacking in math/logic and visual-spatial and possibly closer to average in these areas.

Ideas don\u2019t bleed, fight, build, or preserve anything on their own. A nation isn\u2019t a TED Talk it\u2019s a real people, with a real culture, a real history, a real lineage, and a real way of life that existed long before think-tanks started calling everything \u2018an idea. America didn\u2019t spring out of thin air because someone scribbled principles on parchment.\nThose principles came from the people who built it their traditions, their culture, their worldview, their identity. You don\u2019t get America by swapping out the entire population like a software update and saying, \"Don\u2019t worry guys, the idea is still here!\" Nations are built by the continuity of the people who formed them. Ideas guide a nation people make it exist. When you reduce a country to a floating ideology, you\u2019re basically saying anyone, anywhere, at any time can magically be the same nation just by repeating a slogan. That\u2019s not how nations work. That\u2019s how marketing campaigns work. Call it harsh, but it\u2019s reality:\nAmerica is not just a constitutional pamphlet.\nIt\u2019s a civilization and civilization comes from the people who created it, their shared memory, their culture, and their way of life carried forward through generations. You change the people, you change the nation.\nYou don\u2019t get to swap the entire demographic core and pretend nothing happened\nMy country is not just an idea it\u2019s a people. permalink award report block reply ClarenceBeeks 2 points 9 hours ago Really says it all right there permalink award report block reply barronwin 2 points 7 hours ago lmao build 10 million homes permalink award report block reply FusionBlack 2 points 2 hours ago Then they killed him for it. permalink award report block reply barwhack 1 points 2 hours ago And they killed him for saying it. permalink award report block reply SteveRogers42 1 points 20 minutes ago If we do 1, we won\u2019t need to do 5. permalink award report block reply AlmostFullyDilated 1 points 7 hours ago wise man don't stand in path of bullet -ancient chinese proverb permalink award report block reply conservativefrank 1 points 1 hour ago It isn't happening with Trump.

The only item on that list that makes any type of sense is point 6. permalink award report block reply Raekith 11 points 9 hours ago Illegals take space.  This means goods and services designed for citizens.  This includes housing.  Getting rid of them means opening up those goods and services for Americans. H1B Visas are being used to import cheap third world labor, often (always) for jobs Americans are willing and capable of doing.  The lie about finding the talent abroad is just that - a lie.  Every single H1B sent back home is another job available for an American. Immigrants, even legal ones, take space.  Same as point 1.  Lower the caps on legal immigration and you'll see a reduction in job competition.  Remember basic economics: If you have 10 people competing for 1 job, the job sets the salary.  If you have 1 person competing for 10 jobs, the person sets the salary.  Stop overwhelming the supply of labor, and you'll see an increase in demand from jobs. Compounding on problems 1 and 3.  Chain migration should never have been a thing, just like anchor babies.  Birth Tourism is a very real, and hugely problematic thing for our country.  I can't wait for it to end so we can stop having these 9-month pregnant illegal aliens undergoing potentially dangerous border crossings just to drop their baby before they rightly get deported, then immediately claim they need to stay to keep their family together (because obviously the American child of two illegal aliens needs to stay in America, for some inexplicable reason). permalink parent award report block reply 12345SIX 1 points 3 hours ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply EyesSewnShut 1 points 21 minutes ago Comment removed by community moderators. permalink award report block reply\nNecrovoter 45 points 9 hours ago Point # 6 is vastly underrated.

Ideas don\u2019t bleed, fight, build, or preserve anything on their own. A nation isn\u2019t a TED Talk it\u2019s a real people, with a real culture, a real history, a real lineage, and a real way of life that existed long before think-tanks started calling everything \u2018an idea. America didn\u2019t spring out of thin air because someone scribbled principles on parchment.\nThose principles came from the people who built it their traditions, their culture, their worldview, their identity. You don\u2019t get America by swapping out the entire population like a software update and saying, \"Don\u2019t worry guys, the idea is still here!\" Nations are built by the continuity of the people who formed them. Ideas guide a nation people make it exist. When you reduce a country to a floating ideology, you\u2019re basically saying anyone, anywhere, at any time can magically be the same nation just by repeating a slogan. That\u2019s not how nations work. That\u2019s how marketing campaigns work. Call it harsh, but it\u2019s reality:\nAmerica is not just a constitutional pamphlet.\nIt\u2019s a civilization and civilization comes from the people who created it, their shared memory, their culture, and their way of life carried forward through generations. You change the people, you change the nation.\nYou don\u2019t get to swap the entire demographic core and pretend nothing happened\nMy country is not just an idea it\u2019s a people. permalink award report block reply\nClarenceBeeks 2 points 9 hours ago Really says it all right there permalink award report block reply\nbarronwin 2 points 7 hours ago lmao build 10 million homes permalink award report block reply\nFusionBlack 2 points 2 hours ago Then they killed him for it. permalink award report block reply\nbarwhack 1 points 2 hours ago And they killed him for saying it. permalink award report block reply\nSteveRogers42 1 points 20 minutes ago If we do 1, we won\u2019t need to do 5. permalink award report block reply\nAlmostFullyDilated 1 points 7 hours ago wise man don't stand in path of bullet -ancient chinese proverb permalink award report block reply\nconservativefrank 1 points 1 hour ago It isn't happening with Trump.

This means goods and services designed for citizens.  This includes housing.  Getting rid of them means opening up those goods and services for Americans. H1B Visas are being used to import cheap third world labor, often (always) for jobs Americans are willing and capable of doing.  The lie about finding the talent abroad is just that - a lie.  Every single H1B sent back home is another job available for an American. Immigrants, even legal ones, take space.  Same as point 1.  Lower the caps on legal immigration and you'll see a reduction in job competition.  Remember basic economics: If you have 10 people competing for 1 job, the job sets the salary.  If you have 1 person competing for 10 jobs, the person sets the salary.  Stop overwhelming the supply of labor, and you'll see an increase in demand from jobs. Compounding on problems 1 and 3.  Chain migration should never have been a thing, just like anchor babies.  Birth Tourism is a very real, and hugely problematic thing for our country.  I can't wait for it to end so we can stop having these 9-month pregnant illegal aliens undergoing potentially dangerous border crossings just to drop their baby before they rightly get deported, then immediately claim they need to stay to keep their family together (because obviously the American child of two illegal aliens needs to stay in America, for some inexplicable reason). permalink parent award report block reply\nRaekith 11 points 9 hours ago Illegals take space.
