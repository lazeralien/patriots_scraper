(My parents comment that flying feels like you're visiting a 3rd world country now...) permalink award report block reply R3tro 2 points 5 hours ago Funny Story\u2026 last night after leaving from teaching my college class (yes , some of us based bastards due teach college)\u2026 i stopped off at trumps favorite place (Mc Donalds) to grab an ice coffee for the 45 minute ride home.  So as I stop off, a guy with a think indian accent chimes in, takes my order and tells me to pull up.  When I pull to the window, in his rough english , recites a different order.  After correcting him that the coffee shouldn\u2019t be $21.50, the other guy ( a Guatemalan I believe) steps in and corrects the Indian.  The Guatemalan tells the indian to get my coffee while the Guatemalan cashes me out.   I get my coffee, the indian guy heads back to the other drive through window, and the Guatemalan says to me in his spanish accent \u201c these indian guys\u2026 can understand them, can\u2019t train them either\u201d\u2026. I laughed so hard at this, where the guy thought I was laughing at his joke , when in fact I was laughing at the irony of the entire situation. Simply wild\u2026. permalink award report block reply GayPatriotMAGAUncle 2 points 53 minutes ago Trump never called Americans untalented you forum sliding stormfag! permalink award report block reply cosmos411 1 points 7 hours ago Just don't forget how to shower or wash your ass .. you might not like their approach. permalink award report block reply happyfave -19 points 9 hours ago Pretty sure we took all the best scientists from Germany after WW2 as well.  There is nothing wrong with bringing actual smart people into the country.  Everyone needs to fucking relax.  The people who help build missiles aren't the ones shitting in the streets and eating with their hands.    Should we limit immigration by 99% yep, but there are still skilled people we should target.  Fucking cry fest in here lately. permalink award report block reply YouEssAye 18 points 8 hours ago Germans =/= Indians We already have the O-1 visa and EB-1 visa programs for extraordinarily talented individuals.
