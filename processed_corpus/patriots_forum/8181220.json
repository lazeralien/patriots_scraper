The biggest pyramid scheme in history. permalink award report block reply thelastlast 13 points 2 days ago mandatory insurance is illegal.  so is income and property tax.  so is 'telling' us what we can eat and drink.  so is telling us how 'safe' to keep ourselves or else. we've been putting it up our whole lives.  time to start taking it back.  this country deserves better. permalink parent award report block reply IncredibleMrE1 12 points 2 days ago UHC is a perfect example. permalink award report block reply ApprenticeParty 6 points 2 days ago Lots of smaller companies literally praying on poor retards too. permalink parent award report block reply UnstableGoat 12 points 2 days ago Not only that, ACA changed the definition of Medical Loss Ratio from \u201cclaims / premiums\u201d to (claims + Quality improvement expenses) / (premiums - taxes, legal, regulatory expenses) So now there\u2019s all these bullshit job programs focused on \u201cquality initiatives\u201d that never actually improve quality and a bunch of paper-pushing functions in legal and compliance because shrug why not, they get counted in the ratio. permalink award report block reply Im_RickSteves_bitch 12 points 2 days ago Some of these people need to be in jail. permalink award report block reply Eatinglue 12 points 2 days ago It was designed to blow up our current system as an excuse to go to single payer, and all the evil and death that comes with it, probably to reduce the population to fight \u201cclimate change\u201d. permalink award report block reply pingpongdingdong 8 points 2 days ago so you\u2019re telling me government intervention broke a private enterprise system? who could have ever predicted\u2026 permalink award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 2 points 2 days ago It didn\u2019t break it, it rewarded it.  Funded by healthcare industry and they got paid big time. If we repeal it, prices have to go down.  Right now that\u2019s unheard of, prices are up 20% YoY. permalink parent award report block reply America_No_1 7 points 2 days ago The health care plan giants lobbied for this.  What better way to give them more money than to mandate more people needed to be on their plans?  And now they had full control of costs as well.  They are all in bed together with their companies and congress and our socialist commie ex-admins. permalink award report block reply ConsrvspkgNJ 6 points 2 days ago From a 30 year insurance professional specializing in Medicare and Retiree benefits....he is spot on correct. The only problem is, every solution we come up with cuts out the politicians and their grift and there is no way they will ever go with it not to mention one side of Congress is trying to pull us into Single Payor so neither side wants our private sector based solutions. permalink award report block reply cyberwar 5 points 2 days ago curse you McCain permalink award report block reply CovfefeVideo 5 points 2 days ago No one ever goes to jail.

It\u2019s simply that they aren\u2019t interested in doing their jobs because all of these benefits favor Wall Street and their donors. When the administration surrounds itself with Wall Street players, nothing will be done to help Main Street or the working man. Sure, they will feed you a constant diet of red meat and tweets that rotate daily. Enjoy it while they drain the nut sacks of the influential. permalink award report block reply IWI9000 4 points 2 days ago Until they ban vertical integrations across insurer, PBM, pharmacy, provider, GPO, distributor within healthcare and remove the antikick exemptions, it will never get better. permalink award report block reply SpeekFreely 4 points 2 days ago Sounds like a program by the insurance companies themselves./s permalink award report block reply Nibba2 4 points 2 days ago Just like military budget. Use it or lose it. So they blow it on everything at the end of the year. permalink award report block reply Naboth 2 points 2 days ago One of the reasons FSAs should be illegal, or at least have no benefit under the tax code. HSAs, on the other hand, could solve most of the health care problems in the US if they were simplified and the HDHP requirement was removed so that everyone could use them.  Properly structured, you could even use them as an alternative to medicare and medicaid, and eliminate most of the federal deficit as a side effect. Real solutions to the problem exist, but Congress will never let such solutions be implemented.  Because the insurance companies literally own them. permalink parent award report block reply h203h 3 points 2 days ago When is filthy Obama going to hang high and be executed for treason? Enough is enough with these goons getting away while the USA suffered because of these actions.

Not pointing my finger at op.  Just a general statement. War in Afghanistan was for pharma access to opioids. ACA was payment to insurance for letting poors have free drugs Poors sell their free drugs on the street or to dealers for way under pharmacy prices. America racked up in an opioid epidemic. Pharma and insurance make record profits It was all planned. They created two more entities to control Americans through. Big oil, big war, big pharma and big insurance. permalink award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 1 points 2 days ago Thanks for furthering the explanation to the common/uncommon dolts with bullet points...

What a crock that turned out to be. Big insurance profitted hugely permalink award report block reply Naboth 1 points 2 days ago Nobody who knew basic math ever thought that.  Everyone but the retards knew it was a scam from the beginning. permalink parent award report block reply Chuj 1 points 1 day ago It was seen as a bridge to universal healthcare. A way to force insurance companies out of business. That was the public front. Clearly much went on behind the scenes that the public was not aware of. permalink parent award report block reply thelastlast 1 points 2 days ago it's a little silly that people are anti-Luigi on this site. 'oh they're just fucking an entire nation of people over, causing massive loss, death and misery, a retaliation is way out of proportion.' why?  you need them to try to kill you directly?  when does self-defense kick in?  we all better start thinking about it, the bad guys have learned that parasites dont get punished but predators do, so all the predators are disguising themselves and EATING US ALIVE. permalink award report block reply anotherrandomname 1 points 2 days ago Yep obongocare was always just a massive handout to big insurance, and not even subtle about it either. permalink award report block reply\nMathletesFoot 66 points 2 days ago It's a shame the Republicans didn't do anything useful to fight or fix the underlying problem. permalink award report block reply Decepticons-superior 38 points 2 days ago That\u2019s how I became redpilled.

What better way to give them more money than to mandate more people needed to be on their plans?  And now they had full control of costs as well.  They are all in bed together with their companies and congress and our socialist commie ex-admins. permalink award report block reply\nConsrvspkgNJ 6 points 2 days ago From a 30 year insurance professional specializing in Medicare and Retiree benefits....he is spot on correct. The only problem is, every solution we come up with cuts out the politicians and their grift and there is no way they will ever go with it not to mention one side of Congress is trying to pull us into Single Payor so neither side wants our private sector based solutions. permalink award report block reply\ncyberwar 5 points 2 days ago curse you McCain permalink award report block reply\nCovfefeVideo 5 points 2 days ago No one ever goes to jail.

It\u2019s simply that they aren\u2019t interested in doing their jobs because all of these benefits favor Wall Street and their donors. When the administration surrounds itself with Wall Street players, nothing will be done to help Main Street or the working man. Sure, they will feed you a constant diet of red meat and tweets that rotate daily. Enjoy it while they drain the nut sacks of the influential. permalink award report block reply\nIWI9000 4 points 2 days ago Until they ban vertical integrations across insurer, PBM, pharmacy, provider, GPO, distributor within healthcare and remove the antikick exemptions, it will never get better. permalink award report block reply\nSpeekFreely 4 points 2 days ago Sounds like a program by the insurance companies themselves./s permalink award report block reply\nNibba2 4 points 2 days ago Just like military budget.

HSAs, on the other hand, could solve most of the health care problems in the US if they were simplified and the HDHP requirement was removed so that everyone could use them.  Properly structured, you could even use them as an alternative to medicare and medicaid, and eliminate most of the federal deficit as a side effect. Real solutions to the problem exist, but Congress will never let such solutions be implemented.  Because the insurance companies literally own them. permalink parent award report block reply\nNaboth 2 points 2 days ago One of the reasons FSAs should be illegal, or at least have no benefit under the tax code.

Not pointing my finger at op.  Just a general statement. War in Afghanistan was for pharma access to opioids. ACA was payment to insurance for letting poors have free drugs Poors sell their free drugs on the street or to dealers for way under pharmacy prices. America racked up in an opioid epidemic. Pharma and insurance make record profits It was all planned. They created two more entities to control Americans through. Big oil, big war, big pharma and big insurance. permalink award report block reply Capoditutticapi1 OP 1 points 2 days ago Thanks for furthering the explanation to the common/uncommon dolts with bullet points...
