And if you are unflagged in international waters you have to stop for any Flagged sovereign that demands it. So if they have clear smuggling behavior. Then don't stop when required to they are allowed to be stopped by any means up to killing them. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... load 1 more comments...

And I just heard some leftist, on a podcast that I listen to, spouting the leftist talking points that \"it's not even going to have that much of an effect, because that's not how most drugs make their way into the United States\". I would say 17 boats, in a couple months, is a fair amount of drugs to be taken off the streets. permalink award report block reply PearlyGaits57 1 points 5 days ago It's the LEFT. permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 5 points 6 days ago perhaps 1 to 2 tons of drugs per boat??... pure stuff... over 20 TONS of drugs - sent to sleep with the fishes. permalink award report block reply DeportThemAllForever 3 points 6 days ago Hunter Biden weekly supply permalink parent award report block reply ActNow 2 points 5 days ago If it's meth, the fish are WIDE awake. permalink parent award report block reply jsphere256 3 points 6 days ago Let us count how many airstrikes to sink the boat!

Part of me thinks that a couple real boats got blown up but the rest are just ai or props being blasted to discourage actual drug boats. permalink award report block reply The_Emperor 2 points 5 days ago Yeah, that's stupid.  Let's go ask the Commies in charge of narco trafficking who fund their crime syndicate about whether they are real boats...instead of respecting GEOTUS, Hegseth  and the greatest military in History...the force for good that is the US Navy. permalink parent award report block reply ActNow 1 points 5 days ago Venezuela is not going to confirm anything. There's some general near the top running the drug operation, so it's safe to say a chain of command would allow him to know they are real or not. If \"AI boats\" were used, they would only propagandize Americans, so not likely. permalink parent award report block reply Frenchie619 2 points 5 days ago Had it been that many already?

Most of them aren't even Americans but Iranian trolls. I've seen the damage they done in stormfront. \"White nationalist\" are now fans of Greta because she stood up against the joos. They also love Hamas, Iran, and basically Islam because they oppose the joos. Their mantra there is the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And they hate Trump, even though Trump stands up against western invasion of immigrants and islamization. To them, Trump is the friend of their enemy. They don't care that Islam is the one invading white countries. Islam is their friend because the main enemy is the joos. This groyper mentality is spreading now in PDW. Groypers are not for Trump. They must banned from PDW or else, this site will be controlled by Iranian trolls permalink parent award report block reply TDW4CBD 1 points 5 days ago Comment removed by community filter. permalink parent award report block reply PearlyGaits57 3 points 5 days ago Q, \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23!!! permalink parent award report block reply x79q3pb 2 points 6 days ago Needless division. permalink parent award report block reply\nPurple_Drank 33 points 6 days ago AH AH AH AH (in my best The Count laughter)\ud83d\ude02 permalink award report block reply Svaap 3 points 5 days ago Wow Count von Count!!

And if you are unflagged in international waters you have to stop for any Flagged sovereign that demands it. So if they have clear smuggling behavior.

There's some general near the top running the drug operation, so it's safe to say a chain of command would allow him to know they are real or not.
