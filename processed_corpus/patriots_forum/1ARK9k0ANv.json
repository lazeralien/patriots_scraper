I do not live in the US but imagine there are some people who have been on EBT for a long time. Some of those people would have no plans to get  off EBT so would be looking for other welfare to keep their (parasitic) lifestyle. I did think the twitter account was real at first until I reread it. I am just assuming that out of the millions of  people on EBT right now, some of them just watnt the government to feed them forever. But who knows, maybe I am wrong and 100% of EBT recepients are people who genuinly need it and will leave the program when they no longer need it. permalink parent award report block reply\nWhite-tailed_Eagle 1 points 1 day ago What?
