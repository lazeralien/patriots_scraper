Hitler offered a way out, by banning usury, and instating increasing mortgage forgiveness for every baby a german had.  that's why he gathered so much power so quickly... he ran on a platform of withdrawing germans from the debt slavery of a prior generation.  and ultimately when it came out who owned the bulk of that debt, it was Js.  things continued to escalate and spiral out because the debt slavers weren't going to let their debt slaves go quietly. see, usury is cancer in that it allows foreign lenders to subvert entire economies.  they make money much more available, which drives up prices, pushing more people to have to borrow to be able to afford things, which pushed up prices even more.  ALL debt spending does this, just a question of by how much. so now with debt slavery in the US continuing to climb, 50 year mortgages, student loans that are enslaving an entire generation, failing social security and medicare, and all this other broken government run wealth redistribution with no way to fund the outlays in the future other than higher and higher taxes, people are starting to wake the fuck up.  the problem isn't Trump.  the problem is the guy who comes after Trump who says the debt slavers need to be dragged into the streets, hung up on a meathook through their asshole, and then gutted like a fish... and only that because they're such vile scum that shooting them in the head execution style would be a waste of a perfectly good bullet.  they're trying to spark a totalitarian revolution, but they want it to be globalist, not nationalist.  shit, hitler was seen as far left until the 1960s when literally communist academics redefined \"national socialism\" as being right wing. coincidentally, islam bans usury across the board.  so anyone opposing banning usury is an islamophobic bigot. permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B 6 points 5 hours ago This so-called \"noticer\" is ignoring the Bank of England, and ignoring that magically somehow the London Financial District is the most expensive real estate in the world.

I was able to use the change since it wasn't all this loose bullshit worthless stuff.

In The Apartment, Jack Lemmon's character lived in an overpriced apartment in the Upper West Side of Manhattan and it was $85 per month. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 5 points 7 hours ago Yep. And they could still pay for that with 4 20s and a 5. 5 bills. Not even perfectly efficient, that would be a 50, a 20, a 10 and a 5. Now? NYC rent is 3500 a month for that. Say 3565. You need to pay that with 38 bills. And most of that is the highest denomination bills that exist. It's too fucking hard to pay shit in cash now. permalink parent award report block reply booblitchutz 2 points 7 hours ago I guess The Apartment was 1960, but it was black and white because of an artistic decision.

European countries still operated on the gold standard for a while after that.  Somehow, a guy in Philadelphia managed to get ahold of some 1933 gold double eagles from his bank, smuggled one out of the country, and King Farouk of Egypt bought it.

This estimate accounts for the U.S. Mint's cessation of penny production earlier in the year, with no new coins entering the supply since then. The figure represents the total estimated stockpile, including those actively used in transactions, held in reserves by the Federal Reserve, and stored in jars or drawers at home\u2014though many are underutilized and not frequently circulated. For context: Earlier in 2025 (February), the Federal Reserve reported about 114 billion pennies, equating to roughly $1.14 billion in value and about 700 pennies per person in the U.S. By mid-2025, estimates rose to around 240 billion as final batches from ongoing production (about 1 billion pennies minted that year) were released. Recent reports (October\u2013November 2025) from the American Bankers Association and retailers cite 250 billion, noting localized shortages due to reduced distribution rather than an overall scarcity. Pennies remain legal tender indefinitely, and it could take decades for them to naturally phase out through loss, hoarding, or melting. Countries like Canada, which stopped minting pennies in 2012, still have billions in circulation today with minimal economic disruption. permalink award report block reply Washington_Redskins 0 points 7 hours ago US Mint has produced roughly 300 billion pennies total since 1909.

FAKE NEWS. permalink award report block reply edxzxz 3 points 7 hours ago \"Today, it costs nearly 4 cents to make a penny.\"\nAlso, the entire budget for the US Mint is $5.7 Billion, so the OP's numbers are absolute bullshit.\n\"It now costs about 13.8 cents to produce a nickel, far surpassing its face value of 5 cents.

At 3.7 cents per penny that's under 150 million per year. Even if we allow for $5 billion dollars in pennies it would still be around $185 million dollars.

I'm sure people out of the US are doing this for the material, not sure how the government monitors people in the US who are melting coins, because a 1:37 payout is probably worth the risk. Shocking how much money as lost value. I recall, way back when, some Las Vegas CEO paid himself in gold coins and used the value on the coin as how much he was paid, and thus the basis for taxes.   The IRS was not humored and I recall him losing his case.  This is the poor man's analog.  I don't think you can pay your taxes in pennies at a 1:37 ratio, and I wouldn't try. permalink parent award report block reply edxzxz 2 points 7 hours ago A friend of mine was an accountant and every year at tax time he'd joke that he was going to send the IRS a toilet seat and a hammer, and claim a six figure refund, since the government pays 6 figures for toilet seats and hammers. permalink parent award report block reply Jbliss 1 points 5 hours ago The display says $85.3 Billion but the dude says $85.3 Million.

Back in Roman times it was made from pure silver and was approximately how much you would be paid for a day's unskilled labor.  Rome as an empire debased it with copper until it had only 5% silver at the end of the Roman empire.  The US penny was copied from Britain's copy of this coin and was nearly 100% copper.  It kept approximately constant value until the early 20th century.  Now the US version has destroyed its copper descendant through inflation to support its own empire.  End the empire.  End money printing.

Hitler offered a way out, by banning usury, and instating increasing mortgage forgiveness for every baby a german had.  that's why he gathered so much power so quickly... he ran on a platform of withdrawing germans from the debt slavery of a prior generation.  and ultimately when it came out who owned the bulk of that debt, it was Js.  things continued to escalate and spiral out because the debt slavers weren't going to let their debt slaves go quietly. see, usury is cancer in that it allows foreign lenders to subvert entire economies.  they make money much more available, which drives up prices, pushing more people to have to borrow to be able to afford things, which pushed up prices even more.  ALL debt spending does this, just a question of by how much. so now with debt slavery in the US continuing to climb, 50 year mortgages, student loans that are enslaving an entire generation, failing social security and medicare, and all this other broken government run wealth redistribution with no way to fund the outlays in the future other than higher and higher taxes, people are starting to wake the fuck up.  the problem isn't Trump.  the problem is the guy who comes after Trump who says the debt slavers need to be dragged into the streets, hung up on a meathook through their asshole, and then gutted like a fish... and only that because they're such vile scum that shooting them in the head execution style would be a waste of a perfectly good bullet.  they're trying to spark a totalitarian revolution, but they want it to be globalist, not nationalist.  shit, hitler was seen as far left until the 1960s when literally communist academics redefined \"national socialism\" as being right wing. coincidentally, islam bans usury across the board.  so anyone opposing banning usury is an islamophobic bigot. permalink parent award report block reply Friendly_B 6 points 5 hours ago This so-called \"noticer\" is ignoring the Bank of England, and ignoring that magically somehow the London Financial District is the most expensive real estate in the world.

This estimate accounts for the U.S. Mint's cessation of penny production earlier in the year, with no new coins entering the supply since then. The figure represents the total estimated stockpile, including those actively used in transactions, held in reserves by the Federal Reserve, and stored in jars or drawers at home\u2014though many are underutilized and not frequently circulated. For context: Earlier in 2025 (February), the Federal Reserve reported about 114 billion pennies, equating to roughly $1.14 billion in value and about 700 pennies per person in the U.S. By mid-2025, estimates rose to around 240 billion as final batches from ongoing production (about 1 billion pennies minted that year) were released. Recent reports (October\u2013November 2025) from the American Bankers Association and retailers cite 250 billion, noting localized shortages due to reduced distribution rather than an overall scarcity. Pennies remain legal tender indefinitely, and it could take decades for them to naturally phase out through loss, hoarding, or melting. Countries like Canada, which stopped minting pennies in 2012, still have billions in circulation today with minimal economic disruption. permalink award report block reply Washington_Redskins 0 points 7 hours ago US Mint has produced roughly 300 billion pennies total since 1909.

Back in Roman times it was made from pure silver and was approximately how much you would be paid for a day's unskilled labor.  Rome as an empire debased it with copper until it had only 5% silver at the end of the Roman empire.  The US penny was copied from Britain's copy of this coin and was nearly 100% copper.  It kept approximately constant value until the early 20th century.  Now the US version has destroyed its copper descendant through inflation to support its own empire.  End the empire.  End money printing.  Drain the swamp. permalink award report block reply\nJosemarti 1 points 8 hours ago I hate things like this because it's the government stated that they're giving up on fighting inflation. permalink award report block reply\nvongregormench 1 points 5 hours ago Thank god. permalink award report block reply\nNanteen 1 points 4 hours ago Deep down, I somehow feel Trump will end up with a barrel of the last pennies that they'll sell at some point permalink award report block reply\nJustjayce 1 points 10 minutes ago So nickels and dimes and quarters are the same??? permalink award report block reply\nasodfiu43253457 1 points 5 hours ago inflation making your money worthless permalink award report block reply\nTrumpIsTheVictor 1 points 4 hours ago Anyone in favor of doing away with the penny is an idiot. permalink award report block reply\nMichalusmichalus 1 points 5 hours ago A grocery store near me gave gift cards for double however many pennies people brought to the store up to $100.
