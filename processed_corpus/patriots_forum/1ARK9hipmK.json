I will say, however, that Unilever has scaled back their DEI promotion and policies recently, booted their social activist CEO, told Ben and Jerry to forget it when they offered a buy-back, and now appear to be mostly neutral, even defending themselves ina lawsuit against Ben and Jerry for exactly this, so I might buy a pint of Dublin Mudslide is it's on sale. permalink award report block reply Honkey_McCracker 9 points 2 days ago Never ate it anyway.
