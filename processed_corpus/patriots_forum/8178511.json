It won't increase the deportation numbers substantially. It's all a work. permalink award report block reply MasterChief08 2 points 3 days ago The national guard makes ICE & Border Patrol safer. That increases morale and definitely increases productivity. Sending in 200 officers into enemy territory like Portland is a huge risk. Now they have a few thousand guns pointing outwards at the rioters. The federal government is hiring 1000 new ICE agents by January and February. We don't want people quitting. Roughly 2.7 million illegal immigrants have left or been removed this year. We want that number to double next year. The goal is to completely erase the Biden invasion before the next presidential election. permalink parent award report block reply MemeWarsVet 1 points 3 days ago That is good but we need deportations to ramp up drastically. permalink parent award report block reply MasterChief08 1 points 3 days ago They will be. The BBB sets aside approximately $170 billion over four years for immigration enforcement, detention and deportation operations. By 2027 there will be 8000 new border patrol and 10k new ICE. Hiring is just ramping up. 1k new ICE employees will start by January and February. This year so far 2 million have left on their own with the incentives and 500k have been deported. It is very likely next year we will see over a million forced deportations per year. At this rate the Biden invasion will be completely erased before this term is over. This is why we need to absolutely everything possible to stop Democrats from winning power. Starting in three or four years we will be removing 10-20 million. That's when we'll start to see generational power from the left start to erode. permalink parent award report block reply\nBlackPiIIedMAGA 109 points 3 days ago THE COURTS HAVE NO POWER TO DECIDE THIS.
