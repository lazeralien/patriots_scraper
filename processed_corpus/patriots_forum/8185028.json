Graffiti, broken windows, etc. A delinquent would be more likely to continue to vandalize the second one since others have already done so. But to be the first one to throw a rock or tag with spray paint not only requires a bit of extra courage, but might bring unwanted attention to themselves since someone is obviously keeping an eye one the place.
