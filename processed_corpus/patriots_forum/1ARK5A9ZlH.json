We see them as much more.\nWhen many of us say we are proud of our white ancestors this has a kind of push or  inspirational motivation to do great things.  There are times in my life when I was having a hard time and I thought back on all of the struggles and pain of all of my ancestors and what they went through perhaps they imagined some descendant would also think back and of them, and so I push on - like they did - through wars and plagues and injustice on a scale we hardly could conceive of it. Then I think to wallow in my misery is an insult to all of them. permalink award report block reply HanginChad 3 points 3 days ago I see things a little differenty. I can really only be proud of the things I accomplish, maybe something a family member accomplished. But I'm happy I'm white, and the things other white people accomplished are awesome and obviously things they should proud of. One criticism I would have of us is that we spent way too much time fighting with each other over dumb shit. All the wars throughout history, pretty much every one of them. If we actually put all that effort into colonization the world would have been better off. We'd probably have colonies in Mars by now. We wouldn't be such a minority on earth if we didn't kill off our brothers. permalink award report block reply Gnometard -2 points 3 days ago My race has nothing to do with my life, so it's not even a thought. Only through constant exposure to CRT and communist brainwashing is race a consideration for people. I'm glad to see someone else isn't a faggot when it comes to pride. Taking pride in something that isn't an accomplishment just shows you've never actually accomplished something worth pride permalink parent award report block reply HanginChad 3 points 3 days ago That's cool. Not saying you're wrong or you don't have a right to feel that way. White people are generally pretty awesome except for the commies.

White women are the biggest voting block for democrats. Is that white culture? You're playing into the hands of the communists, because you lack sufficient testosterone to think logically. Biden is white.  Pelosi is white. Schumer is white.  Trudeau is white. Hillary Clinton is white. You don't get to ignore them because it's inconvenient, like how the left ignores Larry elder or Ben Carson. If you get to take credit for those people because skin color, it would be the same with reparations (which would happen next time white women vote in democrats, if the filibuster is done away with) permalink award report block reply RedCapNation 2 points 3 days ago White people have bad actors amongst them that\u2019s for sure. But we\u2019re the superior race and culture hands down. Nobody can argue that. Our problem is sharing technology. We should have won the world in the 40\u2019s but balked. We won\u2019t the next time. The other planets will be white only\u2026and there\u2019s little to nothing the other races can do to stop us. permalink parent award report block reply israelworst -5 points 3 days ago Is it also okay to be ambivalent about being White? Truthfully I would rather not give a shit, just so I could say that others should follow the example in their races. You see, if I go around pretending my pigments are better, whichever color that they may be, that's gay. Its just skin and most everything else in your life matters more. permalink award report block reply vote_for_MAGA_2020 6 points 3 days ago Try not to be a faggot your entire life.

In fact to have such an ambivalent attitude requires some smug elitism on a racial level.  Everyone else cares and cares deeply  - white people often feel badly for being the world champion winners in the game of civilization.
