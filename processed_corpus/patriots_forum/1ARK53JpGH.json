Truest statement I've see in a while.  Most muslim men (with the exception of mostly Americanized muslims, i.e. been here for decades or come from a civilized country such as Morocco, Algeria or UAE) think it's their right to rape you and take what they believe is theirs.  Its ingrained in them from birth by their religion.  They consider European and American women easy prey.  They would rape them in a second, with any opportunity, then walk away thinking nothing is wrong.  The same attitude is held by most of the illegal immigrants from the South.  Some of them are muslim, but the rest are told from a very young age: \"get what is yours. They (Americans) have your land and your happiness.  They don't deserve it.
