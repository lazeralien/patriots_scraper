I can't prove it outright, but my theory is that we have been purposely 'poisoned' by government directives.  We were told to eat the wrong food, which caused problems.  We were told we needed pills to address those problems, not the root cause.  The problems persist and medical care is needed as we age.  The people making the big decisions know they have mislead us for profit, and we have all been brainwashed in some way or another with their bullshit(although a lot of us here have gotten wise to the game, we all still have blind/washed spots).  AND we pay for it every step of the way.  Medical enslavement and tyranny. I think the food is the key... people are not getting enough saturated fat and protein to make their brains and bodies work right; The brains are easier to control when they are malfunctioning.  If we eat right, we feel right, we think right, we act right. permalink parent award report block reply Smurfection 3 points 3 days ago I think it's part of the replacement process too.  They want to rule over two bit thieves and crooks and moochers who are too illiterate, too unschooled and too unsophisticated to understand the deep deceit embedded in communism.   It's why no developed nation has ever installed communism.  Communist revolutions only happened in nations with peasants, aristocrats and widespread reliance on manual labor.
