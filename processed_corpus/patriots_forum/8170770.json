This has been happening for many decades, and it should have been obvious that something was seriously wrong when normal people found out these things weren't being reported. I tell you what, the Communists see these shootings happen, and they talk about it. When they are the only ones talking about it, they bring a lot of people over to their side. Trump saw these shooting happen, and he talked about it in 2016. It made him very popular. Bringing the national guard into Memphis to clean up crime has been one of the biggest wins of the year for the Republican party, and yet nobody talks about it. That's why Republicans lose. permalink parent award report block reply Aambrick 2 points 6 days ago Its not that they don't talk about it, but its when they start that everyone else do their best to silence it via silencing, discrediting, or even being so loud on other topics which falls under not reporting or making it so minimal in time spent that just a paragraph mentioned at the bottom of the screen on tv or in a news feed on a smart phone.

The parable Jesus told of the Good Samaritan was meant to teach this idea. You will not find this outlook in other religions or political systems. Virtually everywhere else, it is perfectly normal and actually expected that you can treat outsiders any way you like. You can cheat them, lie to them, steal from them, use them, buy them, sell them, and even kill them without consequence. As long as you treat your own immediate family well, and your own small tribe well, using outsiders is just the way life is. It's how you survive and, sometimes, grow rich. But those in the West do not understand that. They think everybody is just like we are and follows all the same rules. They don't. Not even close. And even if they claim to be Christian/Catholic, many, many people in South and Central America trace their ancestors to the Mayans and Aztecs, two very bloodthirsty cultures. (Drug cartels are the descendants of those same groups.) permalink parent award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 4 points 6 days ago We're all reading the parable of the Good Samaritan wrong. The Levite and the Pharisee in the parable rightly saw the potential \"charity\" trap -- helping such a person would likely in reality lead to being robbed, and indeed the injured man may likely have been part of such a trap. The Good Samaritan is not just some strange rando who we're supposed to accept as the model of a perfect person. The Good Samaritan is the Savior Himself. He came prepared not just for a random encounter, but rather specifically for the injured man, prepared for his injuries, transport and to provide for his care. Who are YOU in the parable? YOU are the \"certain man\" who is set upon by thieves, left bruised and broken for Jesus to pick you up. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 1 points 6 days ago a crown of love is being twined for him who loves his neighbour permalink parent award report block reply Long_time_lurker 3 points 6 days ago The concept of \"treat everyone fairly and equally\" is part of Western civilization. I think it's part of how we got our civilization, by being better at cooperating, despite everything.  And now we have people joining it for benefits and instead diluting the trust which makes people willing to cooperate in the first place instead of assimilating. Then we have the pro-crime commies and few consequences for being arrested 127 times, when such people need to be removed from society. permalink parent award report block reply HazelHen 3 points 6 days ago One day, you may mature and realize all of politics and civilization itself boils down to tribe, to kin, to biology. Western civilization\u2019s forms of government only work in an ethnically homogeneous, high-trust society (both of these correlate). This has been known even since antiquity as Ancient Greek writers explicitly discussed this because they had observations of their own.\nEverything is downstream of how homogeneous a society is. Hell, even the character of the US started to shift, potentially for the worse, when it deviated form the founding WASP stock with the importations of other Europeans. Today, the US in its current form is lost cause without currently unthinkable repatriations, or complete politicsl separation, of nons and all those tainted with the mind virus. permalink parent award report block reply InternetSolutions 3 points 6 days ago Virtually everywhere else, it is perfectly normal and actually expected that you can treat outsiders any way you like. You can cheat them, lie to them, steal from them, use them, buy them, sell them, and even kill them without consequence. Well said. When rich arab countries recruit foreign laborers from India or Philippines, it is common to essentially enslave them by indebting them for the cost of food & rent, then making them \"earn\" their way out of debt and sent home 2-3 years later with little money to show for it. The arab companies also hold onto their money, passports, travel documents, and any other important paperwork that would let them go back to their home country. permalink parent award report block reply BeauHD 1 points 6 days ago Don't feed the bots, man! permalink parent award report block reply Govtizbad 4 points 6 days ago Comment removed upon the user being banned. permalink parent award report block reply Decepticons-superior 4 points 6 days ago Reminds me of those two idiots who quit their fancy jobs and decided to ride bicycles across the continents.

I've even heard Don Jr. do it. permalink award report block reply StruggleSession 3 points 6 days ago It's complicated. The theory presented in the book The Devil's Chessboard suggests that Senator Joseph McCarthy was initially a covertly managed asset for the powerful Dulles brothers: Allen Dulles, Director of the CIA, and John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State. Rather than being a purely independent crusader against communism, McCarthy allegedly received leaked intelligence from the Dulles network. This information served a dual purpose: first, it validated McCarthy's public anti-communist standing during the heightened Cold War fear; second, and more critically, it allowed the Dulles-led security state to strategically purge its political and organizational enemies from government agencies by branding them as security risks or communist sympathizers. McCarthy was, in this view, a useful political bomb employed to restructure the federal bureaucracy to their liking. McCarthy's career began to unravel when he lost the crucial support of the intelligence establishment. The turning point came when the Senator began to set his sights and investigative crosshairs on the very agencies that had tacitly supported him, particularly the CIA. Allen Dulles viewed any scrutiny of the CIA as a fundamental threat to its secret operations and independence, making McCarthy a liability rather than an asset. By challenging the institution that the Dulles brothers had built into a self-governing power, McCarthy signaled his loss of control and his new status as a dangerous rogue element. The final act of McCarthy's professional demise was his public attack on the U.S. Army, culminating in the televised Army-McCarthy Hearings. This aggressive action alienated him from the military and, crucially, from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. With the CIA refusing to feed him information, and the Executive Branch and military establishment actively opposing him, McCarthy had lost his political shield and operational intelligence source. His increasingly erratic behavior during the hearings exposed him to public condemnation, leading directly to his censure by the Senate and the effective end of his influential, yet controversial, career. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago Thank you! permalink parent award report block reply anon2309011 3 points 6 days ago We let them stop him with a new made up \"ism\". permalink award report block reply MkultraUSA 3 points 6 days ago He was in the Senate and had nothing to do with HUAC, He was concerned about the state department and the department of the Army.

The parable Jesus told of the Good Samaritan was meant to teach this idea. You will not find this outlook in other religions or political systems. Virtually everywhere else, it is perfectly normal and actually expected that you can treat outsiders any way you like. You can cheat them, lie to them, steal from them, use them, buy them, sell them, and even kill them without consequence. As long as you treat your own immediate family well, and your own small tribe well, using outsiders is just the way life is. It's how you survive and, sometimes, grow rich. But those in the West do not understand that. They think everybody is just like we are and follows all the same rules. They don't. Not even close. And even if they claim to be Christian/Catholic, many, many people in South and Central America trace their ancestors to the Mayans and Aztecs, two very bloodthirsty cultures. (Drug cartels are the descendants of those same groups.) permalink parent award report block reply CommanderOfCheese 4 points 6 days ago We're all reading the parable of the Good Samaritan wrong. The Levite and the Pharisee in the parable rightly saw the potential \"charity\" trap -- helping such a person would likely in reality lead to being robbed, and indeed the injured man may likely have been part of such a trap. The Good Samaritan is not just some strange rando who we're supposed to accept as the model of a perfect person. The Good Samaritan is the Savior Himself. He came prepared not just for a random encounter, but rather specifically for the injured man, prepared for his injuries, transport and to provide for his care. Who are YOU in the parable?

The theory presented in the book The Devil's Chessboard suggests that Senator Joseph McCarthy was initially a covertly managed asset for the powerful Dulles brothers: Allen Dulles, Director of the CIA, and John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State. Rather than being a purely independent crusader against communism, McCarthy allegedly received leaked intelligence from the Dulles network. This information served a dual purpose: first, it validated McCarthy's public anti-communist standing during the heightened Cold War fear; second, and more critically, it allowed the Dulles-led security state to strategically purge its political and organizational enemies from government agencies by branding them as security risks or communist sympathizers. McCarthy was, in this view, a useful political bomb employed to restructure the federal bureaucracy to their liking. McCarthy's career began to unravel when he lost the crucial support of the intelligence establishment. The turning point came when the Senator began to set his sights and investigative crosshairs on the very agencies that had tacitly supported him, particularly the CIA. Allen Dulles viewed any scrutiny of the CIA as a fundamental threat to its secret operations and independence, making McCarthy a liability rather than an asset. By challenging the institution that the Dulles brothers had built into a self-governing power, McCarthy signaled his loss of control and his new status as a dangerous rogue element. The final act of McCarthy's professional demise was his public attack on the U.S. Army, culminating in the televised Army-McCarthy Hearings. This aggressive action alienated him from the military and, crucially, from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. With the CIA refusing to feed him information, and the Executive Branch and military establishment actively opposing him, McCarthy had lost his political shield and operational intelligence source. His increasingly erratic behavior during the hearings exposed him to public condemnation, leading directly to his censure by the Senate and the effective end of his influential, yet controversial, career. permalink parent award report block reply SicSemperTyrannis2 1 points 6 days ago Thank you! permalink parent award report block reply\nStruggleSession 3 points 6 days ago It's complicated.
