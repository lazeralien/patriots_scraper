The car was 17.5' long and weighted 5200 lbs.  He still had the window sticker from the dealer.  It cost around $5500 in '77, about a dollar a pound!  The 460 cu.in. beast of a motor got 10 mpg. The doors were about a foot thick and close to 5' long!  It was pale yellow, with a full black vinyl top.  Black leather interior.  You should have seen my five foot tall wife driving it!
