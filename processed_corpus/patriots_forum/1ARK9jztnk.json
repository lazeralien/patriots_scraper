Asian spikenard--the perfume you mentioned--is the essential oil of Nardostachys jatamansi. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nardostachys It is a source of a type of intensely aromatic amber-colored essential oil, spikenard. The oil has, since ancient times, been used as a perfume, as a traditional medicine, and in religious ceremonies. It is also called spikenard, nard, nardin, or muskroot.* This is also interesting.   The gospel, according to some bish name Qwen via Brave LEO LLM: Mary of Bethany used her own expensive perfume, likely a family heirloom worth a year\u2019s wages. The objection came primarily from Judas Iscariot, who complained it should have been sold and given to the poor\u2014but the Gospel of John clarifies he did not care about the poor, as he was a thief who stole from the disciples\u2019 money bag (John 12:6). While some disciples also questioned the act (Matthew 26:8, Mark 14:4), Jesus defended Mary, calling it a \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d and stating she had anointed him for his burial (Mark 14:6\u20138). He emphasized that her devotion was more important in that moment than even charitable giving. SO if \"Qwen\" is correct, then Christians throughout history are still getting on this poor woman's case based on the insistence of JUDAS Why the F do we care what Judas thinks? Forgive this Mary, and remember how she was a great Patriot to Jesus.  The best kind.  Using her family heirloom on him. She did it right permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch 3 points 1 day ago Also, I obtained this essential oil before.

Taxing the rich won't really help the poor. Reducing government regulations likely would, but they don't want that.

AOC and Bernie Sanders come to mind, how many poor people have they helped while they, themselves, became multimillionaires who aren't remotely interested in redistributing their own ill-gained wealth?

It\u2019s ok to be a millionaire rich hypocrite asshole but not a billionaire in liberal clowntown. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 1 points 1 day ago Ah but it most certainly IS okay to be a billionaire, provided you have the right opinions! permalink parent award report block reply 5DchessWatch 2 points 1 day ago All taxes should go away except for sales tax and it should never ever be higher than 25% and it should apply equally to ALL sale items.  12.5% goes to the state in which the item or service is sold, 12.5% goes to federal.   Federal obligations to state, therefore, should only be supplemental. People should be allowed to give more taxes voluntarily.  25% is the minimum.  And the additional amount should be voluntarily recorded in a kind of public leaderboard, so people can prove they gave to charity, if they want to.  But they don't have to.  It can be recorded with or without your name.  You could record it anonymously in such a way that you could prove it in court (unseal the name) if you ever have to. permalink award report block reply 5DchessWatch 1 points 1 day ago So for example, if you're a p diddy and you are in court, and you're a multi millionaire rich guy having orgies and such but you gave tremendously to the public for the public good, they might (\"ought to\"--I would) consider this in any punishments. permalink parent award report block reply GhostOfTheRepublic 2 points 1 day ago 100% permalink award report block reply Ferretman 2 points 1 day ago Accurate. permalink award report block reply behemoth887 2 points 1 day ago tax the rich by passing investment focused taxes that can be easily dodged by the rich but not dodged by the middle class permalink award report block reply Mungo 2 points 1 day ago Exactly permalink award report block reply blitzstrasse 2 points 1 day ago That's God's own truth. permalink award report block reply Another_rando 2 points 1 day ago It also assumes that taxes go back to the government and then the people.

So what? Recognizing this doesn't do anything substantive for us. While this administration and the Republican party continues to give Israel blowjobs and paying them for the trouble, the American people are in a cost of living crisis. Things are not getting better. Every day, week, month and year that we continue running a gargantuan budgetary deficit means every single American is taxed via inflation. We have had ZERO solutions to this issue. Not only that, but the Trump administration has been made to look totally ineffective and weak as a result of the government shutdown. A MINORITY PARTY shut down the government. The fact that everyone here knows the filibuster won't be removed by republicans despite President Trump's tweets is sad and pathetic. It's illustrative of how utterly weak and useless elected Republicans are. It demoralizes the base, and will be part of the reason 2026 is going to be an even worse wipeout than 2018. The base is at the end of its rope. The American people are at the end of their rope. Between a politician offering a shitty solution that makes them feel good or no solution, guess which one they will be picking? This year has been the biggest blue balls for voters of a President in American history. We started off so promising with energy and movement, executive orders and Democrats in disarray. Then we got Scam Blondi. Then we got bug-eyed patel. Then we got no Epstein list. Then we got foreign interventions on behalf of Israel. All the while, the people are suffering under a cost of living crisis. ZERO solutions have been proposed about this. The President has wasted this year chasing after his own tail in international politics while utterly neglecting domestic policy. Just like every Republican President since Eisenhower. Buy ammo and stock up on beans my friends. JD Vindaloo isn't going to be any better. permalink award report block reply DanIsSwell 1 points 1 day ago Yes, and who benefits off of higher taxes? The tax collectors themselves. They do whatever they want with it, and we have no benefit and no say. Anyone who\u2019s really waking up wants NO taxes until we can fix this grifting system. The same low IQ liberals call for raising minimum wage, so the burden falls on businesses owners, who then go out of business.

Taxing the rich won't really help the poor. Reducing government regulations likely would, but they don't want that. They want a totalitarian government, and taxing the rich disproportionately is a step in hat direction. permalink award report block reply booblitchutz 5 points 1 day ago \u201cHelp the poor\u201d tries to help poor white people in Appalachia \u201cNOOOO NOT THOSE POOR!!!\u201d permalink parent award report block reply\nbooblitchutz 5 points 1 day ago \u201cHelp the poor\u201d tries to help poor white people in Appalachia \u201cNOOOO NOT THOSE POOR!!!\u201d permalink parent award report block reply\nDev404 5 points 1 day ago Socialists/communists are what they've always been - losers who want to partake in the winnings without putting in the effort.

Federal obligations to state, therefore, should only be supplemental. People should be allowed to give more taxes voluntarily.  25% is the minimum.  And the additional amount should be voluntarily recorded in a kind of public leaderboard, so people can prove they gave to charity, if they want to.  But they don't have to.  It can be recorded with or without your name.  You could record it anonymously in such a way that you could prove it in court (unseal the name) if you ever have to. permalink award report block reply 5DchessWatch 1 points 1 day ago So for example, if you're a p diddy and you are in court, and you're a multi millionaire rich guy having orgies and such but you gave tremendously to the public for the public good, they might (\"ought to\"--I would) consider this in any punishments. permalink parent award report block reply\n5DchessWatch 1 points 1 day ago So for example, if you're a p diddy and you are in court, and you're a multi millionaire rich guy having orgies and such but you gave tremendously to the public for the public good, they might (\"ought to\"--I would) consider this in any punishments. permalink parent award report block reply\nGhostOfTheRepublic 2 points 1 day ago 100% permalink award report block reply\nFerretman 2 points 1 day ago Accurate. permalink award report block reply\nbehemoth887 2 points 1 day ago tax the rich by passing investment focused taxes that can be easily dodged by the rich but not dodged by the middle class permalink award report block reply\nMungo 2 points 1 day ago Exactly permalink award report block reply\nblitzstrasse 2 points 1 day ago That's God's own truth. permalink award report block reply\nAnother_rando 2 points 1 day ago It also assumes that taxes go back to the government and then the people.

So what? Recognizing this doesn't do anything substantive for us. While this administration and the Republican party continues to give Israel blowjobs and paying them for the trouble, the American people are in a cost of living crisis. Things are not getting better. Every day, week, month and year that we continue running a gargantuan budgetary deficit means every single American is taxed via inflation. We have had ZERO solutions to this issue. Not only that, but the Trump administration has been made to look totally ineffective and weak as a result of the government shutdown. A MINORITY PARTY shut down the government. The fact that everyone here knows the filibuster won't be removed by republicans despite President Trump's tweets is sad and pathetic. It's illustrative of how utterly weak and useless elected Republicans are. It demoralizes the base, and will be part of the reason 2026 is going to be an even worse wipeout than 2018. The base is at the end of its rope. The American people are at the end of their rope. Between a politician offering a shitty solution that makes them feel good or no solution, guess which one they will be picking? This year has been the biggest blue balls for voters of a President in American history. We started off so promising with energy and movement, executive orders and Democrats in disarray. Then we got Scam Blondi. Then we got bug-eyed patel. Then we got no Epstein list. Then we got foreign interventions on behalf of Israel. All the while, the people are suffering under a cost of living crisis. ZERO solutions have been proposed about this. The President has wasted this year chasing after his own tail in international politics while utterly neglecting domestic policy. Just like every Republican President since Eisenhower. Buy ammo and stock up on beans my friends. JD Vindaloo isn't going to be any better. permalink award report block reply\nDanIsSwell 1 points 1 day ago Yes, and who benefits off of higher taxes? The tax collectors themselves. They do whatever they want with it, and we have no benefit and no say. Anyone who\u2019s really waking up wants NO taxes until we can fix this grifting system. The same low IQ liberals call for raising minimum wage, so the burden falls on businesses owners, who then go out of business.
