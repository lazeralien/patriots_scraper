Shreveport is a perfect city for his plans. It is nationally centrally located, it's on the crux of major transportation passages and the Mississippi, it is dirt cheap land, and is in desperate need of things to bring in outside investment besides the casino and the LSU medical school. AND what's more (this is a big thing others like me are watching the Capital too) this will show to our State government (and King Landry) that the north of the State needs just as much if not more help with infrastructure than the south and can't be ignored any longer! I remember even back 50 years ago, my MaMa and PaPa on my father's side who lived in Avoyelles Parish (CenLa also needs some help too for that matter, though not as bad as the north) would say something like: \"From Minden to Spearsville to Jonesboro, that's the Black Triangle. The lights go out the more people move away, there's nothing that grows well there, and those who live there find themselves stuck.\" In the 1970s, even the 80s, Shreveport was a bustling city.
