If they are getting paid twice, why doesn't the govt have processes in place to prevent it? Is someone spending the SNAP of the 5000 dead people bc of fraud or is it that the govt hasn't had a chance to cut the money off bc no one reported them dead? Five thousand seems too low for fraud. I'd like to know if this is hyperbole before I react. permalink award report block reply SimaYi 0 points 9 hours ago Don't worry your pretty little head about it. I'm sure it's all legit. I mean, why would anyone defraud the government at the taxpayers expense? Probably never happens. People are way too honorable for such misdeeds.

George Washington can't hold a job anymore, and probably doesn't get any social security money either.  How is he supposed to afford groceries?\nEspecially now that one Porterhouse steak costs more than a full cow did in his day.

When the states are found corrupt, the feds, who represent tax paying citizens, MUST be held accountable.  If it means sending the governors to prison and or fines and other penalties ...then that the way it must be.   Without accountability and punishment our laws are meaningless. permalink award report block reply SimaYi 2 points 9 hours ago Best we can do is infinity H1B from India.

If they are getting paid twice, why doesn't the govt have processes in place to prevent it? Is someone spending the SNAP of the 5000 dead people bc of fraud or is it that the govt hasn't had a chance to cut the money off bc no one reported them dead? Five thousand seems too low for fraud. I'd like to know if this is hyperbole before I react. permalink award report block reply SimaYi 0 points 9 hours ago Don't worry your pretty little head about it. I'm sure it's all legit. I mean, why would anyone defraud the government at the taxpayers expense? Probably never happens. People are way too honorable for such misdeeds.
