The US is FULL as far as I'm concerned. And once again I have to point out: DHS/State Department has tried to deport a student for writing a school news article critical of Israel. When they say they are screening for supporting terrorism, this is what they mean. Not sending money to ISIS or planning a terror attack. You know, things that can actually lead to harming Americans. permalink award report block reply PearlyGaits57 3 points 7 hours ago I will say it again \"DEPORT\" permalink award report block reply ScoobyDum 3 points 8 hours ago Trump is speeding up our replacement, what the fuck permalink award report block reply T471 3 points 8 hours ago Idiotic statement, no need for this shit to continue. permalink award report block reply NotYourMan 1 points 7 hours ago We don't want this.
