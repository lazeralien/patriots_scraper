You can drink drain cleaner, if you're dumb enough, but raw milk is somehow illegal? permalink parent award report block reply Bullet3250 4 points 2 days ago When I was just a young sprout - we still had milkman delivery's to the house - every 2 days or so. Fresh milk in glass bottles - empties went back -  pretty cheap too.  I do think it was pasteurized... that was still kind of a big thing.. But raw milk is even better for you.  It's my guess that it was pasteurization that altered milk - altered 'gut bacteria' in 80% of the population - and caused mass Depression and other ills the Nation seemed to suffer - out of no where. permalink parent award report block reply fazaman 4 points 2 days ago Sure. My point is that it's different from what most people are used to, and can be more dangerous, but really it's in the farmer's best interest that things are kept as safe as possible for his customers. I remember I had a raw milk milkshake once when I was a kid. I don't remember much about it, but I remember that it was good! I doubt pasteurization causes depression or whatever. It's fine to drink. But there's probably benefits that are lost by doing it. A tradeoff for the benefits of pasteurization, really. Pasteurization is good, but to effectively mandate it is ridiculous government overreach. If I have a dairy farm nearby and I want to go and stick my house with exclusively raw milk instead of pasteurized, I should definitely be allowed to do so. permalink parent award report block reply squash1324 2 points 2 days ago Altered gut bacteria is from glyphosate.

Meanwhile 90% of the stuff is bought in bulk. Just displayed folksy and people dont question it.

But people think its better and pay twice as much. permalink parent award report block reply NADSAQ 5 points 2 days ago As a chef, I get roped into going to farmers markets with people and it\u2019s this same story every time in every city. permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 2 points 2 days ago We ran it a bit different. It was what seasonal for our area. Citrus was from my friends family in south florida. Everything else was local. We had schedules and order books passed out to customers. Beef was on a preorder basis too. I spent alot of my free time making those order books. I only asked for cost on those. $3. They got passed around anyway. Lol permalink parent award report block reply Katarina_Reset 6 points 2 days ago I've been wiring up some coolers and freezers for a new local, small meat processing plant. The prices are very reasonable. It comes out to About 4.50/lb if you buy a half/whole cow. They're very clean and I've never heard one animal struggle. It has definitely given me a new found respect for a steak permalink parent award report block reply KernalMustard 1 points 2 days ago They dont. I never did it myself though. We had a small slaughter house do it for us. They were reasonable. It was well run. When it was time I would bring 5 at a time. Steers got sent. Heifers were sold to anyone who needed one. Anything left went to the livestock market. I had it all covered. permalink parent award report block reply Hambonemcgee 4 points 2 days ago Some of them will definitely gouge you.

Lower regulations and let them compete. Imagine if all the small rural properties could raise a few cattle and sell them. We could increase the number of cattle in this country rapidly. I want to see beef prices cut in half at least. permalink award report block reply schiff_for_brains 3 points 2 days ago Out here a few small scale cattle farms bought a sausage factory and converted it to processing their own herds.

They already can, they just sell them still mooing. You half beef prices and they then need to absorb the cost of slaughter while already not getting paid shit. Beef prices need to increase to increase the number of cattle. permalink parent award report block reply ChicagoforTrump 2 points 2 days ago We need to cut out the middle man and let the farmers sell directly to grocery stores locally. The bottle neck is the processing.  Everything needs to be inspected by the FDA multiple times which keeps prices high and farmers broke. The meat packers make all the money. permalink parent award report block reply RedStoneDeepState 1 points 2 days ago Prices still need to rise for ranchers to make any real money permalink parent award report block reply ChicagoforTrump 1 points 2 days ago Prices are at an all time high. Please tell me how they aren't making any money if they made money selling at lower prices years ago? The problem is not prices, the problem is costs associated with regulation and meat packing. permalink parent award report block reply view 1 more comments... localhost 8 points 2 days ago Please please please also go after Sysco.

What I don't understand, to this day, is the fear people have criticizing our shit-for-brains government decisions.  On the contrary, we have a citizenry that seems to suck the government dick in all things they do, and will happily snitch on the local businesses doing their thing. I hate the government so fucking much,.  This post is getting long, and I know that robs attention away, but I've firsthand encountered these shit-for-brains fedocrats, given these extremely cushy government jobs.  They think they are the smartest people to ever walk the face of the earth - a view promoted by their own culture.  I tore this yankee bitch apart when he came here.  He thought he was smart with his cornell education.  He thought he was an academic of the highest order.  He was an ant, looking at a shrub, contemplating the universe.  Also a psychopath - which is how he defends his ego.  Discussions are not in good faith - they are \"stroke my ego I come after you with the full force of the government\".

We had a small slaughter house do it for us. They were reasonable. It was well run. When it was time I would bring 5 at a time. Steers got sent. Heifers were sold to anyone who needed one. Anything left went to the livestock market. I had it all covered. permalink parent award report block reply\nKernalMustard 1 points 2 days ago They dont. I never did it myself though.

Lower regulations and let them compete. Imagine if all the small rural properties could raise a few cattle and sell them. We could increase the number of cattle in this country rapidly.
