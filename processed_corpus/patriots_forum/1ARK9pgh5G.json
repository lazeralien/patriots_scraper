Not one can figure out crude plumbing? All that money they scam from us, they cant start a trash service? Motherfucker, import a garbage truck instead of a racecar.\n7 comments Sort by Top Top New Worst Old Save Throwingway22 2 points 18 minutes ago India has an average IQ in the \"mentally retarded\" range. If only the higher IQ ones, who understandably don't want to live in a country dominated by their co-ethnics, could've set aside their ethnic-nepotism, they probably could've done fine. But they pushed too hard. Scammed too many times. No one wants to be around any pajeets anymore. permalink award report block reply Trooph-Hurts 2 points 1 hour ago That\u2019s because they have open sewage drainage and extension cord electricity in India! permalink award report block reply CloudNine 2 points 1 hour ago Just string those power wires around the tree,, up over the roof, down the chimney, then connect to 40 apartments.

The questions not being asked are; 1.define talent. 2 If talent is medical doctors and engineers how is that going to impact their countries? I think everyone knows those answers and that's why everyone is furious. permalink award report block reply Elencher 2 points 10 minutes ago My theory is that the push for AI in software is because of the jeets. They've imported too many dispshits and think AI is the way they can get something out of it because they can't code for shit on their own. permalink parent award report block reply\nThrowingway22 2 points 18 minutes ago India has an average IQ in the \"mentally retarded\" range.
